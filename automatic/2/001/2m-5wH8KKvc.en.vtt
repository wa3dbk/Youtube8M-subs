00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.950
 l'aquila is a horse for everyone 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.539
 fall also the german derby win 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.920
 can and the coach has a whole 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.920
 special relationship to this horse 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.829
 his career is here alone 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.739
 actually meet this year 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.210
 but 100 convinced once run 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.160
 won three times in three times 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.730
 winning way 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.970
 From the paper is from the father's side 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.610
 Sufficiency is sufficient there so that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.980
 So there I am very confident what 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 as far as the distance is concerned and from his 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.180
 power and there class has it anyway 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.280
 really not always easy though 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.930
 He has significantly improved it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.960
 just be his character and his temperament 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.140
 it as well right now at everything 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.179
 interested in what happens around him 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.899
 and went so far as ever as a 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:14.600
 extreme as for example before the menu into the race 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.100
 that you even had to face it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
 the race too much spent 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.009
 but he has just as many as I do 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.570
 reserves and leave as much power press 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.850
 can compensate and so what 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.820
 I'll be the Frenchman again 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.819
 if that choice ride him too 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 had ridden in the classic more only 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.020
 In the race the same man had a little one 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.289
 is in the very best 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.310
 Constitution weight is ideal coalition 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.830
 is ideal and I will be his is 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.670
 unbroken keeps perfect there a very 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.039
 has very strong speed is a fast 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.789
 rally good for him and that's derby 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.789
 almost always the case
