00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and move on the last category that I'm

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.109 
and move on the last category that I'm
going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.320> covering<00:01:55.680> today<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> rate

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
going to be covering today is the rate

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
going to be covering today is the rate
of<00:01:57.149> fire<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.710> Ripper<00:01:58.979> wins<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.759> with<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
of fire and the Ripper wins here with a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.069 
of fire and the Ripper wins here with a
fast<00:02:01.340> 900<00:02:02.340> round<00:02:02.670> rate<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> fire<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> M

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
fast 900 round rate of fire over the M

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.459 
fast 900 round rate of fire over the M
tars<00:02:04.549> 810<00:02:05.549> round<00:02:05.969> rate<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> fire<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
tars 810 round rate of fire and the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410 
tars 810 round rate of fire and the
Ripper<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.280> dropped<00:02:08.550> people<00:02:08.879> quickly<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
Ripper really dropped people quickly and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.790 
Ripper really dropped people quickly and
that's<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> things<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that's one one of the things that I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
that's one one of the things that I
really<00:02:10.950> love<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.120> mtar<00:02:12.450> still

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
really love about it and the mtar still

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
really love about it and the mtar still
does<00:02:12.959> but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
does but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
does but
gonna<00:02:13.950> take<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.610> tad<00:02:14.850> longer<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
gonna take you just a tad longer and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.760 
gonna take you just a tad longer and
that<00:02:15.570> could<00:02:15.840> be<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> big<00:02:16.110> deal<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.710> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
that could be a big deal in a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.770 
that could be a big deal in a
close-quarters<00:02:17.340> gunfight<00:02:18.030> let's<00:02:18.570> go<00:02:18.750> ahead

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
close-quarters gunfight let's go ahead

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.020 
close-quarters gunfight let's go ahead
and<00:02:19.020> look<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> categories<00:02:20.130> divided<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.850> as

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and look at the categories divided up as

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.720 
and look at the categories divided up as
to<00:02:21.540> who<00:02:21.660> won<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.350> think<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:22.980> hard<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> believe

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to who won I think it's hard to believe

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
to who won I think it's hard to believe
but<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> looks<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.690> Ripper<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.260> bit<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but it looks like the Ripper is a bit of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
but it looks like the Ripper is a bit of
a<00:02:26.130> better<00:02:26.340> weapon<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> mtar<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.420> still<00:02:27.690> like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
a better weapon in the mtar I still like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.990 
a better weapon in the mtar I still like
the<00:02:27.930> mtar<00:02:28.380> better<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> rippers<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the mtar better but the rippers got the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.900 
the mtar better but the rippers got the
stats<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.690> show<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.260> taking<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.100> rate<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.520> fire

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
stats to show it taking the rate of fire

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.750 
stats to show it taking the rate of fire
the<00:02:33.300> squad<00:02:33.780> point<00:02:34.110> value<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.130> reload

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the squad point value and the reload

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.970 
the squad point value and the reload
