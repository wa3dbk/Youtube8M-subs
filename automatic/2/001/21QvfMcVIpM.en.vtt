00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
they're just a higher set eye but if you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.740 
they're just a higher set eye but if you
put<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.100> lower<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.700> look<00:02:47.850> really<00:02:48.150> great<00:02:48.300> so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
