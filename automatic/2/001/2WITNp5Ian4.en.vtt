 it will be to block your home 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.870
 multiplayer online and have the choice 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.460
 of the same two cards so you go on 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 a multiplayer mode so no matter 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.000
 which except a mode to confrontations 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.250
 it does not work in confrontation - 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.839
 the occurrence I was in infect so 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.369
 you put on infected on the mode of 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.259
 game you want but you do not run 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.340
 no you go to the main menu 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.140
 once you are in the menu 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.520
 main you click on multiplayer 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.320
 and at the same time you click 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.789
 multiplayer you press ps button 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.740
 if all goes well you will need frieze 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.319
 a little bit after the end of loading 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.849
 so that will put you the loadings 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.349
 before accessing the multiplayer so there 

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.989
 you strafe your ps button 

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:28.899
 so it flickers ps menu I ps menu I 

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:31.450
 game ps menu and you do this up 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.950
 click to go to infect 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.479
 you do not stop pressing the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.399
 ps1 button anyway you can only 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.869
 you do not miss it is very simple and 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.670
 when you click on infected you 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.770
 will have choices between the same two cards 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 and savoring that will put you on hold 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.009
 five extra players and well there 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.140
 you invite your friends list your 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.970
 directory of people they are going to be 6 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 for the party to launch so you do not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.619
 return to you will not meet forgiveness 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.119
 people the welcome is blocked only 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.780
 you invite them where they join you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.090
 once you are 6 the party gets 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
 automatically launches from me I took 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.720
 a little time to group the six 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.550
 people I did a little 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.200
 cutoff and when the sixth person 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.929
 happen you see that the teams are going 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.250
 so train the teams for the team 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.260
 quickly done in affect ya not really 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.900
 of equipped is the part to get started 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.870
 so can you play the mode you have 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.939
 chosen in private part the xp that counts 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.170
 is only between friends so like that 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.980
 you will not be bothered by the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.989
 people who are 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.909
 online you will be able to do what you 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.680
 so you can think of boost 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.819
 I personally do not care what 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.150
 you do it I do that you 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.760
 introduce and then so you touch 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.900
 you can xp with your friends so here you go 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.220

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.690
