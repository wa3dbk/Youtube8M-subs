00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
just stuck here I can't move my

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920 
just stuck here I can't move my
character<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.480> looks<00:02:27.659> like<00:02:27.720> I'm

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
character and it just looks like I'm

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.449 
character and it just looks like I'm
staring<00:02:28.349> at<00:02:28.440> her<00:02:28.530> titties<00:02:28.860> coming<00:02:29.220> up<00:02:29.310> with

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
staring at her titties coming up with

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
staring at her titties coming up with
some<00:02:29.640> type<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:29.879> elaborate<00:02:30.450> scheme<00:02:30.870> for

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
some type of elaborate scheme for

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
some type of elaborate scheme for
fisting<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.010> her<00:02:32.160> vaginas

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
fisting all of her vaginas

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.850 
fisting all of her vaginas
now<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> had<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.930> once<00:02:34.140> again<00:02:34.260> work<00:02:34.590> out<00:02:34.799> a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
now I had to once again work out a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.619 
now I had to once again work out a
workaround<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.879> bullshit

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
workaround for this bullshit

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.300 
workaround for this bullshit
so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> decided<00:02:37.349> let's<00:02:37.560> try<00:02:37.709> talking<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.129> her

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
so I decided let's try talking to her

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.280 
so I decided let's try talking to her
over<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> counter<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.510> there's<00:02:39.720> no<00:02:39.840> risk<00:02:40.049> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
over the counter so there's no risk of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
over the counter so there's no risk of
popping<00:02:40.500> an<00:02:40.799> erection<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.400> making<00:02:41.700> her

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
popping an erection and making her

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670 
popping an erection and making her
titties<00:02:42.150> blow<00:02:42.360> their<00:02:42.569> milk<00:02:42.780> off<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.620> I'm

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
titties blow their milk off so I'm

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.050 
titties blow their milk off so I'm
handing<00:02:44.010> her<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.129> money<00:02:44.370> over<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.730> counter

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
handing her the money over the counter

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.900 
handing her the money over the counter
and<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.629> still<00:02:45.989> happens<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.680> still<00:02:47.310> happens<00:02:47.730> I

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
and it still happens it still happens I

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.759 
and it still happens it still happens I
can't<00:02:48.329> move<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.810> character<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
can't move the character and the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.089 
can't move the character and the
objective<00:02:50.250> doesn't<00:02:50.549> pop<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:51.560> now<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.799> time<00:02:53.069> I

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
objective doesn't pop up now this time I

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.280 
objective doesn't pop up now this time I
actually<00:02:53.400> did<00:02:53.640> figure<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.450> way<00:02:54.750> around<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
actually did figure out a way around the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.920 
actually did figure out a way around the
bullshit<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.010> autosave<00:02:56.970> gets<00:02:57.299> auto<00:02:57.540> saved

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
bullshit and autosave gets auto saved

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.319 
bullshit and autosave gets auto saved
after<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.650> bullshit<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.640> used<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.120> non

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
after the bullshit so I used the non

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.270 
after the bullshit so I used the non
bullshit<00:03:00.930> autosave<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.799> progressed<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
bullshit autosave and I progressed in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.979 
bullshit autosave and I progressed in
the<00:03:02.489> story<00:03:02.760> without<00:03:02.970> doing<00:03:03.480> anything<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
the story without doing anything the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.050 
the story without doing anything the
autosave<00:03:04.410> does<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.489> talk<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.879> Winston

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
autosave does it so I go talk to Winston

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.330 
autosave does it so I go talk to Winston
I<00:03:06.299> do<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.569> next<00:03:06.810> mission<00:03:07.170> after<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.890> cutscene

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I do the next mission after the cutscene

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.710 
I do the next mission after the cutscene
the<00:03:08.549> same<00:03:09.410> fucking<00:03:10.410> shit<00:03:11.099> happens<00:03:11.970> I'm<00:03:12.180> just
