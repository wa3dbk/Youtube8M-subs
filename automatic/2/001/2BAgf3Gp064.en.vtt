00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.589 
getting it all the way out you have to
go<00:03:35.099> back<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.430> exactly<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:35.969> you<00:03:36.090> started<00:03:36.450> with

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
go back to exactly what you started with

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.800 
go back to exactly what you started with
so<00:03:37.700> even<00:03:38.700> though<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.849> some<00:03:39.209> people<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.569> might

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
so even though to some people this might

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.020 
so even though to some people this might
look<00:03:40.019> like<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:40.379> blended<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:41.010> good<00:03:41.250> it's

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
look like it's blended pretty good it's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.770 
look like it's blended pretty good it's
not<00:03:42.829> polished<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.609> that's<00:03:44.819> why<00:03:45.030> we're<00:03:45.689> going

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
not polished and that's why we're going

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.409 
not polished and that's why we're going
to<00:03:45.840> go<00:03:45.930> ahead<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:47.220> right<00:03:47.459> back<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.299> we

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
to go ahead and go right back to what we

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.319 
to go ahead and go right back to what we
started<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:49.049> just<00:03:49.459> using<00:03:50.459> pretty<00:03:50.879> much<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
started with just using pretty much the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.649 
started with just using pretty much the
corner<00:03:51.810> butter<00:03:52.739> blade<00:03:53.069> maybe<00:03:53.700> half<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.060> blade

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
corner butter blade maybe half the blade

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.659 
corner butter blade maybe half the blade
but<00:03:54.840> mostly<00:03:55.169> just<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.530> corner<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:59.519> we're

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
but mostly just the corner and we're

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.369 
but mostly just the corner and we're
going<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.819> polish<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.939> get<00:04:03.090> it

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
going to polish that out just to get it

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.809 
going to polish that out just to get it
to<00:04:04.379> where<00:04:04.560> it's<00:04:04.739> nice<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:06.359> clean<00:04:06.750> how<00:04:07.680> much<00:04:07.950> it

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
to where it's nice and clean how much it

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.349 
to where it's nice and clean how much it
always<00:04:09.000> looks<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:10.189> am<00:04:11.189> going<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:12.060> way

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
always looks like I am going this way

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.199 
always looks like I am going this way
all<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.139> time<00:04:13.379> is<00:04:13.590> because<00:04:14.280> his<00:04:14.489> hair<00:04:14.730> as<00:04:15.000> it

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
all the time is because his hair as it

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.439 
all the time is because his hair as it
comes<00:04:15.389> down<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.900> goes<00:04:16.139> like<00:04:16.709> this

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
comes down it goes like this

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.089 
comes down it goes like this
so<00:04:18.449> since<00:04:18.840> I'm<00:04:18.930> cutting<00:04:19.289> against<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.859> need<00:04:20.010> to

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
so since I'm cutting against I need to

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.460 
so since I'm cutting against I need to
be<00:04:20.220> making<00:04:20.430> sure<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:21.510> I'm<00:04:21.630> always<00:04:21.810> going

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
be making sure that I'm always going

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.340 
be making sure that I'm always going
against<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.130> right
