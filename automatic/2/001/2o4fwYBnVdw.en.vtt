00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.840
 no you do not understand it suggests rust 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:40.570
 do not affect the blade 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.650
 It goes up that strengthens it, it 's legal. 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.080
 You and your mother cross reminds you of the daily 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.300
 united in the secret camera with the presence 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.280
 of a basilisk if you say too 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.090
 That's it in your little bag, is not it? 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.430
 seeing in the secret chamber you support him 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.990
 basilisk with the sword of gryffindor a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.470
 The blade is impregnated with 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.839
 basilisk with sword only absorbs conceal it 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.100

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.360
 the horcruxes 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.729

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.010
 bright and hermione serious 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.600
 in fact I'm very logical about 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.610
 allows you to see the most 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.159
 strangers, and to perceive clearly that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 others ignore it and just have a problem is 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.610
 logical 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.400
 and I'm still here, but you can 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.510
 Continue 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.420
 I do not want to be spoiler which 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.060
 It's a problem, the problem does not have a problem. 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.710

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.440

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.470
 logo set bushing 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.180

 I also thought good, sorry but I 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.700
 I could not understand which is the part that 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.140
 does not match your 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.580
 expectations 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.410

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.150
