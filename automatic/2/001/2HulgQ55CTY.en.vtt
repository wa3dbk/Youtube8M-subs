I'm digging him in here and the outsider
behind<00:01:20.050> all<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.590> don't<00:01:21.160> think<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.550> is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
behind all this I don't think this is

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.180 
behind all this I don't think this is
the<00:01:21.820> outsider<00:01:22.210> from<00:01:22.390> flashpoint<00:01:23.050> I<00:01:23.230> think<00:01:23.770> and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
the outsider from flashpoint I think and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.740 
the outsider from flashpoint I think and
that<00:01:24.340> one<00:01:24.550> was<00:01:24.700> created<00:01:25.090> by<00:01:25.210> James<00:01:25.420> Robinson

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
that one was created by James Robinson

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.200 
that one was created by James Robinson
so<00:01:26.140> maybe<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:26.710> James<00:01:27.400> Robinson<00:01:27.700> maybe<00:01:28.030> that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
so maybe I'm James Robinson maybe that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.850 
so maybe I'm James Robinson maybe that
was<00:01:28.420> something<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.900> falling-out<00:01:29.350> with<00:01:29.410> DC
