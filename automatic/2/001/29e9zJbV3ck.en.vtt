alright guys Richard from the RC network

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.419 
alright guys Richard from the RC network
and<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.590> update<00:00:11.130> number

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
and this is going to be update number

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.210 
and this is going to be update number
three<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> believe<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.380> techno<00:00:14.040> SCT<00:00:14.969> 410

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
three I believe on my techno SCT 410

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.250 
three I believe on my techno SCT 410
it's<00:00:17.220> been<00:00:17.490> probably<00:00:17.789> about<00:00:18.180> two<00:00:18.720> weeks<00:00:18.990> if

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it's been probably about two weeks if

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.679 
it's been probably about two weeks if
not<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:19.920> bit<00:00:20.130> more<00:00:20.390> since<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.510> last

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
not a little bit more since my last

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.560 
not a little bit more since my last
update<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.730> primarily<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.850> was<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.269> waiting

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
update and primarily I was just waiting

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.820 
update and primarily I was just waiting
on<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:25.439> part<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.220> arrive<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
on one part to arrive and that was that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.030 
on one part to arrive and that was that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
seen my unboxing video of that speed

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.240 
seen my unboxing video of that speed
control<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:37.980> array<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
control but this is just an array of

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
control but this is just an array of
parts<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.850> I've<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> gathered<00:00:39.719> over

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
parts that I've kind of gathered over

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.400 
parts that I've kind of gathered over
the<00:00:40.050> last<00:00:41.180> two<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> three<00:00:42.420> weeks<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.930> have

the last two to three weeks and have
kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> gathered<00:00:44.219> things<00:00:44.399> together<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.969> get

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
kind of gathered things together to get

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.000 
kind of gathered things together to get
this<00:00:45.239> truck<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> running<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.950> a

this truck up and running I do have a
couple<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> days<00:00:47.640> off<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.270> gonna<00:00:48.450> give

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
couple of days off so I'm gonna give

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.950 
couple of days off so I'm gonna give
this<00:00:48.870> thing<00:00:49.110> completely<00:00:50.600> installed<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this thing completely installed and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
this thing completely installed and
tuned<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.460> hopefully<00:00:53.820> hit<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> track

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
tuned so I can hopefully hit the track

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
tuned so I can hopefully hit the track
on<00:00:54.629> Wednesday<00:00:54.989> we'll<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.440> happens<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> I

always a great servo that's I think my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
always a great servo that's I think my
third<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.600> always<00:01:10.560> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
third one I have so always kind of go to

I<00:01:17.880> am<00:01:18.390> gonna<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.080> TLR<00:01:20.000> servo<00:01:21.000> horn

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I am gonna try out this TLR servo horn

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
I am gonna try out this TLR servo horn
it's<00:01:21.720> meant<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> 22<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.640> pretty

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it's meant for the 22 I use it pretty

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
it's meant for the 22 I use it pretty
much<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.390> my<00:01:24.540> Sox's<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.350> no<00:01:25.500> issues<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
much on all my Sox's with no issues but

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
much on all my Sox's with no issues but
I<00:01:26.729> further<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.270> issues<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.490> servo

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I further some issues with the servo

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
I further some issues with the servo
horn<00:01:29.520> rubbing<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.659> we'll<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.380> one

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
horn rubbing so we'll see if this one

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.679 
horn rubbing so we'll see if this one
works<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.820> find<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:34.130> solution<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
works if not I will find a solution for

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
proline ions MC compound and they're

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.440 
proline ions MC compound and they're
glued<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.660> some<00:02:09.899> f11<00:02:10.760> wheels<00:02:11.760> from<00:02:12.120> proline

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
glued up to some f11 wheels from proline

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.580 
glued up to some f11 wheels from proline
as<00:02:12.599> well<00:02:12.780> got
