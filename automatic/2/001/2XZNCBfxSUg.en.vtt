 The site's 6- camera galaxy camera has been 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.180

 sony sensor and others have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.890
 sensor of samsung and this 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.380
 happens at random is not 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.440
 related to a region to a batch 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.570
 or an operator for example 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.600
 this could have happened for example 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.000
 or because Sony has made available few 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.220
 sensors for samsung or because the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.830
 samsung team that will streamline manufacturing 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.320

 term and people with more eyes 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.450
 perceive differences in 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.050
 photos taken with one and another sensor 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 Are you looking at the subject now? 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.140
 rift glasses the final version of it goes 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.750
 arrive in the first quarter of 2010 16 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.560
 The rift glasses have been developed for 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.870
 years 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.450
 some developmental versions have been 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.160
 available during this period but not 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.280
 next year the reality glasses 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.830

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.280

 there for the end of the year 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.800
 ift developer was acquired by 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.019
 facebook in 2014 virtual reality is a 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.269
 really cool topic and augmented reality 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.300
 it's very cool too 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.220
 just look at the idea but will it have 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.260
 a game of terror rolling on the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.019
 kickstarter a project of a game of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.239
 terror that uses the player's house as 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.060
 environment then the idea is to put 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.480
 monsters demons and ghosts and what 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.090
 go to your room in your room anyway 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.120
 works so the player was a phone 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.330
 Hear, turn off the lights and open the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.209
 smartphone with flash attached to images 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.050
 will be projected on the screen of the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.360
 cell phone 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.640
 and then the game will control everything 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.769
 have in the house the game is called night 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.810
 terrors and it has already been confirmed that it will 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.180
 reach first for the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.669
 then to the android if the hardware 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.419
 allow it also goes to windows 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.150
 phone 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.780
 this according to the developers then the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.420
 people started talking about games going 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.290

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.389
 shoot cars 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.010
 Yes I said cars and then when those 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.889
 cars are fired 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.800
 Of course they do the damage to 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.320
 no highly destructive spirit 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.660
 also look 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.450

 People end the video of today talking about 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.810
 a serious matter that is digital security 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.050
 There is an hour that was discovered. 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.380

 was discovered by a group of 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.400
 researchers of cisco systems and this 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.830
 evil is very good to avoid being 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.750
 detected even it is capable of 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.940
 delete everything from an hd 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.700
