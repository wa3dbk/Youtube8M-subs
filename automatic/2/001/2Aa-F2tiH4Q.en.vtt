00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.590
 Now what we are going to see is how to edit 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.779
 our profile before we saw the structure 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.970
 I had but now we are going to enter more 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.369
 specifically in it for it in the menu 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.910
 top right we click on 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.800
 our name and we access the profile 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.529
 here that we will have as we said 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.570
 before a series of options we found 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.870
 on the one hand if we go over the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.180
 header image as it will appear 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 an option to change cover here what 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.140
 What we can do is change this 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.149
 head this image if for we are 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.100
 about the profile image 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.930
 we could avoid the profile picture and now 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.449
 I say so from taking a picture with 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.370
 the webcam of the computer or if we are in 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.190
 the mobile with the camera of the mobile 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.559
 choose a photo that we already have upload 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.239
 on facebook or directly upload a 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.859
 photo that we have in our computer 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.059
 then then let's see how 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 update what would be our 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.060
 information 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.620
 all the information that our 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.320
 our friends are going to see what we expel 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.780
 about updating information and here 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 we are seeing 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.940
 Well, the whole area of information that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.350
 we have from training and employment here 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.549
 so here what we will do is 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.400
 example in job training then 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.759
 we can add jobs because 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.140
 we would write the post and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.729
 we would simply give it to add or 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 we can edit the jobs 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.159
 in which we have already been for example 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 clicking on edit then we can 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.009
 associate the post and we can even 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.899
 choose who can see that 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.430
 information for example in the place in 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.720
 the one that we work for surely it is 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.390
 interesting that is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 that is public but perhaps already the place 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.920
 of residence another type of information 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.740
 then we can decide that it is or private 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 in this case it appears as public but 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.260
 let's go down and I'll put 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 cancel because we have not modified anything 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.280
 and here good simply because then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.420
 example was shown we want in the part 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.020
 of studies we can add even 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.340
 I want to say that you can 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.400
 add many options and you can 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.080
 configure then quite accurately 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.660
 then in the basic information that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.250
 I look like the date of birth 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 then in this case if I what 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.989
 I want is 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 For example, modify privacy 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.830
 let's edit 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.930
 then here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.330
 You see that this option always appears 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 where we can choose who we want 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.900
 see our search for the data that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610
 we have published in this case because the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.790
 date of birth he published I have it 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.470
 only for my friends could I even 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.600
 let him only see me or some 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.570
 users specifically then well 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 we will be able to do with everyone with 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.710
 each of the data we have in 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.540
 ours in our profile and it's very 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.840
 important this part of privacy because 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.120
 to avoid 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.480
 problems sometimes with some issues by 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.769
 example and we can even put 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.629
 Politic ideology 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.420
 maybe it's interesting that that's not what 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.140
 there can be anyone and about 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.620
 everything when looking for work 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.209
 and well what else can we do? 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.400
 here this activity registration area 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.459
 here what we are going to find is everything 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.190
 those interactions that we have had 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.680
 on facebook since or who have interacted 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.990
 with us because for example it appears 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.320
 oriol to create a list 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.940
 oriol has continued to like a link is 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.100
 say in this way we will see everything 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.110
 what all our interactions 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.720
 on facebook and so we can also 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.460
 edit if for example 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 we have put I like that we have 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.020
 wrong we want to review it here what 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.440
 we have also we can see in this 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.720
 zone for example who has interacted 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.300
 with us and they have mentioned us 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.660
 have tagged in a photo or in a 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.840
 publication and this option is important 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.670
 because we can check if we do not show 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.670
 in photographs that we do not want 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.520
 appear or appear in comments that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.400
 not that we are not interested in this way 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.010
 we can choose it myself 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.260
 How do I set up Facebook? 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.870
 in such a way that when someone 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.760
 label then I get a 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.770
 notification in the registry and you see here 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.870
 1 review of the labels appears 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.150
 Well, that means someone has 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.430
 ticket given then I here and to be able 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.800
 choose if I want to add this tag or 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.430
 I do not want it to appear on my wall if the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.830
 I ignore then directly 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.320
 it does not appear tagged in that image and 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.480
 none of my friends could see me there 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.480
 or people who are not friends of mine 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.940
 what would be profile configuration 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.570
 we would have this area that from the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.760
 options that simply allow us 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.130
 For example, this option is 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.830
 very useful that is to see how with this 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.380
 what we will achieve is to study our 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.740
 privacy to see 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.160
 how other users see us and so we can 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.380
 filter or work more the issues of 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.290
 privacy then good here in this 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.200
 case if I do not put any name then you see 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.180
 that with this is the look of your 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.389
 biography for public is to say here 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.389
 we will see 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.200
 anyone who is not my friend 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.570
 how will you see my profile 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.740
 and then we can also see it see how 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.330
 someone in particular if we click on 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.480
 this option we could put the name of 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.920
 a person and see or enter as if 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.620
 that person is to say that he will see that 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.710
 my profile person 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.900
 then now 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.130
 so we could manage our 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.130
 correctly privacy 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.219
 to
