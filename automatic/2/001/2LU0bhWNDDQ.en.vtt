today<00:00:13.059> we're<00:00:13.360> at<00:00:13.480> this<00:00:13.660> house<00:00:13.870> where<00:00:14.139> we're

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
today we're at this house where we're

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.080 
today we're at this house where we're
replacing<00:00:14.620> eleven<00:00:15.250> windows<00:00:15.580> let's<00:00:15.910> take<00:00:16.059> a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
replacing eleven windows let's take a

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.000 
replacing eleven windows let's take a
look<00:00:16.240> now<00:00:16.450> these<00:00:17.050> are<00:00:17.200> old<00:00:17.349> wood<00:00:17.590> windows

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
look now these are old wood windows

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.820 
look now these are old wood windows
there's<00:00:18.820> many<00:00:19.119> kinds<00:00:19.539> of<00:00:19.660> windows<00:00:20.050> but<00:00:20.590> this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
there's many kinds of windows but this

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.800 
there's many kinds of windows but this
is<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.070> most<00:00:21.220> common<00:00:21.610> kind<00:00:21.820> it's<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.360> double

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
is the most common kind it's a double

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.390 
is the most common kind it's a double
hung<00:00:23.020> window<00:00:23.439> let<00:00:23.890> me<00:00:23.980> show<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:24.189> another

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
hung window let me show you another

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.069 
hung window let me show you another
thing<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:25.000> could<00:00:25.119> be<00:00:25.270> done<00:00:25.450> when<00:00:25.660> we<00:00:25.810> replace

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
thing that could be done when we replace

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.440 
thing that could be done when we replace
windows<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:27.220> make<00:00:27.400> them<00:00:27.579> as<00:00:27.759> energy<00:00:28.090> efficient

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
windows to make them as energy efficient

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.999 
windows to make them as energy efficient
as<00:00:28.540> possible<00:00:28.599> here's<00:00:29.200> another<00:00:29.470> little<00:00:29.710> trick

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
as possible here's another little trick

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
as possible here's another little trick
and<00:00:30.160> this<00:00:30.399> is<00:00:30.669> I<00:00:31.000> can<00:00:31.540> guarantee<00:00:31.899> you<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:32.140> no

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and this is I can guarantee you that no

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.150 
and this is I can guarantee you that no
replacement<00:00:34.540> window<00:00:34.780> companies<00:00:35.230> do<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:35.860> but

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
replacement window companies do this but

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.209 
replacement window companies do this but
that<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.730> try<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.260> seal<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.530> shim<00:00:38.860> space

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
that is to try to seal the shim space

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.639 
that is to try to seal the shim space
between<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.879> existing<00:00:40.450> window<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.140> the

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
between the existing window and the

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.450 
between the existing window and the
framed<00:00:42.340> opening<00:00:42.820> what<00:00:43.390> we<00:00:43.510> can<00:00:43.690> do<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.429> drill<00:00:45.429> a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
framed opening what we can do is drill a

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.599 
framed opening what we can do is drill a
hole<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:46.449> and<00:00:46.780> we<00:00:47.469> have<00:00:47.649> our<00:00:47.679> foam<00:00:48.100> gun<00:00:48.339> with

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
hole here and we have our foam gun with

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.759 
hole here and we have our foam gun with
a<00:00:48.640> needle<00:00:48.999> when<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.449> pull<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.899> trigger<00:00:49.929> this

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
a needle when I pull the trigger this

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.520 
a needle when I pull the trigger this
foam<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.129> coming<00:00:51.579> out<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.820> gun<00:00:51.999> like<00:00:52.210> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
foam is coming out of the gun like that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.889 
foam is coming out of the gun like that
and<00:00:53.530> we<00:00:53.679> stick<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.129> there<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:55.480> pulling<00:00:55.839> the

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
and we stick it in there I'm pulling the

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.380 
and we stick it in there I'm pulling the
trigger<00:00:55.929> right<00:00:56.409> now<00:00:56.559> all<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:56.859> foam<00:00:57.249> is<00:00:57.999> going

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
trigger right now all that foam is going

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.270 
trigger right now all that foam is going
into<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.629> shim<00:00:59.019> space<00:00:59.319> what<00:00:59.859> is<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.129> gonna

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
into that shim space what is that gonna

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.340 
into that shim space what is that gonna
do<00:01:00.489> for<00:01:00.519> us<00:01:00.730> well<00:01:00.999> it's<00:01:01.600> gonna<00:01:01.719> prevent<00:01:02.050> cold

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
do for us well it's gonna prevent cold

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.130 
do for us well it's gonna prevent cold
air<00:01:02.530> from<00:01:02.710> coming<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:03.269> around<00:01:04.269> this<00:01:04.510> casing

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
air from coming in around this casing

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.500 
air from coming in around this casing
here<00:01:05.500> or<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:08.430> stop<00:01:09.430> air<00:01:09.880> flow<00:01:10.210> and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
here or here and stop air flow and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.420 
here or here and stop air flow and
that's<00:01:10.900> very<00:01:11.229> important<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:11.979> won't<00:01:12.250> get

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
that's very important but you won't get

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.730 
that's very important but you won't get
that<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:13.060> any<00:01:13.090> standard<00:01:13.740> replacement

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
that with any standard replacement

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.530 
that with any standard replacement
window<00:01:15.010> service<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.640> an<00:01:15.850> extra<00:01:16.210> step

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
window service this is an extra step

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.230 
window service this is an extra step
that<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:17.200> go<00:01:17.380> through<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:17.920> ensure<00:01:18.040> that<00:01:18.670> these

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
that we go through to ensure that these

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.819 
that we go through to ensure that these
windows<00:01:19.630> are<00:01:19.810> as<00:01:19.960> energy<00:01:20.350> efficient<00:01:20.740> as

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
windows are as energy efficient as

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.530 
windows are as energy efficient as
possible<00:01:20.920> okay<00:01:21.790> well<00:01:21.969> let's<00:01:22.119> take<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.299> look<00:01:22.479> at

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
possible okay well let's take a look at

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.300 
possible okay well let's take a look at
these<00:01:22.630> new<00:01:22.869> windows<00:01:23.320> these<00:01:23.560> new<00:01:23.770> windows<00:01:24.130> are

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
these new windows these new windows are

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.709 
these new windows these new windows are
more<00:01:24.579> energy<00:01:25.000> efficient<00:01:25.420> than<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.689> old

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
more energy efficient than the old

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.420 
more energy efficient than the old
windows<00:01:26.320> that's<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.710> reason<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.100> replace

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
windows that's the reason to replace

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.469 
windows that's the reason to replace
them<00:01:27.610> in<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.789> first<00:01:28.000> place

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
them in the first place

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.740 
them in the first place
first<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.079> all<00:01:29.170> we<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:30.210> double<00:01:31.210> glazing<00:01:31.450> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
first of all we have double glazing and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.450 
first of all we have double glazing and
double<00:01:32.409> glazing<00:01:32.619> two<00:01:32.920> pieces<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.280> glass

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
double glazing two pieces of glass

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.660 
double glazing two pieces of glass
provides<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.390> space<00:01:34.780> between<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.500> glass<00:01:35.770> so

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
provides a space between the glass so

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.300 
provides a space between the glass so
that<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:38.229> don't<00:01:38.469> get<00:01:38.619> as<00:01:38.799> much<00:01:38.950> heat

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
that we don't get as much heat

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.179 
that we don't get as much heat
transmittance<00:01:40.119> through<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:41.350> glass<00:01:41.770> itself

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
transmittance through the glass itself

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.279 
transmittance through the glass itself
we<00:01:42.430> also<00:01:42.460> have<00:01:42.759> low<00:01:43.000> E<00:01:43.030> glass<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.079> very

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
we also have low E glass this is very

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.649 
we also have low E glass this is very
important<00:01:44.799> low<00:01:45.070> E<00:01:45.100> glass<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.909> low<00:01:46.149> emissivity

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
important low E glass is low emissivity

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.520 
important low E glass is low emissivity
and<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:48.340> means<00:01:48.609> that<00:01:48.969> we<00:01:49.359> can<00:01:49.570> let<00:01:49.780> visible

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
and that means that we can let visible

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.039 
and that means that we can let visible
light<00:01:50.740> through<00:01:51.130> but<00:01:51.789> we're<00:01:52.000> gonna<00:01:52.149> block<00:01:52.630> a

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
light through but we're gonna block a

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.459 
light through but we're gonna block a
large<00:01:53.890> portion<00:01:54.579> of<00:01:54.609> the<00:01:55.270> part<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.229> light

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
large portion of the part of the light

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.649 
large portion of the part of the light
spectrum<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:57.280> carries<00:01:57.700> heat<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.149> radiates

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
spectrum that carries heat that radiates

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.459 
spectrum that carries heat that radiates
heat<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.320> low<00:01:59.649> E<00:01:59.679> glass<00:01:59.920> prevents<00:02:00.850> heat<00:02:01.060> flow

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
heat so low E glass prevents heat flow

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.289 
heat so low E glass prevents heat flow
from<00:02:02.469> the<00:02:02.890> outside<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.549> in<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.789> summer<00:02:04.030> and
