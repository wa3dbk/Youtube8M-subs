the myths that are out there and he
dispelled<00:01:05.110> them<00:01:05.350> because<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:06.490> me<00:01:06.610> it's<00:01:06.820> very

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
dispelled them because to me it's very

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.180 
dispelled them because to me it's very
focused<00:01:07.450> for<00:01:07.780> women<00:01:08.290> because<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> lot<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
focused for women because a lot of the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.790 
focused for women because a lot of the
misconceptions<00:01:09.340> are<00:01:10.090> geared<00:01:10.330> towards<00:01:10.600> women
