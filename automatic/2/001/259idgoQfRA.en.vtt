00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:04.280
 si 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 Rent 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 Reason enough a successful debut reason they have 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 Madrid 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.749
 we hear 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.720
 welcome to 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.540
 Life with Piel 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.200
 Today I really got myself into a shell 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.109
 to them 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.530
 Theme to introduce the bands clothes 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.080
 I wear on which occasion 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.630
 I personally feel that way 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.560
 especially if not so special 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 Events or officially invited the bands I feel 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040
 was clearly safe 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.090
 be dressed appropriately 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 but what is appropriate 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.990
 Today I have invited a colleague with whom I have the pleasure 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 I have also been married for 8 years 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 the Lola when Klack Klack stands on the invitation card 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.210
 what does the host wish for? 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.659
 this is the opportunity to fetch mocks on the closet 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.500
 outdoors during the day 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.120
 could also be that the Nati ca 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.650
 suitable for this 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.680
 corresponding 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.800
 a shirt in Beijing 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.980
 she caught up with the famous canon and, of course, beaming in fun 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.300
 looks gay black stockings 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.850
 like the name TOC 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.240
 a black bow 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.980
 it could also strike a monochrome 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.730
 and the farther to a window in the same color the cummerbund 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 Now, as a rule, there is nothing on the invitation cards Vastic 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.609
 Lady should wear 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.829
 what would you do in the 4th 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.879
 on the part of the Amet is stirring evening gown 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.990
 but that fights without evening dress 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.380
 it could also be shorter Norbert Dickel still a long evening dress 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.969
 and to rule that, of course, really nice 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.249
 a beautiful jewelry 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.449
 Earrings 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.469
 Eppstein Collins 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.499
 a hinge could also be the applause 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.289
 there a cape 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.019
 because of course the shoes fit 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.019
 Vettel from the material of the dress or simply 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.889
 The schools coordinate festive schools 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.459
 then, of course, the little bag not to forget the small 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.789
 evening Bags 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.789
 that makes a total of 1/2 percent 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.559
 the top variation on the invitation cards is a broad part 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.559
 sometimes big business suits as well 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.310
 of course, it is no longer farm nowadays 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.989
 her post before us 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.189
 reserved at the start shops or maybe on the racetrack could 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.509
 during the day, for example, the category clubs or also called cath 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.189
 as a revenue of life has the front 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.669
 is rounded off 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.539
 and you carry child with many thanks 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:38.580
 what do you want for the Opera Ball in the 4th 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.809
 for example for the Vienna Opera Ball 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.809
 more wonderful to come now 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:47.739
 committed at most 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739
 Garments women's film festival is enough 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.339
 Practitioner in front short 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.439
 Steinert and just read the bottom of the bottom 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.409
 write Wendel 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.659
 Pack 2 a matching facts and also the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.070
 and of course 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.289
 the cylinder 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.539
 and on top of that, and then it slides a bit too 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.549
 be more voluminous 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.230
 now the evening gown can do a little something 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.779
 more stuff 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.789
 to have 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.069
 maybe also the jewelry 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.509
 precious 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.870
 Premiere on 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.520
 and the school finishing club of course, all the other queried 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.309
 for the evening dress 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.050
 this June 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.830
 mam 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830
 the 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.689
 but not only 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.979
 maybe go out for a cocktail at the hotel and when he swims 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.180
 was then what to do 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.889
 Of course, this is an event probably no fixed 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.930
 by 12 4 percent and small business PÃ©tanque Red 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.840
 Percent residual value wants 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.360
 but it is nice if a little more help 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.090
 There is a strong name in it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.029
 for example 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:08.439
 a super human wearing a maybe also cereal took off with Peter Klocker 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.710
 Bayer eleven 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.520
 Jan the canceling clicks her projects top-talents comes to where or 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.730
 but maybe even a little black or cocktail dress would be there 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.710
 and thus gives it a very special touch after this event 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.460
 invite you to a festive evening 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.759
 sometimes the dress code dark suit 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.740
 from what does the host expect from the lady and the gentleman 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.550
 in this case 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.479
 Wear a dark blue or black suit to fit shirt and 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.659
 a festive character 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.659
 and thick arms according to a costume 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.119
 the opponent will dress code Network the clothing style of the lady 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.119
 and the pardon of Mr. the three-piece suit 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.319
 Or we can wear a pantsuit 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.949
 and to give the whole a festive setting that can also be found in 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.539
 Go direction of a small states 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.610
 but overall, just stay clean and stay simple 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:37.270
