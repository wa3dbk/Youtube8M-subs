00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hi guys welcome to the m9 pistol guide

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.129 
hi guys welcome to the m9 pistol guide
for<00:00:08.099> normal<00:00:08.429> mode<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.880> really<00:00:09.480> like<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.840> m9

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
for normal mode I really like the m9

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.799 
for normal mode I really like the m9
pistol<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:11.219> great<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.910> does<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.660> much

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
pistol it's really great it does so much

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.539 
pistol it's really great it does so much
damage<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:13.830> fast<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
damage it's really fast it's got a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.939 
damage it's really fast it's got a
decent<00:00:14.759> clip<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.750> time<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> kill<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.650> pretty

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
decent clip it's time to kill is pretty

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.460 
decent clip it's time to kill is pretty
low<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.810> take<00:00:19.289> on

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
low and you can actually take on

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
low and you can actually take on
multiple<00:00:19.680> opponents<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.550> think<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.240> pistol

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
multiple opponents I think this pistol

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
multiple opponents I think this pistol
compared<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> most<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> other<00:00:22.800> pistols<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
compared to most the other pistols it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.660 
compared to most the other pistols it
just<00:00:24.090> outshines<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.930> completely<00:00:25.410> maybe<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
just outshines them completely maybe it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029 
just outshines them completely maybe it
doesn't<00:00:27.119> even<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.869> could<00:00:28.109> even<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.380> possibly

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
doesn't even it could even be possibly

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.040 
doesn't even it could even be possibly
the<00:00:29.189> best<00:00:29.369> pistol<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.970> normal<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.750> doesn't

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the best pistol in normal it doesn't

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
the best pistol in normal it doesn't
even<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> run<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.859> its<00:00:31.980> money<00:00:32.040> yet<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
even have a run for its money yet that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.450 
even have a run for its money yet that
I've<00:00:32.730> gone<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> g18<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.890> honestly

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I've gone up to the g18 and I honestly

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
I've gone up to the g18 and I honestly
think<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> m9<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> best<00:00:37.290> one

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
think the m9 here is just the best one

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
think the m9 here is just the best one
by<00:00:37.710> far<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> go

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
by far so probably going to have to go

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
by far so probably going to have to go
all<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> 93<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.590> maybe<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
all the way to 93 are maybe or even the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
all the way to 93 are maybe or even the
compact<00:00:42.360> 45<00:00:42.719> before<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> pistol

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
compact 45 before you get to a pistol

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
compact 45 before you get to a pistol
that<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.730> even<00:00:44.879> comes<00:00:45.420> close<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.289> m9

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that I think even comes close to this m9

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
that I think even comes close to this m9
this<00:00:47.340> pistol<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.300> great<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
this pistol is just great all around and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
this pistol is just great all around and
it's<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.070> cool<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.340> i<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's really cool because i think is the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's really cool because i think is the
second<00:00:51.690> pistol<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> unlock<00:00:52.590> i<00:00:52.890> think

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
second pistol that you unlock i think

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.950 
second pistol that you unlock i think
it's<00:00:53.489> better<00:00:53.610> than<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.000> pistol<00:00:54.660> simply

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it's better than the first pistol simply

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's better than the first pistol simply
because<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> bullets<00:00:56.010> fly<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.789> bit

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
because the bullets fly a little bit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
because the bullets fly a little bit
faster<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.719> i<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.829> bit

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
faster and i think they go a little bit

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.029 
faster and i think they go a little bit
further<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.629> other<00:01:00.840> pistol<00:01:01.289> has<00:01:01.500> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
further so the other pistol has like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030 
further so the other pistol has like
slightly<00:01:03.000> faster<00:01:03.210> reload<00:01:03.719> time<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.559> obviously

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
slightly faster reload time so obviously

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
slightly faster reload time so obviously
this<00:01:05.220> pistol<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> letter<00:01:06.750> pistol<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this pistol is just the letter pistol in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710 
this pistol is just the letter pistol in
most<00:01:07.500> scenarios<00:01:07.680> i<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.540> good

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
most scenarios i think it's really good

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
most scenarios i think it's really good
because<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.530> damage<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.220> does<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:12.450> can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because of that damage it does you can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
because of that damage it does you can
kind<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> kill<00:01:13.200> people<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> injured<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.010> one

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
kind of kill people that injured in one

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.890 
kind of kill people that injured in one
or<00:01:14.310> two<00:01:14.340> shots<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.390> engage<00:01:15.509> multiple

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
or two shots you can engage multiple

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.320 
or two shots you can engage multiple
targets<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.700> i<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
targets because of this but i think a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.160 
targets because of this but i think a
real<00:01:18.570> drawback<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:20.390> passed<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.750> little

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
real drawback of this is passed a little

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.859 
real drawback of this is passed a little
bit<00:01:22.320> close<00:01:22.710> quarters<00:01:23.189> maybe<00:01:23.520> 20<00:01:24.030> 30<00:01:24.270> meters<00:01:24.689> or

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
bit close quarters maybe 20 30 meters or

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
bit close quarters maybe 20 30 meters or
so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> huge<00:01:26.670> drop-off<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so you really see a huge drop-off in the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
so you really see a huge drop-off in the
ability<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> kill<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.439> pistol<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
ability to kill this pistol because you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
ability to kill this pistol because you
have<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> hit<00:01:30.060> people<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.570> four<00:01:30.900> or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
have you got to hit people like four or

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
have you got to hit people like four or
five<00:01:30.990> times<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.579> becomes<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
five times and it just becomes so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
five times and it just becomes so
difficult<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> recoil

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
difficult to do because of the recoil

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.219 
difficult to do because of the recoil
it's<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.790> useful<00:01:36.299> pistol<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> any

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
it's not a useful pistol at all and any

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's not a useful pistol at all and any
more<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.530> range<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
more at this range so you have to have a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.420 
more at this range so you have to have a
close<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.750> personal<00:01:40.680> encounter<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
close up personal encounter with this

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
close up personal encounter with this
pasol<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.240> able<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
pasol if you want to be able to use it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
pasol if you want to be able to use it
effectively<00:01:44.960> now<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.700> amount<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.000> times

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
effectively now for the amount of times

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.539 
effectively now for the amount of times
you<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> hit<00:01:48.659> people<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.250> great

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
you have to hit people it's not so great

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
you have to hit people it's not so great
it<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> handle<00:01:51.299> maybe<00:01:51.659> two<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:51.990> three<00:01:52.170> people

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it can handle maybe two or three people

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
it can handle maybe two or three people
other<00:01:53.040> than<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:55.049> doesn't<00:01:55.759> do

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
other than that it really doesn't do

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
other than that it really doesn't do
much<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.020> maybe<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.710> four<00:01:58.950> people

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
much more you can maybe get four people

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
much more you can maybe get four people
and<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.939> some<00:02:00.119> head<00:02:00.299> shots<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.719> maybe<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and get some head shots in maybe you can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.719 
and get some head shots in maybe you can
wipe<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.740> people<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> most

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
wipe some people out but for the most

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
wipe some people out but for the most
part<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.450> usually<00:02:03.750> limited<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
part it's usually limited to about a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.580 
part it's usually limited to about a
solid<00:02:04.979> two<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:06.509> push<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> third

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
solid two and maybe push it to a third

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.630 
solid two and maybe push it to a third
person

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
person

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.580 
person
if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.240> get<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> know<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> headshot<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.410> or

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
if you can get you know a headshot in or

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.820 
if you can get you know a headshot in or
some<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.310> maybe<00:02:11.490> if<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.730> were<00:02:11.790> injured<00:02:12.830> but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
some or maybe if they were injured but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.699 
some or maybe if they were injured but
for<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> most<00:02:15.060> part<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.630> can<00:02:16.230> handle<00:02:16.380> most

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
for the most part it can handle most

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.090 
for the most part it can handle most
scenarios<00:02:17.569> but<00:02:18.569> because<00:02:18.930> does<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.040> does

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
scenarios but because does that it does

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.160 
scenarios but because does that it does
require<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.700> many<00:02:20.790> hits<00:02:21.060> sometimes<00:02:21.959> people

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
require so many hits sometimes people

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.670 
require so many hits sometimes people
can<00:02:22.740> help<00:02:22.950> snipe<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.500> out

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
can help snipe you and they can just out

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.410 
can help snipe you and they can just out
one<00:02:25.980> or<00:02:26.250> two<00:02:26.430> shot<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.000> some<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
one or two shot you with some of the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.290 
one or two shot you with some of the
other<00:02:27.450> weapons<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> got<00:02:31.380> its

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
other weapons so it's kind of got its

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.520 
other weapons so it's kind of got its
trade<00:02:33.300> off<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> guess<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.350> still

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
trade off so I guess but it's still

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
trade off so I guess but it's still
better<00:02:34.739> than<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.070> lot<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> other<00:02:35.730> pistols

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
better than a lot of the other pistols

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.290 
better than a lot of the other pistols
the<00:02:36.630> piss<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:36.930> completely<00:02:37.739> suck<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:39.180> this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
the piss is completely suck I think this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.430 
the piss is completely suck I think this
is<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> piston<00:02:39.750> you're<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.080> want<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.410> be

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
is a piston you're going to want to be

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.310 
is a piston you're going to want to be
using<00:02:40.800> for<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.790> majority<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.480> time<00:02:42.510> at

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
using for the majority of your time at

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.870 
using for the majority of your time at
least<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.709> normal<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.220> might<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.459> different<00:02:44.670> in

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
least in normal it might be different in

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.300 
least in normal it might be different in
the<00:02:44.940> hardcore<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.080> think<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.500> normal<00:02:46.890> you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the hardcore but I think in normal you

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.550 
the hardcore but I think in normal you
need<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.820> speed<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.810> damage<00:02:49.320> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
need the speed you need the damage and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.949 
need the speed you need the damage and
you<00:02:50.070> need<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> clip<00:02:50.700> size<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.570> be<00:02:51.690> able<00:02:51.720> to

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
you need the clip size to be able to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.280 
you need the clip size to be able to
engage<00:02:52.080> multiple<00:02:52.500> people

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.059 

see<00:02:58.890> here<00:02:59.099> it's<00:02:59.219> got<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.400> pretty<00:02:59.700> good<00:02:59.939> hip<00:03:00.239> fire

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
see here it's got a pretty good hip fire

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.220 
see here it's got a pretty good hip fire
going<00:03:02.069> it's<00:03:03.060> hard<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.299> kill<00:03:03.510> multiple<00:03:03.689> people

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
going it's hard to kill multiple people

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.809 
going it's hard to kill multiple people
especially<00:03:04.829> if<00:03:05.099> you're<00:03:05.219> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> move<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.790> lot

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
especially if you're on the move a lot

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.420 
especially if you're on the move a lot
because<00:03:06.719> you<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.890> hit<00:03:07.980> them<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.340> many

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
because you have to hit them so many

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.690 
because you have to hit them so many
times<00:03:09.049> so<00:03:10.049> if<00:03:10.379> you<00:03:10.439> can<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.829> try<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.250> stand<00:03:11.519> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
times so if you can you try and stand a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.099 
times so if you can you try and stand a
little<00:03:11.819> bit<00:03:12.060> Stiller<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.519> but<00:03:15.109> doesn't

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
little bit Stiller with this but doesn't

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.039 
little bit Stiller with this but doesn't
always<00:03:16.439> work<00:03:16.879> if<00:03:17.879> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.030> come<00:03:18.329> come<00:03:18.780> up<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.019> a

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
always work if you can come come up on a

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.140 
always work if you can come come up on a
group<00:03:19.290> that's<00:03:19.439> unaware<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.159> you<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.849> pump

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
group that's unaware of you you can pump

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.960 
group that's unaware of you you can pump
the<00:03:21.269> whole<00:03:21.569> full<00:03:21.870> 16<00:03:22.470> rounds<00:03:23.250> into<00:03:23.430> them<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the whole full 16 rounds into them and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.679 
the whole full 16 rounds into them and
it's<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.500> rip<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.859> apart<00:03:26.659> so<00:03:27.659> you

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
it's just going to rip them apart so you

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.089 
it's just going to rip them apart so you
can<00:03:27.750> aim<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.139> full<00:03:28.349> accuracy<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:28.920> this

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
can aim with the full accuracy of this

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.940 
can aim with the full accuracy of this
gun<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.849> then<00:03:30.629> it's<00:03:31.200> just<00:03:31.700> just<00:03:32.700> great<00:03:33.950> so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
gun and then it's just just great so

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.129 
gun and then it's just just great so
personally<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> recommend<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.090> m9<00:03:36.480> for<00:03:36.780> normal

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
personally I recommend the m9 for normal

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.990 
personally I recommend the m9 for normal
this<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.099> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> be<00:03:38.459> one<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.760> best

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
this is going to be one of the best

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.960 
this is going to be one of the best
pistols<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.569> think<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.439> entire<00:03:40.970> arsenal

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
pistols I think in the entire arsenal
