00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hey guys today I want to show you how to

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.760 
hey guys today I want to show you how to

now<00:01:36.840> when<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.290> changing<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.220> have

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
now when you're changing them you have

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
now when you're changing them you have
to<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.850> sure<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.110> careful<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to make sure you have to be careful of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
to make sure you have to be careful of
not<00:01:41.040> overclock<00:01:41.790> over<00:01:42.630> overclocking<00:01:44.720> because

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
not overclock over overclocking because

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.190 
not overclock over overclocking because
that<00:01:46.050> will<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.380> bad<00:01:47.310> bad<00:01:47.700> problems<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.660> if

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that will make bad bad problems like if

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.400 
that will make bad bad problems like if
I<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.830> at<00:01:50.100> 8:40<00:01:50.940> like<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.990> yet<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
I put this at 8:40 like right yet to the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.670 
I put this at 8:40 like right yet to the
maximum<00:01:53.420> there's<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.050> boxes

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
maximum there's like these little boxes

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.090 
maximum there's like these little boxes
and<00:01:55.710> black<00:01:56.700> boxes<00:01:57.360> everywhere<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.100> your

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and black boxes everywhere and your

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
and black boxes everywhere and your
computer<00:01:59.550> starts<00:01:59.820> freezing<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.420> stuff<00:02:00.630> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
computer starts freezing up and stuff so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
computer starts freezing up and stuff so
that's<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.679> 800<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.060> memory

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that's not good so 800 for the memory

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
that's not good so 800 for the memory
clock<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.649> been<00:02:05.100> working<00:02:05.460> perfect

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
clock would be it's been working perfect

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.180 
clock would be it's been working perfect
for<00:02:05.970> me<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.300> that

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
for me for that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.620 
for me for that
so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.250> guess<00:02:08.869> 800<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> graphics

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
so I guess 800 and then for the graphics

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.510 
so I guess 800 and then for the graphics
clock<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.470> processor<00:02:14.040> clock<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.459> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
clock the processor clock and the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.059 
clock the processor clock and the
graphics<00:02:14.880> graphics<00:02:15.630> clock<00:02:16.230> they're<00:02:16.590> combined

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
graphics graphics clock they're combined

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.100 
graphics graphics clock they're combined
like<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.970> move<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.330> processor<00:02:18.870> clock

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like if you move the processor clock

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.160 
like if you move the processor clock
roughish<00:02:20.040> clock<00:02:20.370> moves<00:02:20.700> also<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
roughish clock moves also so for the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.420 
roughish clock moves also so for the
processor<00:02:22.709> clock<00:02:23.240> 2000<00:02:24.680> megahertz<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
processor clock 2000 megahertz is the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.410 
processor clock 2000 megahertz is the
safe<00:02:26.700> zone<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.270> me<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:28.350> around<00:02:29.240> 2200<00:02:30.240> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
safe zone for me now around 2200 you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.330 
safe zone for me now around 2200 you
start<00:02:30.780> getting<00:02:31.110> black<00:02:31.290> boxes<00:02:31.800> again<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.250> your

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
start getting black boxes again in your

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
start getting black boxes again in your
computer<00:02:32.850> says<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.750> critical<00:02:34.170> errors<00:02:34.500> within

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
computer says is critical errors within

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.760 
computer says is critical errors within
stuff<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:36.200> make<00:02:37.200> sure<00:02:37.380> nothing's<00:02:37.709> wrong

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
stuff to like make sure nothing's wrong

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.660 
stuff to like make sure nothing's wrong
so<00:02:38.840> 2000<00:02:39.840> megahertz<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.410> fine<00:02:40.920> now<00:02:41.340> when

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so 2000 megahertz is fine now when

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.760 
so 2000 megahertz is fine now when
you're<00:02:41.819> when<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.209> hit<00:02:42.360> apply<00:02:42.599> you'll<00:02:43.260> notice

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
you're when you hit apply you'll notice

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.080 
you're when you hit apply you'll notice
that<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.910> graphics<00:02:45.660> clock<00:02:46.020> will<00:02:46.530> move<00:02:46.740> also

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
that the graphics clock will move also

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.480 
that the graphics clock will move also
with<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.240> processor<00:02:48.810> clock<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:50.099> changed

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
with the processor clock and it changed

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.050 
with the processor clock and it changed
to<00:02:50.640> 1000<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:53.099> flashing<00:02:53.550> right<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:53.910> is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
to 1000 and the flashing right there is

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.900 
to 1000 and the flashing right there is
normal<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.830> when<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.190> overclocking<00:02:56.580> you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
normal now when you're overclocking you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.430 
normal now when you're overclocking you
have<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.209> remember<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.750> it's<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.319> get

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
have to remember that it's going to get

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.850 
have to remember that it's going to get
hot<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.220> exploit<00:02:59.760> more<00:03:00.180> than<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
hot in there exploit more than the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.460 
hot in there exploit more than the
graphics<00:03:01.860> card<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.280> used<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.750> can

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
graphics card is used to so you can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.569 
graphics card is used to so you can
press<00:03:04.890> manual

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
press manual

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.429

I mean automatic control but manual

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.550 
I mean automatic control but manual
control<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.480> make<00:03:09.659> sure<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.409> not

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
control you can make sure that it's not

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.150 
control you can make sure that it's not
going<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.890> over

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
going to over

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.910 
going to over
heat<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.580> damage<00:03:11.730> your<00:03:12.000> computer<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.900> mean<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
card or anything so you could like have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.940 
card or anything so you could like have
it<00:03:17.340> 100%<00:03:17.940> when<00:03:18.330> you're<00:03:18.450> playing<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.950> overly

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it 100% when you're playing like overly

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.750 
it 100% when you're playing like overly
like<00:03:21.020> graphics<00:03:22.020> hogging<00:03:22.470> game<00:03:22.710> you<00:03:23.610> know

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
like graphics hogging game you know

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.910 
like graphics hogging game you know
since<00:03:24.150> you're<00:03:24.330> overclocking<00:03:25.020> anyways<00:03:25.650> it's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
since you're overclocking anyways it's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.510 
since you're overclocking anyways it's
going<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.160> make<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.300> even<00:03:27.420> hotter<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.370> min<00:03:29.370> your

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
going to make it even hotter so min your

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.160 
going to make it even hotter so min your
control<00:03:29.880> or<00:03:30.090> automatic<00:03:30.570> control<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.080> that's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
control or automatic control and that's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.840 
control or automatic control and that's
basically<00:03:31.830> how<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.100> do<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.370> now<00:03:32.520> when<00:03:32.730> you

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
basically how you do it now when you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.350 
basically how you do it now when you
close<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.750> will<00:03:34.200> ask<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.850> would<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:36.030> to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
close it will ask you would you like to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.790 
close it will ask you would you like to
load<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.660> save<00:03:36.840> settings<00:03:37.110> at<00:03:37.530> windows

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
load the save settings at windows

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
load the save settings at windows
startup<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:39.120> met<00:03:39.270> one<00:03:39.390> person<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.750> know<00:03:39.810> just
