don't<00:00:31.740> particularly<00:00:32.450> recommend<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> for

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
don't particularly recommend it for

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.869 
don't particularly recommend it for
ladies<00:00:35.010> who<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.219> bother<00:00:35.940> hair<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:37.579> just<00:00:38.579> think

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ladies who have bother hair I just think

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
ladies who have bother hair I just think
that<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.870> longer<00:00:40.140> hair<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.710> might

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that if you have longer hair it might

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
that if you have longer hair it might
there<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:41.850> too<00:00:42.180> much<00:00:42.210> hair<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> fit<00:00:43.230> into

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
there might be too much hair to fit into

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
there might be too much hair to fit into
this<00:00:43.980> spiral<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.809> really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this spiral and that can be really

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
this spiral and that can be really
frustrating<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.579> result<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
frustrating for you and result in

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.479 
frustrating for you and result in
tangles<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.020> nobody<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.590> wants<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
tangles and nobody really wants that I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
tangles and nobody really wants that I
think<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.960> armpit<00:00:52.500> left<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
think that if your armpit left and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
think that if your armpit left and
beyond<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.000> you're<00:00:54.660> bunning<00:00:54.899> purposes

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
beyond I think you're bunning purposes

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
beyond I think you're bunning purposes
would<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> better<00:00:55.949> served<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> spin<00:00:57.059> pin<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
would be better served by a spin pin but

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
would be better served by a spin pin but
I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.649> short<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.160> love<00:00:59.340> or

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I think that if you're short in love or

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.860 
I think that if you're short in love or
neck<00:01:00.210> length<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.030> spiral<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.629> be

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
neck length I think that spiral would be

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
neck length I think that spiral would be
the<00:01:04.409> better<00:01:04.650> option<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.670> cure<00:01:05.909> your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the better option for you just cure your

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.920 
the better option for you just cure your
fun<00:01:07.250> just<00:01:08.250> briefly<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.659> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
fun just briefly on how to use it it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
fun just briefly on how to use it it's
really<00:01:10.680> being<00:01:10.799> super<00:01:11.400> duper<00:01:11.640> easy<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.000> use

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

I just think if it was just better
overall<00:02:40.440> for<00:02:41.440> those<00:02:42.040> money<00:02:42.340> but<00:02:43.030> anyway

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
overall for those money but anyway

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.540 
overall for those money but anyway
