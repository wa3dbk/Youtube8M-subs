00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
through the locks today was certainly an

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.690 
through the locks today was certainly an
interesting<00:01:43.800> experience<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.150> say<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
interesting experience as I say it was a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.610 
interesting experience as I say it was a
windy<00:01:47.700> morning<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.210> begin<00:01:48.330> with<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.290> pretty

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
windy morning to begin with and a pretty

windy morning to begin with and a pretty
windy<00:01:50.070> night<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.720> bottom<00:01:52.050> side<00:01:52.230> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
windy night but on the bottom side of

windy night but on the bottom side of
the<00:01:52.530> locks<00:01:52.770> where<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:53.070> started<00:01:53.430> off<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.909> wasn't

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
the locks where I started off it wasn't

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.930 
the locks where I started off it wasn't
too<00:01:54.600> bad<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.680> Venus<00:01:56.190> windy<00:01:56.580> as<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
too bad if I Venus windy as it was on

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.820 
too bad if I Venus windy as it was on
the<00:01:57.240> top<00:01:57.450> side<00:01:57.659> locks<00:01:58.080> there's<00:01:58.409> no<00:01:58.620> way<00:01:58.800> I

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the top side locks there's no way I

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.130 
the top side locks there's no way I
would<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.130> ever<00:01:59.400> travelled<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.810> I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
would have ever travelled but I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.170 
would have ever travelled but I'm
certainly<00:02:01.680> glad<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> did<00:02:02.580> just<00:02:03.000> because

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
