00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
could also use an exacto blade but we

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.370 
could also use an exacto blade but we
already<00:03:42.730> showed<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.450> we<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.660> narrowed

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380

we also pre clean this area with
isopropyl<00:03:50.860> rubbing<00:03:51.400> alcohol<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.360> it's<00:03:53.200> dried

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.470 
would what we're going to do is take
make<00:04:19.450> sure<00:04:19.480> it's<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.780> dry<00:04:19.989> erase<00:04:20.110> marker<00:04:21.480> what

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
make sure it's a dry erase marker what

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.880 
make sure it's a dry erase marker what
we're<00:04:22.600> going<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.750> do<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.080> just<00:04:23.230> mark<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
we're going to do is just mark the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.220 
we're going to do is just mark the
corners<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.970> where<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.390> factory<00:04:25.780> emblem<00:04:26.050> was

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
corners of where the factory emblem was

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.590 
corners of where the factory emblem was
so<00:04:26.770> we<00:04:27.040> can<00:04:27.220> correctly<00:04:27.760> position<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.270> new<00:04:28.450> hat

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
so we can correctly position the new hat

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.450 
so we can correctly position the new hat
bump<00:04:28.810> point<00:04:29.080> in<00:04:29.200> installation<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.190> I'm<00:04:30.310> just

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
bump point in installation so I'm just

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.270 
bump point in installation so I'm just
going<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.700> do<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:30.970> mark<00:04:31.240> right<00:04:31.480> there

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.480 

and<00:04:37.200> just<00:04:38.200> use<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.470> same<00:04:38.680> side<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.130> marker

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
and just use the same side of the marker

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.790 
and just use the same side of the marker
to<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:39.910> some<00:04:40.060> markers<00:04:40.420> or<00:04:40.570> chisel<00:04:40.780> so<00:04:41.680> you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
to get some markers or chisel so you

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.180 
to get some markers or chisel so you
don't<00:04:42.010> want<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.190> flip<00:04:42.370> around<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:46.980> Rudy<00:04:47.980> would

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
don't want to flip around and Rudy would

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.180 
don't want to flip around and Rudy would
you<00:04:48.280> like<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.760> honors<00:04:49.060> sure

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.540 

so<00:04:54.190> yeah<00:04:54.370> pretty<00:04:54.520> straightforward<00:04:55.980> just<00:04:56.980> take

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
so yeah pretty straightforward just take

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.270 
so yeah pretty straightforward just take
off<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.940> backing<00:04:58.650> protective<00:04:59.650> tape<00:04:59.860> here<00:05:00.100> off

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
off the backing protective tape here off

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.530 
off the backing protective tape here off
the<00:05:00.520> adhesive<00:05:01.800> peel<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.980> off<00:05:06.240> make<00:05:07.240> sure<00:05:07.270> you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
the adhesive peel that off make sure you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.230 
the adhesive peel that off make sure you
line<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.840> up<00:05:07.930> right<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:09.880> want<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.150> be

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
line it up right and you want to be

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.980 
line it up right and you want to be
pretty<00:05:10.810> exactly<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:12.510> kind<00:05:13.510> of<00:05:13.540> hold<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.810> in

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
pretty exactly to kind of hold it in

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.980 
pretty exactly to kind of hold it in
place<00:05:14.140> what<00:05:14.500> do<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.620> think<00:05:14.830> about<00:05:14.920> that<00:05:15.160> soon

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
place what do you think about that soon

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.740 
place what do you think about that soon
it<00:05:16.990> looks<00:05:17.670> pretty<00:05:18.670> much<00:05:18.760> perfect<00:05:19.480> from<00:05:19.600> this

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
it looks pretty much perfect from this

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.460 
it looks pretty much perfect from this
angle<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:21.360> press<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.540> on<00:05:22.660> there<00:05:22.870> pretty<00:05:23.140> calm

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
angle I press it on there pretty calm

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.860 
angle I press it on there pretty calm
yep<00:05:23.950> as<00:05:24.250> good<00:05:25.240> as<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.450> gets<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:27.750> yeah<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.810> think

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
yep as good as it gets and yeah I think

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.070 
yep as good as it gets and yeah I think
we<00:05:29.290> should<00:05:29.500> be<00:05:29.620> all<00:05:29.650> set<00:05:30.040> here<00:05:30.660> you<00:05:31.660> also<00:05:31.840> might

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
we should be all set here you also might

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.810 
we should be all set here you also might
notice<00:05:32.140> this<00:05:32.590> emblem<00:05:32.890> is<00:05:33.100> ever<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.790> slightly

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
notice this emblem is ever so slightly

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.980 
notice this emblem is ever so slightly
smaller<00:05:34.630> than<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.140> factory<00:05:35.710> one<00:05:35.910> that's<00:05:36.990> just

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
smaller than the factory one that's just

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.230 
smaller than the factory one that's just
how<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:38.260> is<00:05:38.320> they're<00:05:39.220> not<00:05:39.400> exact<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.120> a

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
how it is they're not exact of a

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.770 
how it is they're not exact of a
millimeter<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.410> on<00:05:41.560> some<00:05:41.830> other

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
millimeter and on some other

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.300 
millimeter and on some other
applications<00:05:43.780> they're<00:05:44.020> there<00:05:44.470> there's<00:05:45.250> a

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
applications they're there there's a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.080 
applications they're there there's a
larger<00:05:45.670> difference<00:05:45.820> in<00:05:46.150> size<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:48.310> 2014<00:05:49.320> SI

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
larger difference in size the 2014 SI

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.060 
larger difference in size the 2014 SI
emblems<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.210> actually<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.860> earlier<00:05:53.860> knife

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
gen ones as well they fit they fit good

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.550 
gen ones as well they fit they fit good
there's<00:05:58.330> you<00:05:58.720> haven't<00:05:58.930> had<00:05:59.020> any<00:05:59.170> issues<00:05:59.530> with

get<00:06:05.920> off<00:06:06.040> afterwards<00:06:06.640> it<00:06:06.790> will<00:06:06.880> last<00:06:07.090> through

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
get off afterwards it will last through

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.650 
get off afterwards it will last through
many<00:06:09.040> many<00:06:09.250> hard<00:06:09.610> car<00:06:09.850> washes<00:06:10.270> even<00:06:10.510> if<00:06:10.600> you

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
many many hard car washes even if you

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.090 
many many hard car washes even if you
take<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:11.080> one<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.260> those<00:06:11.410> automatic<00:06:11.800> car

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
take it to one of those automatic car

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.890 
take it to one of those automatic car
washes<00:06:12.900> it<00:06:13.900> won't<00:06:14.080> be<00:06:14.200> a<00:06:14.230> problem<00:06:14.440> at<00:06:14.710> all<00:06:14.830> and

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
washes it won't be a problem at all and

washes it won't be a problem at all and
final<00:06:16.900> step<00:06:17.080> is<00:06:17.320> just<00:06:17.520> take<00:06:18.520> off<00:06:18.669> those<00:06:18.880> dry
