 in which you loved us 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.950

 yes, I am my father, where is my honor 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.360
 and if I am lord where is my fear says 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.330
 jehovah of the armies to you or 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 priests that you despise is my name 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.350
 and you say that we have despised your 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.810
 first name 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.049
 in which you offer bread on my altar 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 unclean and you said that we have 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.070
 dishonored in that you think the table of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 Jehovah is despicable and when you offer 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.580
 the animal is blind to the sacrifice not 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.509
 It's also bad when you offer the lame 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 or the patient is not bad to present it then 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.690
 your prince was pleased with you or 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.989
 Waxes accepted said jehovah of the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.810
 armies now for now it gives by the 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.829
 armies 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:38.060

 says jehovah of the armies nor of 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.090
 your hand I will accept offering 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.700
 because from where the sun rises to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.700
 where it is put is big my name between 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.850

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.660
 nations says jehovah of the armies 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.110
 and you have profaned it when 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.870
 you say unclean is the table of jehovah and 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.510
 when you say that your food is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.069
 negligible 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.700
 you also know 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.940
 armies and you brought jce the stolen or 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.180
 lame or sick and you introduced yourself and your 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:36.310
 offering I will accept that from your hand 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.819
 says cursed jehovah who deceives the one who 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.550
 having males in his flock promises and 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.400
 sacrifice to jehovah what is damaged 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.560
 because I am a great king says jehovah of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.560
 the armies and my name is fearsome
