even a hot dogger well hot georgia might
be<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.450> exception<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.200> i<00:03:29.440> think<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.859> would<00:03:29.950> be

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069

they're wonderful sources
omega-3<00:05:30.889> fatty<00:05:31.040> acids<00:05:31.730> you<00:05:32.240> know<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> lot<00:05:32.570> of<00:05:32.600> us

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
omega-3 fatty acids you know a lot of us

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.170 
omega-3 fatty acids you know a lot of us
eat<00:05:33.230> a<00:05:33.260> lot<00:05:33.650> too<00:05:33.919> much<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.460> omega-6<00:05:34.940> fatty

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
eat a lot too much of the omega-6 fatty

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180 
eat a lot too much of the omega-6 fatty
acids<00:05:35.540> in<00:05:35.630> our<00:05:35.720> diet<00:05:35.780> and<00:05:36.500> then<00:05:36.710> we<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.949> bad

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
acids in our diet and then we have a bad

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.250 
acids in our diet and then we have a bad
ratio<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.699> too<00:05:37.880> much<00:05:38.000> omega-6<00:05:38.150> too<00:05:38.960> little

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
ratio of too much omega-6 too little

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.469 
ratio of too much omega-6 too little
omega-3<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.400> that's<00:05:40.729> not<00:05:40.910> heart-healthy

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
omega-3 and that's not heart-healthy

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.090 
omega-3 and that's not heart-healthy
it's<00:05:41.810> cause<00:05:42.080> inflammation<00:05:42.410> right<00:05:42.919> I<00:05:42.949> think

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
it's cause inflammation right I think

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.560 
it's cause inflammation right I think
causes<00:05:43.400> inflammation<00:05:43.610> omega-3<00:05:44.389> is

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
causes inflammation omega-3 is

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.420 
causes inflammation omega-3 is
anti-inflammatory<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.800> this<00:05:46.100> is<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.280> great

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
anti-inflammatory and this is a great

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.370 
anti-inflammatory and this is a great
plant-based<00:05:46.910> source<00:05:47.210> of<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:47.570> ala<00:05:48.080> which<00:05:48.229> is

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
plant-based source of the ala which is

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.560 
plant-based source of the ala which is
going<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:48.560> convert<00:05:48.860> into<00:05:49.040> the<00:05:49.790> DHA<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.300> we

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
going to convert into the DHA that we

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.600 
going to convert into the DHA that we
need<00:05:50.750> so<00:05:51.169> olive<00:05:51.500> oil<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.800> really<00:05:51.949> high<00:05:52.190> omega-6

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
need so olive oil is really high omega-6

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.640 
need so olive oil is really high omega-6
that's<00:05:53.090> another<00:05:53.330> reason<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.810> avoid<00:05:53.930> it's<00:05:54.530> not

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
that's another reason to avoid it's not

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.379 
that's another reason to avoid it's not
really<00:05:54.919> high<00:05:55.100> it's<00:05:55.400> more<00:05:55.729> high-end<00:05:55.940> mono

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
really high it's more high-end mono

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.000 
really high it's more high-end mono
inside<00:05:56.720> okay<00:05:56.960> fast<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.470> it's<00:05:57.560> not<00:05:57.710> one<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:57.889> the

I mean you know so there's always some
little<00:06:45.470> nuances<00:06:46.039> right<00:06:46.220> there<00:06:46.370> all<00:06:46.460> but<00:06:46.639> if

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
little nuances right there all but if

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.159 
little nuances right there all but if
you<00:06:46.789> were<00:06:46.880> making<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.270> video<00:06:47.539> of<00:06:47.630> a<00:06:47.930> novel

pudding<00:06:48.440> maybe<00:06:48.650> you<00:06:48.800> want<00:06:48.979> to<00:06:49.010> use<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.280> white

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
pudding maybe you want to use the white

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
ones just so a flavor wise definitely

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.870 
ones just so a flavor wise definitely
there's<00:06:51.620> impossible<00:06:52.250> cause<00:06:52.550> that's<00:06:52.729> right

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
there's impossible cause that's right

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.040 
there's impossible cause that's right
but<00:06:52.970> I<00:06:53.000> don't<00:06:53.120> know<00:06:53.180> about<00:06:53.300> anything<00:06:53.630> you<00:06:53.960> know

it<00:06:59.380> but<00:07:00.380> you<00:07:00.979> can<00:07:01.130> use<00:07:01.220> flax<00:07:01.460> seeds<00:07:01.639> in<00:07:01.760> this

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
it but you can use flax seeds in this

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.610 
it but you can use flax seeds in this
recipe<00:07:02.150> the<00:07:02.360> thing<00:07:02.570> is<00:07:02.750> and<00:07:03.050> nutritionally<00:07:03.560> it

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
recipe the thing is and nutritionally it

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620 
recipe the thing is and nutritionally it
would<00:07:03.740> be<00:07:03.830> great<00:07:04.490> but<00:07:04.820> they<00:07:05.270> don't<00:07:05.450> have<00:07:05.539> the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
would be great but they don't have the

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.969 
would be great but they don't have the
property<00:07:06.050> of<00:07:06.080> the<00:07:06.169> chia<00:07:06.380> seeds<00:07:06.620> marinate<00:07:06.950> some

next<00:07:07.310> day<00:07:07.430> absorbs<00:07:08.090> the<00:07:08.210> liquids<00:07:08.510> it<00:07:08.599> creates

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
next day absorbs the liquids it creates

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.629 
next day absorbs the liquids it creates
this<00:07:09.229> is<00:07:09.380> just<00:07:09.530> a<00:07:09.590> wonderful<00:07:10.010> texture<00:07:10.310> does

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
this is just a wonderful texture does

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.610 
this is just a wonderful texture does
that<00:07:10.820> flaxseed<00:07:11.240> make<00:07:11.360> it<00:07:11.450> a<00:07:11.510> little<00:07:11.660> drier<00:07:11.870> it

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
that flaxseed make it a little drier it

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.800 
that flaxseed make it a little drier it
does<00:07:12.800> the<00:07:13.430> liquid<00:07:13.789> never<00:07:14.000> absorbs<00:07:14.510> so<00:07:14.690> it's

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
does the liquid never absorbs so it's

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.659 
does the liquid never absorbs so it's
fine<00:07:15.260> but<00:07:15.440> it<00:07:15.560> just<00:07:15.740> you<00:07:15.889> won't<00:07:16.099> get<00:07:16.250> this<00:07:16.400> nice
