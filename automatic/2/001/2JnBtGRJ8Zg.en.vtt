00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.490
 video about how to make hair for a doll 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.769
 from tape for this we will use 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:20.000
 my satin ribbon is brown 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:21.650
 this color even so chocolate i 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.810
 took a wide ribbon 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.150
 if you already have ears 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.689
 wide then it can be so convenient 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.530
 First, determine the length of hair for 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.380
 this fold in half the tape and here 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.600
 look 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.550
 hair is so long on one side 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.340
 fit we will not fit if needed 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 make shorter scales need two lines 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.570
 make a line like this 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.570
 accept hair 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.820
 well now 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 So 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.900
 take some additions do 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:42.750
 what will be on the photo-wall a little bit 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 shorter so 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.189
 and 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 four 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.560
 five 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.920
 the more you wind off the thicker your hair 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 will be 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.700
 straight 1 2 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.530
 into three zones 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
 cut off 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 so folded smooth clients 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.410
 inflexible hit 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:16.430
 click to mark the middle and 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.430
 in the middle we are stitching 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.870
 you can tape a little bit like this 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.870
 to uncover 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.670
 more beautiful 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.180
 Here we have such a blank 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.340
 those places we glue 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 doll's head where the seam you actually 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:25.180
 we have to dissolve the tape that is 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:39.169
 we take a thread not like this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.169
 dismiss tape 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.050
 you know 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.570
 like this 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:05:01.829
 so until the end and so here we have turned out 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:04.129
 such hair from loose satin 

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:04.129
 tapes 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:15.600
 hairs shiny silky they can 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.310
 twist up 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.160
 using forceps but just not 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:27.300
 heat them up very much 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.300
 all the same it is not hair it is cloth muzychka 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.150
 like these ones 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:44.780
 tails can be braided 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.780
 you can not do this hair 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:54.380
 they are flexible enough for styling 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.380
 see my workshops 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.180
 learn something new develop 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.740
 creative success and all the most 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.740
 good bye everyone
