00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 5 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.260
 when friends among them I propose 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.630
 I bring the review a game called 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.390
 good exodus I think that's how it's pronounced 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 same in the whole story if they do not have 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.440
 the downloads but it seems to be very 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.270
 promising 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.940
 the game in terms of history does not 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.410
 nailed a lot but good is a poor to 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.090
 when editing your avatar but 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.940
 because you are very poor because nothing 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.860
 you can either put it on or be a woman or 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.380
 hundred man you can not edit the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.330
 features or anything like that in play as we play 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.830
 this is the store of all 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.220
 things that the yuri has here I have a 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:53.660
 second good sword that I already have the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.210
 can you increase I think prime yes 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.290
 it's good that you need to increase 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.290
 well I'm going with this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.600
 there you need to have three of those for 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 can read break and then we give here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 I think so and it's supposed to increase 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 later I do not have money it sucks 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 good and if the weapons are removed in the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.660
 skiing we will find it to increase 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 what are our skills increase 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.600
 the level and in question 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.250
 with this as missions that you have to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.500
 comply not for some 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
 extra points and all that we're going to give you 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.480
 play and from there we will appear what 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.450
 are the missions the tutorial of lyon 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.910
 mountain jake and blake that is the last 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 mission not everyone when you enter they have 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.060
 other missions in this case has nine 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.090
 I go in the third and then nothing is a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.030
 game that arcade created arcade 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.800
 error type action that yes I think so 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 not if I do not remember if it's called this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.170
 type of games does not exist the hypothesis goes 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.920
 to be the world and when it is open or 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.920
 it is not an open world 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.759
 but some monsters come out like that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.300
 suppose it was a quiet place 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.300
 they are weird things 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.099
 I think it 's up to android 2.0 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
 It is entertaining 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.670
 but not so fast is it can be 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.069
 playing and suddenly the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.200
 game because he wants to know what other 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.200
 monster type has had another kind of 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.430
 and they also spent very fast but good 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.430
 of this machine this game 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.800
 let's kill the children 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.780
 and killing everyone and they're going to start 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.640
 open doors or roads how will they see 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.280
 right now they are the ones that have to 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.510
 keep going like as missions and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.510
 you find chests 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.300
 both are all together weapons 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.019
 downloadable direct sun away 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.090
 if you are a town that afterwards is not 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.110
 one of the best can not our 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.110
 match the game 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.550
 I found advertising signs or 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.580
 something like that then neither the volume because 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.530
 I know if I'm listening and very much 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.420
 good competitive you do not find 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.400
 advertising something that sometimes complaining 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.880
 we are alone the users of that 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.770
 practically an application they sell it 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.850
 in advertising because they do not leave you or 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.260
 even play but good is a game 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.430
 great, I liked it and that's why 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.190
 I recommend it, I'm going to finish it 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.870
 this edition I think that you go down here and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.840
 there good still does not come out and health that 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.790
 made at the end of this mission and spent 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.790
 well it was going to happen but I saved it 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.790
 uy 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.540
 it's one more game to list these 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.160
 games that I've been and more than anything else 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.110
 I was recommending and well I hope 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.970
 that you play you like as much as 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.070
 to me or a little more I do not know everyone 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.840
 He has his tastes and it was good I know that 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.370
 not everyone will like it but for me it is 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.870
 a very good game that will recommend 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.910
 and more than anything is a game that just 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.150
 leaving does not have like the ego almost does not have 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.919
 downloads and then the effects of the game 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 They are very good. I do not complain about the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.790
 graphics xp boss so to speak 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.630
 of this level that I do not know what it does but it 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.630
 see all more tables 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.630
 twenty 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.539
 I will kill with primers or endure 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.979
 I'm going down nothing I'm going down more 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.759
 lives with my normal blows that with 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.759
 to know 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.440
 although good 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.389
 well I can download books in the 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.250
 description of the video again 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.540
 totally free from the beach history 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.270
 it's a game that promises to be very 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.760
 entertaining no and good I'm a member 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.380

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:17.720
