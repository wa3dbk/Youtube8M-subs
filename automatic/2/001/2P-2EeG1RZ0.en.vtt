 then yes co2online and yes I wanted 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 just like my favorites is something 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.529
 the beauty is his choice and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 to eat something and then I wish 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.670
 so much fun now how are we going 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.700
 sometimes with the category beauty and me 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.890
 First and foremost I have a rouge 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 again a lecturer for me so dwarf and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 Although, the touch flush of essens is in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 the color 20 volumes and I have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 actually used every day and earlier 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.620
 now for the country in peace will have that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 I also in my peace us-cars 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 I use now really right for 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 the color is so beautiful that's one 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 a little bit hearty and really fresh 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 and yes I just like it really 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.829
 and that looked really good a bottle 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 so pigmented for eating and it works 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 In any case, a really nice color 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.990
 mappus I have the whole april real 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 used correctly as the very next one 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.180
 then I have one more lives and one 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.610
 Although that is the imports of currently 15 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 station was robotic arm have decide 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 in the color you can not read anymore 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 In any case, that this sees the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.630
 so a bit newton out but gives 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.340
 a really nice shimmer on the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 lips and I had him without any 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 do not drink so much lipstick 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.290
 But you are really happy 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.409
 enough so I'm so nice to finish 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.150
 finish is just about the chicas so 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.549
 is not really great 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.670
 color but just beautiful and yes me 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.100
 happy and also can to this him 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.290
 The smell she has smelled like that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.840
 really you really have to be the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.060
 right direction so great i can do that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.890
 really smell it all day long 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.219
 In any case , that was also a favorite 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.159
 for me in april 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.750
 next, I have mine 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.540
 first it's the paint and the color 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.520
 saint tropez and i find this color 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.989
 also really nice because it is for 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.209
 in the spring actually rather gaudy 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.440
 I have the colors now I go 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.459
 often used the so rather like when I 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.069
 not so bock you really like 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.540
 discharge and so therefore perfectly 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.879
 then I wear a nice bright 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
 color up and it's just this color 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.260
 and yes I just really like you 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 I would like to cost 8 euros I think 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.700
 and lollipops can be properly 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.129
 Apply nicely and have a nice 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.250
 opacity and yes I have the whole 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.420
 april also really like to use and if 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.550
 I always think so too 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.269
 again , there is always a favorite in front 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.879
 stay there now to the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.470
 I would say lifestyle category 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
 and I do not have that much anymore 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.879
 I also have that many monthly 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.530
 but still some and then 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.390
 Do you have something to eat and I have 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.879
 this month so in the morning 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.459
 always deep plates and I had breakfast 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.440
 I started this month but this 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.250
 girl eating namely that the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.450
 jubilee of vitalis so from dsk the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.190
 classic in especially chocolaty and 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.810
 I still have milk on it 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.099
 just so I did then only at 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.730
 I really like to cut that 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.409
 eaten 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.500
 That's a bit fruity 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:29.190
 and not so much chocolate I just 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.489
 only my cat with the wrong 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.489
 again 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.700
 yes I have it with people who is hanging there 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.530
 you see sitting 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.329
 she just hangs up i leave my cat 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.310
 is in there so in any case I have 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.409
 ancen really liked the medium 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.430
 be raised because I love apple and 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.730
 I love her 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.620
 and then it was fine and I did 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.480
 actually the monthly come every 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.799
 eaten in the morning and also 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.329
 at lunchtime if I wanted to and 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.019
 actually always did not mind 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.030
 and yes so it's tried have 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.989
 that would have to eat with mr prince that must 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.489
 you do because that's really right 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.739
 delicious and it was definitely well 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.599
 a favorite of mine for the april 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.519
 my last favorite for the april was 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.680
 then a series and me 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.609
 again started plc therefore look pretty 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.259
 Little liars and I did not succeed 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.180
 cooked everything five and then I have 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.349
 somehow so from where they follow the way 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.460
 At some point just stopped and 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.300
 just kinda I kept looking 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.250
 training was 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.050
 and there I have this month 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.729
 At some point start to look again 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.810
 and I have feared only by 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.120
 My mistake is simply the best 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.550
 So it's really true 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.229
 so exciting and everyone thinks what is 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.780
 So the matter so full of the boys 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.430
 I know and so it is really stood 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.840
 and also my friend meant his consequence 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.370
 having always looked at it that way 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.940
 exciting and not only so much 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.199
 look 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.330
 the season finale was just 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.610
 unbelievable and I am so happy 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.780
 direct season and if the last one 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.220
 comes out city would again 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.330
 his favorit from me month 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.120
 it would have seen the determined and yes this 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.580
 live is just the best 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.199
 then I had a favorite and that 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.940
 the result is i have a week 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.500
 arrive or maybe not 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.229
 It is still april for me 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.520
 because it's my new cell phone hell and 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.840
 I already have them in my blog 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.449
 shown but they have 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.570
 all have not looked and definitely 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.130
 I watch you all this really holds 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.960
 the little hearts are so pressing 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.610
 little glitter share as they would have 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.840
 those standing who all used to have 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.910
 how it today was the trick to 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.470
 is now ripping from top to bottom and 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.620
 so time for this cover would have over 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.520
 6 07 euro is from amazon and 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.990
 I can stand again which is 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.940
 just sooo awesome because you can get one 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.000
 school if some boredom always has 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.470
 so chairman could listen and hear 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.620
 pay attention and yes that would be in any case 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.610
 but a favorite of mine and this one so so 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.169
 so cool really so i love you i 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.590
 Incidentally, they have the American 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.669
 viewed youtube and two alu jetix and 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.710
 then I will have it right away 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.620
 I was so sorry I was ordered because 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.360
 that is so cool my last favorite for 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.950
 the month of april is also one 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.870
 black pants that I bought 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.910
 I can somehow get it somewhere 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.289
 has ever shown close in any case 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.199
 just unfortunately you and I am I 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:23.380
 visor you have a picture of arrow 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.020
 and he has his black with 23 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.610
 smile of zara 150 euro cost 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.440
 and somehow I never had the black one 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.940
 pants i just never got black 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.960
 worn here is the black dreamed 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.490
 but almost no black 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.789
 clothes is completely weird was black 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.419
 in the real green color and yes I have 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.820
 i bought from the day i arrived in 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.580
 Hamburg with my friends 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.919
 I also blocked that and thus 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.900
 the pants gets bought and I love 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.039
 Since then it was right so me 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.870
 actually always have a holsterhausen 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.010
 worn because it looked so good 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.020
 me and I have somehow never like that 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.500
 good pants ever found good 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.620
 sit 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.840
 continue to have the really good are so 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.090
 have been strong and that 's just what 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.370
 makes them so comfortable and also with 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.050
 holes are really really cozy 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.720
 and also good and I love those 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.990
 pants now a bit longer line 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.400
 In any case, if I am more 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.230
 I do not have any leather jacket 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.740
 teacher here 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.240
 But actually it is funny that I am 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.620
 just not satisfied with the pants 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.640
 not recommended 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.650
 I think I'm on the way 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.160
 then I'll have another look 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.480
 music on such a normal halt because white 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.830
 Holsterhausen is not mainstream 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.930
 and then you can go to sarah 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.480
 Dodge so that you already mean mine 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.190
 Not all that many, but I think so 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.540
 it was flat hopefully i think it was 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.800
 maybe hopefully interesting 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.210
 for you and then I would quite a 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.600
 very nice day and me on my bed 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.740
 in my cell , james continues 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.800
 There is not quite here 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.780
 very nice day in bed I can 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.780
 my hands on wide völkel like so much
