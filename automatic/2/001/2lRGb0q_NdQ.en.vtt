and today I'm gonna be talking to you
guys<00:00:05.130> about<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.029> Merkava<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.930> exactly<00:00:07.500> what

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
guys about the Merkava and exactly what

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.820 
guys about the Merkava and exactly what
it<00:00:07.890> what<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.210> really<00:00:09.929> quick<00:00:10.139> whoo<00:00:10.500> crazy

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it what it is so really quick whoo crazy

it what it is so really quick whoo crazy
Makabe<00:00:11.309> well<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> Mercado<00:00:12.150> was<00:00:12.450> actually

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
Makabe well the Mercado was actually

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 
Makabe well the Mercado was actually
created<00:00:13.019> by<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> naturals<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:15.299> was<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
created by the naturals and it was it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
created by the naturals and it was it
was<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.560> human<00:00:16.890> body<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.490> actually

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
was the human body that they actually

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
was the human body that they actually
designed<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> key<00:00:19.770> components

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
designed and one of the key components

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
designed and one of the key components
that<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> human<00:00:20.730> body<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.150> being<00:00:21.390> an<00:00:21.510> energy

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that the human body was being an energy

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.950 
that the human body was being an energy
device<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.580> our<00:00:23.730> energy<00:00:24.060> device<00:00:24.660> were

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
device so with our energy device were

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630 
device so with our energy device were
not<00:00:25.230> only<00:00:25.380> were<00:00:25.590> able<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> tap<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.490> other

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
not only were able to tap into other

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.910 
not only were able to tap into other
energies<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.269> frequencies<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
energies and frequencies but we have the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.769 
energies and frequencies but we have the
capability<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> doing<00:00:29.779> multi-dimensional

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
capability of doing multi-dimensional

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.229 
capability of doing multi-dimensional
travel<00:00:31.230> instantaneously<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.940> way<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
travel instantaneously and the way that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
travel instantaneously and the way that
we<00:00:33.329> were<00:00:33.390> able<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.350> by<00:00:34.500> tapping

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
we were able to do that is by tapping

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.979 
we were able to do that is by tapping
into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> concept<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> Merkava<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.780> turn

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
into the concept of the Merkava or turn

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
into the concept of the Merkava or turn
her<00:00:37.140> body<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.559> Merkava<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.910> essence<00:00:39.300> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
her body into Merkava so in essence you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.330 
her body into Merkava so in essence you
can<00:00:39.629> say<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> markaba<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> ship

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
can say that the markaba is like a ship

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
can say that the markaba is like a ship
that<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.760> instantaneously<00:00:42.350> transform

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that we can instantaneously transform

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
that we can instantaneously transform
her<00:00:43.469> body<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> go<00:00:44.539> inter-dimensionally<00:00:45.539> into

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
her body and go inter-dimensionally into

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.130 
her body and go inter-dimensionally into
different<00:00:46.260> dimensions<00:00:46.739> without<00:00:47.399> any<00:00:47.789> ease

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
different dimensions without any ease

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
different dimensions without any ease
instantaneously<00:00:49.160> just<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> Angels<00:00:50.969> did

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
instantaneously just like the Angels did

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840 
instantaneously just like the Angels did
in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.719> ancient<00:00:51.870> times<00:00:52.520> just<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> new

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in the ancient times just like the new

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
in the ancient times just like the new
throughs<00:00:54.180> dude<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.870> turn<00:00:55.079> themselves<00:00:55.230> into

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
throughs dude they turn themselves into

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
throughs dude they turn themselves into
body<00:00:55.800> therefore<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.340> did<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.730> need

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
body therefore they did not need

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
body therefore they did not need
technology<00:00:57.690> or<00:00:57.809> ships<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.680> all<00:00:58.980> energy

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
technology or ships it was all energy

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
technology or ships it was all energy
based<00:01:00.199> now<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> word<00:01:01.770> Makabe<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> concept

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
based now the word Makabe or the concept

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
based now the word Makabe or the concept
of<00:01:03.300> macabre<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:04.260> talking<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.710> many<00:01:04.920> ancient

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of macabre was talking in many ancient

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
of macabre was talking in many ancient
scriptures<00:01:05.700> however<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.900> Hebrews<00:01:07.530> were<00:01:07.650> one

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
scriptures however the Hebrews were one

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.840 
scriptures however the Hebrews were one
of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> people<00:01:08.310> who<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
of the people who make it more

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.050 
of the people who make it more
mainstream<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.110> popular<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.400> now

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mainstream or made more popular so now

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
mainstream or made more popular so now
the<00:01:12.119> people<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> ask<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.890> why<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the people are going to ask how or why I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
the people are going to ask how or why I
haven't<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.729> lost<00:01:15.060> our<00:01:15.270> connection<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
haven't we lost our connection to the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.820 
haven't we lost our connection to the
markaba<00:01:17.159> well<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> lost

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
markaba well just like you know we lost

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.940 
markaba well just like you know we lost
our<00:01:20.040> connection<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.960> divine<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.890> were

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
our connection to divine or we we were

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
our connection to divine or we we were
on<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.280> evolutionary<00:01:23.820> planet<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> reason

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
on this evolutionary planet the reason

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.170 
on this evolutionary planet the reason
why<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.710> loss<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.549> connection<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
why we got loss of this connection of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
why we got loss of this connection of
our<00:01:27.299> body<00:01:27.540> design<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.220> became<00:01:29.490> more

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
our body design is we became more

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760 
our body design is we became more
material<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.810> became<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.259> material

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
material and as we became our material

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
material and as we became our material
we<00:01:31.920> became<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.430> heavily<00:01:32.820> dependent<00:01:33.270> on

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we became more heavily dependent on

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
we became more heavily dependent on
technology<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.290> therefore<00:01:34.920> instead<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
technology so therefore instead of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.590 
technology so therefore instead of
looking<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.850> things<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.450> within

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
looking at things that we can do within

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960 
looking at things that we can do within
our<00:01:36.780> body<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.590> started<00:01:37.860> using<00:01:37.979> technology<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
our body we started using technology to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
our body we started using technology to
do<00:01:39.240> some<00:01:39.450> things

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
do some things

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.679 
do some things
and<00:01:40.079> externally<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.030> example<00:01:42.450> when<00:01:42.600> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and externally so for example when we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.109 
and externally so for example when we
travel<00:01:43.110> obviously<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> car<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
travel obviously we have a car but you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
travel obviously we have a car but you
know<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.869> obviously<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.470> traveling<00:01:46.860> from

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
know but obviously like traveling from

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520

started<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.840> kind<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.380> got<00:02:13.470> distributed<00:02:13.860> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
started we kind of got distributed that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.970 
started we kind of got distributed that
energy<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.910> district<00:02:15.810> disrupted<00:02:16.709> and

energy got to district disrupted and
therefore<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:17.940> made<00:02:18.180> us<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.510> our

therefore that has made us more our

therefore that has made us more our

in between dimensions have but to go
back<00:03:39.570> into<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:40.080> gain<00:03:40.260> our<00:03:40.470> concept<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
back into we gain our concept of the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.950 
back into we gain our concept of the
macabre<00:03:41.520> once<00:03:41.850> again<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.450> have<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.750> learn<00:03:42.900> how

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
macabre once again we have to learn how

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.150 
macabre once again we have to learn how
to<00:03:43.940> work<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.150> unison<00:03:45.570> with<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.959> mind<00:03:46.260> body<00:03:46.770> and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
to work in unison with the mind body and

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
to work in unison with the mind body and
spirit<00:03:47.550> because<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> mind<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.720> bodies

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
spirit because the mind and bodies

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.600 
spirit because the mind and bodies
always<00:03:49.170> fluid<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.160> always<00:03:50.340> shifting

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
always fluid and is always shifting

always fluid and is always shifting
however<00:03:51.570> our<00:03:51.900> physical<00:03:52.440> body<00:03:52.680> doesn't<00:03:53.370> right

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
however our physical body doesn't right

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.860 
however our physical body doesn't right
now<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:53.910> very<00:03:54.150> dense<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.780> very<00:03:56.300> very<00:03:57.300> hard

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
to shift and what you want to do is you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.790 
to shift and what you want to do is you

going<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.570> take<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.690> lot<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.260> time<00:04:16.620> however<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
going to take a lot of time however the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.880 
going to take a lot of time however the

basics forms of it is learning how to

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.400 
basics forms of it is learning how to
fast<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.640> very<00:04:20.820> long<00:04:21.030> time<00:04:21.299> meditate<00:04:22.260> to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
fast for a very long time meditate to

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.900 
fast for a very long time meditate to
keep<00:04:22.560> yourself<00:04:22.919> focused<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.430> your<00:04:23.550> energy

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
keep yourself focused in your energy

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.350 
keep yourself focused in your energy
focus<00:04:24.800> tapping<00:04:25.800> into<00:04:25.950> sacred<00:04:26.280> geometry<00:04:26.580> and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
focus tapping into sacred geometry and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.610 
focus tapping into sacred geometry and
then<00:04:27.450> also<00:04:27.630> breathing<00:04:28.169> because<00:04:28.470> with

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
then also breathing because with

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.650 
then also breathing because with
breathing<00:04:29.070> were<00:04:29.280> pulling<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> energy<00:04:30.390> into

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
breathing were pulling the energy into

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.060 
breathing were pulling the energy into
our<00:04:30.690> body<00:04:30.960> we're<00:04:31.350> pushing<00:04:31.530> throughout<00:04:31.950> our

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
our body we're pushing throughout our

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.770 
our body we're pushing throughout our
aura<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.760> we're<00:04:33.030> keeping<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.390> energy

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
aura and we're keeping the energy

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.200 
aura and we're keeping the energy
flowing<00:04:34.130> when<00:04:35.130> sacred<00:04:35.430> geometry<00:04:35.669> is<00:04:36.030> really

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
flowing when sacred geometry is really

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.730 
flowing when sacred geometry is really
interesting<00:04:36.720> because<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.229> also<00:04:37.470> was

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
interesting because that also was

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.650 
interesting because that also was
created<00:04:38.070> by<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.250> ancients<00:04:38.729> which<00:04:39.210> also

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
created by the ancients which also

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.350 
created by the ancients which also
helped<00:04:40.050> us<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:41.130> like<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.340> key<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.940> our<00:04:42.060> aura

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
helped us it's like a key to our aura

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.900 
helped us it's like a key to our aura
and<00:04:42.660> chart<00:04:42.900> DNA<00:04:43.290> but<00:04:43.890> so<00:04:44.040> by<00:04:44.280> focusing<00:04:44.760> on

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
and chart DNA but so by focusing on

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.360 
and chart DNA but so by focusing on
certain<00:04:45.180> sacred<00:04:45.840> geometry<00:04:46.260> symbols<00:04:46.979> they

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
certain sacred geometry symbols they

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.070 
certain sacred geometry symbols they
could<00:04:47.580> tap<00:04:47.760> into<00:04:47.790> our<00:04:48.120> left<00:04:48.360> hemisphere<00:04:48.510> and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
could tap into our left hemisphere and

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.140 
could tap into our left hemisphere and
our<00:04:49.229> right<00:04:49.380> hemispheres<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.130> unlock<00:04:50.550> certain

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
our right hemispheres and unlock certain

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.400 
our right hemispheres and unlock certain
DNA<00:04:51.540> codes<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.770> key<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:55.020> some<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
DNA codes like a key to see some of the

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.080 
DNA codes like a key to see some of the
powers<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:55.860> has<00:04:56.280> been<00:04:56.400> hitting<00:04:56.669> within<00:04:56.970> our

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
powers that has been hitting within our

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.900 
powers that has been hitting within our
DNA<00:04:57.590> so<00:04:58.590> when<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.890> unlock<00:04:59.250> these<00:04:59.400> codes

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
DNA so when you unlock these codes

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.070 
DNA so when you unlock these codes
it<00:05:00.270> makes<00:05:00.510> your<00:05:00.630> cell<00:05:00.840> your<00:05:01.200> cell<00:05:01.640> react<00:05:02.640> and

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
it makes your cell your cell react and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.320 
it makes your cell your cell react and
make<00:05:04.080> your<00:05:04.229> body<00:05:04.350> more<00:05:04.820> able<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.970> do<00:05:06.090> things

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
make your body more able to do things

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.969 
make your body more able to do things
that<00:05:06.479> we're<00:05:06.630> not<00:05:06.720> able<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.020> do<00:05:07.290> how<00:05:07.770> though<00:05:07.919> you

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
that we're not able to do how though you

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.010 
that we're not able to do how though you
need

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
need

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.469 
need
take<00:05:09.410> your<00:05:09.530> geometry<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.819> when<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.300> that

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
take your geometry and when you do that

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.820 
take your geometry and when you do that
what<00:05:11.720> happens<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:12.199> will<00:05:12.319> make<00:05:12.470> your<00:05:12.620> body

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
what happens it will make your body

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.460 
what happens it will make your body
stronger<00:05:13.819> it<00:05:14.330> will<00:05:14.449> make<00:05:14.840> your<00:05:15.050> body<00:05:15.229> more

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
stronger it will make your body more

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.230 
stronger it will make your body more

capability<00:05:43.639> with<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.389> themselves<00:05:44.509> so<00:05:45.110> they

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
capability with it themselves so they

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.670 
capability with it themselves so they
still<00:05:46.099> have<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.580> do<00:05:47.680> multi-dimensional

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
still have to do multi-dimensional

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.980 
still have to do multi-dimensional
travel<00:05:49.190> through<00:05:49.520> technology<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.780> because

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
travel through technology and because

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.020 
travel through technology and because
they<00:05:51.319> have<00:05:51.470> to<00:05:51.590> do<00:05:51.710> that<00:05:51.979> a<00:05:52.220> lot<00:05:52.639> of<00:05:52.759> them<00:05:52.849> can

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
they have to do that a lot of them can

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.879 
they have to do that a lot of them can
only<00:05:53.240> travel<00:05:53.690> up<00:05:53.900> to<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.139> sixth<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.560> seventh
