00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I'm done I can just throw the paper

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.920 
I'm done I can just throw the paper
plate<00:01:10.409> away<00:01:12.770> close<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.920> door

there<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:45.040> are<00:01:45.070> got<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.730> hit<00:01:45.970> right<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.330> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
there we are got a hit right in the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.670 
there we are got a hit right in the
center<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.870> button<00:01:47.050> otherwise<00:01:47.470> it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
center of the button otherwise it

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.540 
center of the button otherwise it
doesn't<00:01:47.830> work<00:01:47.980> right<00:01:48.750> okay<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:51.310> down

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
doesn't work right okay and then down

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.230 
doesn't work right okay and then down
here<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.800> start<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:54.700> we're<00:01:54.850> going<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.030> push

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
here is the start so we're going to push

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.320 
here is the start so we're going to push
that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.920 

and<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.260> can<00:02:00.590> see<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.950> cook<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.630> as<00:02:02.630> it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
and now you can see it cook it as it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.640 
and now you can see it cook it as it
counts<00:02:03.260> down<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.650> seconds<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.600> I'm<00:02:06.440> gonna

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
counts down the seconds and I'm gonna

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.010 
counts down the seconds and I'm gonna
try<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.070> hold<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> camera<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
try to hold the camera up so that the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.750 
try to hold the camera up so that the
wind<00:02:09.260> doesn't<00:02:09.470> blow<00:02:09.710> into<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.190> microphone

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
wind doesn't blow into the microphone

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.410 
wind doesn't blow into the microphone
otherwise<00:02:11.720> all<00:02:11.960> you'll<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:12.440> wind<00:02:12.680> noise

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.570 

and<00:02:17.660> as<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:18.530> see<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:19.040> don't<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.400> if<00:02:19.490> you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and as you can see I don't know if you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580 
and as you can see I don't know if you
can<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
can see it in there but the the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.620 
can see it in there but the the
sandwiches<00:02:22.069> are<00:02:22.250> cooking<00:02:22.490> actually<00:02:23.480> they're

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
sandwiches are cooking actually they're

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.030 
sandwiches are cooking actually they're
not<00:02:23.660> really<00:02:23.780> cooking<00:02:24.380> they're<00:02:24.530> just<00:02:24.709> heating

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
not really cooking they're just heating

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.570 
not really cooking they're just heating
up<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.540> melt<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.900> cheese<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> little<00:02:27.560> bit

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
up like to melt the cheese a little bit

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.260 
up like to melt the cheese a little bit
so<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.480> usually<00:02:30.780> running<00:02:31.710> running<00:02:32.370> about<00:02:32.610> 40

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
so it usually running running about 40

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.540 
so it usually running running about 40
seconds<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:34.050> sandwiches<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.430> to
