00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.440
 Hello everyone new video today and this one 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.269
 time I would like to show you all the little things 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 which I bought from itself if the new one 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 the collection that came out now is 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.210
 the collection they hold 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.300
 proposed which is called happy holidays 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 I must say that it is the collection at the beginning 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.439
 it didn't particularly hit me 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.480
 when I saw it on the site then though 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.580
 looking at goods produced in the store 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 because I had some time in the end 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 I am found to buy some things and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.149
 so I wanted to let you see it that way because 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.850
 video essence failures are always 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.160
 very much and then it's ok you know mine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 fixed with videos so this one does not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.629
 I could not make a veil before doing them 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.700
 see the products I wanted to tell you how 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.649
 I remind you every now and then that all that 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 that I wear lipstick in the video 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 enamel the jersey everything in other words 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 serious earrings in Libya today 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.860
 in any case you always find it in the info 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 box below the video is always below 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 find all the links to follow me either 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 sad that even on facebook on twitter 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 here twitter is not that I still have 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 learned to use it very well though 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 maybe if you want to follow me there too and 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.070
 giving me some advice makes me happy in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.650
 on the contrary, it is really my drug 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 daily meal then to show you 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.939
 what i bought first i have 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 only took two of the three eye shadows that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.189
 they were available because the third color 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.439
 it was a light Belgian belgium that I said 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 neither really nor the many do not take it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.280
 but these two seemed to me 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
 really super pigmented and I don't have 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.430
 could do without it also because in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 this period or a pizza for 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 the combination of these two colors 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 hence the pink strawberry violet with the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.200
 Both are very green 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 by the way it amazed me this is here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 the 0 1 sugar plum wound and is a rose 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.189
 really writers like that is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.720
 remained and is very singer in the sense 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 that also its own nuances 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.149
 tending to purple I love it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 as a color in fact when I was 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.270
 in store to another cai 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.759
 surely it has a color that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 you can probably find among the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.610
 my thousand 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.200
 of pallets, however, seemed to me so 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.270
 cute and write that I wanted 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.730
 take it also because the mono eye shadows 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.100
 I always find them very comfortable to carry 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 around and then I took that too 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.870
 green which is a very beautiful green 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.590
 I find these greenbacks to be difficult 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 to find 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.980
 this too is super super writer 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.620
 really it is so much a writer and I am 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.989
 very nice because they are designed 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 above a bow the ball of 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.069
 Christmas and what the sweetie calls you 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.350
 that shape of colored stick of 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.580
 Christmas are really nice even in the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.560
 Packaging is this what 03 secular and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.130
 just a tree color of 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.290
 Christmas 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.060
 in any case , I didn't tell you the prices 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.040
 because right now as usual 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.110
 name of remembrance but they always came 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.239
 in the info box near the name of the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.580
 products that I show you then I took 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.560
 these decorations for and nail art in 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.080
 fimo pasta are also present in these 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.330
 they are all on the red on the verdict 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.690
 white there are little Santa Claus 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.390
 there are canes are always causes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.910
 these white and red le 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.269
 Christmas balls the decorations that 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.750
 type is called clover is not called 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.760
 clover now the name does not come to me the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.320
 mistletoe mistletoe is called or are 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.049
 portions sprigs those in which one 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.450
 they beat the balls escaped butcher's broom 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.790
 girls there are also decorations a 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.320
 form of then after was however the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.910
 why I went to the stand 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.280
 that is, I wanted these decorations for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.810
 nails because at 20 a nail art 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.820
 and then in the end it goes well I went out with 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.410
 other things, however, this one is here 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.359
 I think it's the highlight of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.859
 collection because it is a beautiful idea 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.950
 that of having made decorations 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.510
 in fimo paste and then all the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.239
 things that have to do that Christmas in 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.430
 I really like this moment 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.209
 I also took the elastics for 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.080
 hair 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.940
 these are the ones who turn and age 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.910
 yes well it is a rubber band for hair with 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.460
 particularity that has the two balls 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.740
 silver that in fact remain at the top 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.140
 at the tail or at the top of the game you have 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.269
 in short, I liked it a lot 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.580
 because now that I'm doing more and more 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.170
 soon the queue I also like to change 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.460
 a little to issue some elastic bands 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.890
 details 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.480
 and then I took the false eyelashes again 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.760
 these also seemed to me 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.260
 I am very happy with it 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.110
 the false eyelashes of the collection 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.700
 permanent essence not really 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.800
 I never use the glue they have on their own 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.350
 internal but I see that there is also in these 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.780
 the glue is beautiful because it is 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.090
 simple on the first part then they are 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.250
 all full of inter gold so they go 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.240
 great to do a Christmas trick or 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.130
 of new year 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.260
 and in short, I always find myself well 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.750
 the particular tests the false eyelashes of 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.390
 s then I then took them again offended 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.720
 this tints of elite balm this is here 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.390
 the pink one is the serious sugar plum 0 2 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.640
 precisely a colored lip balm 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.350
 you know how much I love these products I know 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.169
 that there are also in the collection 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.540
 permanent in the new one arouses however 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.310
 I have no idea if the color is equal them 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.890
 they just changed the name maybe who 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.900
 have it make me let me know if there is 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.210
 some difference between the two gods 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.190
 associated because I do not have the other or not 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.620
 I have an idea so I said but let's take it 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.600
 this of the limited edition that maybe 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.220
 it has a slightly more particular color I hope 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.890
 to have done well in short 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.200
 and then under your advice I took 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.360
 even the teak blush this one is a 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.460
 I also took this cream 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.760
 rose because you know my landline with i 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.750
 pink is this here is the 0 2 sugar plum 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.400
 faithful and it is this violet pink that 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.590
 very much the color of the eyeshadow 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.380
 which I bought so I think they will do 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.570
 fine belocchi together you have me 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.820
 spoke well of everything blush and I wanted 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.630
 try it because the new ones came out to me 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.669
 don't like them 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.860
 the last thing I believe that too 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.780
 I think the most particular set 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.390
 to the decorations in fimo paste is 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.790
 this enamel which is an effect polish 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.080
 snow is practically done as I do not know if 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.270
 I can explain those to myself 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.129
 balls where there are encloses the cities 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.860
 that you have to turn it into the water 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.629
 turn around and the snow effect comes on 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.810
 this glaze is the same, that is, it is 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.699
 turn it shake and that is practically the 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.900
 dispersion of this snow effect 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.580
 very beautifull 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.560
 now we will have to see how it is about 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.539
 nails because being a video I don't have it 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.969
 still tried but the idea struck me 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.199
 so very much these were all 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.840
 purchases I made with the 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.000
 s Christmas collection let me know 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.370
 if you also bought something e 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.379

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.669

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.039
 your first impressions 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.110
 in any case I hope the video is there 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.449
 useful condition you enjoyed it if there is 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.150
