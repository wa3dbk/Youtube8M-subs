00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.029
 hello very good listen to your request 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.920
 so before showing the analysis of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.170
 terminals decided to speak in this video 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.910
 apart from the photographic charts of 9 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.230
 640 pixels of which a few days ago 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.820
 I commented on first impressions that 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.890
 you can see if you have not seen it yet 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.029
 our channel in the part of the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.730
 recording all the main aspects 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.560
 of the 1,647 and in this microsoft these 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.260
 it's worth emphasizing that you give them brothers 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.460
 small those of 640 as we are going to see I'm going 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.840
 to start with the back that in this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.670
 case protrudes a tad of the part 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.680
 later and it has a sensor 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.199
 13 megapixels that is a great 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.379
 resolution with autofocus flash 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.519
 led and the famous carl zeiss optics in 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.289
 this case does not become a camera 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.769
 previous to lack of stabilizer 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.649
 optical 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.390
 the camera has a focal 2.0 of relative 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.429
 opening that will capture a large 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.710
 amount of light as well as a distance 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.040
 28 mm focal length and a range of 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 10-cent minimum approach 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.560
 we must recognize that this data 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 They promise to play well in it 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.770
 translate before I start I have to 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 say that the photograph has been taken 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.040
 by the application lumia camera 5 that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.990
 until today we had only seen it in 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.240
 some terminals but that comes from 6 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.980
 in this 9 640 x l 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.360
 this application brings new features 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.040
 one of them the famous capture 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 enriched that we will activate by pressing the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
 wand that we see at the top and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 that way we can adjust to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.700
 Subsequent parameters to increase or 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.510
 decrease the dynamic range of the photo or 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 even completely eliminate the hdr 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.300
 another of the novelties of the dynamic flash 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 which is nothing more than applying a technique 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.650
 as the hdr with flash to activate this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.869
 option we will have to activate the capture 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.150
 enriched and the flash by touching it 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.770
 to bar in photography with and without flash 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.660
 this way we can play then with the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.180
 precise level of lighting that 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.110
 We want you to have the final photo 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.150
 make a capture we will have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.009
 different default options without 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.229
 flash or exchange and the one that allows 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.580
 customize and adjust how we want the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.320
 true that if the application lumia 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.640
 camera I loved now with these 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.470
 new functions I liked even more 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.490
 so I'm glad there's also 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.290
 Built-in camera number 50 or fable 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.640
 to perform this analysis of the camera 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860
 Most of the photographs have been 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 taken with the mind by default of the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.939
 application illuminate camera 5 except in 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.409
 some which uses a manual approach in 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.390
 this sense the camera is fast to the 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.800
 time to focus as well as when 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 take the picture as you can see 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280
 also from the same application is 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.810
 possible to click on the icon 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 shutter speed adjust the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.420
 exposure time being the speed 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.440
 maximum shutter speed of four seconds 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 I'm going to start with the results 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.019
 photographs that are simpler for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.849
 the camera that are the ones taken in 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.880
 external and as conditions of 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.230
 light the images and images in these 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.610
 performances are excellent with a good 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.709
 level of detail and correct handling 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.269
 of the dynamic range with respect to 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.799
 colors the result is not so positive 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.780
 since the colors as you can see are not 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.340
 appreciate so vivid what causes the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 final image does not look as real as 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.060
 we would like among the images as 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.319
 you also want to include some with 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.060
 shadow areas to see the 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.890
 behavior in those situations of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.239
 high contrast of light and that as you can see 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.160
 camera correctly solves 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.870
 without seeing the shadows completely to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.430
 dark I also want to show a 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.620
 enlarged image to appreciate the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.030
 level of detail in this case as you see 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's pretty good thanks to the 13 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 megapixels that the camera incorporates 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.110
 xl 640 may seem a level of 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.520
 relatively low noise 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.870
 in this last image I want you to see what 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.610
 that we can get by playing a little 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.870
 with the focus of the umÃ­a camera and is that 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
 although in this case the focus as 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.680
 close we can also focus 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.710
 a distant object getting some 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.270
 very cool effects 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.580
 where he most appreciates the problems of 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.920
 cameras is in the hands taken with little 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.240
 night luxury in this case as you see there 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.040
 that bring a situation to the camera 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.060
 complicated as it is in an open place and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 with about the lighting that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.020
 they provide streetlights showing a 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.370
 more than acceptable result although 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.350
 evidently able to get rid of 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.150
 noise go with the colors even less 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.320
 defined despite this I have to 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.090
 recognize that the results have 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.380
 pleasantly surprised now you see a 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.390
 second image of an even more situation 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.650
 complicated indoors without further 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.690
 lighting than the flash that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 the camera incorporates a photograph that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.660
 you can consider acceptable but if I 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.820
 I would have liked the flash to be a 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.900
 little more powerful despite this without 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.110
 doubt can serve us in more than one 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.730
 chance 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.080
 in this photograph taken in this 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.520
 photograph taken at night in my case 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.750
 what a terrible pulse I have to 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.360
 recognize that I miss a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.340
 optical stabilizer and now I'll look for two 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.840
 weeks taken from the same place in two 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.610
 different situations for you to do 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.920
 an idea of â€‹â€‹the remarkable difference of 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.630
 details between the image taken at night 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.500
 like the one you see and the same taken from 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.359
 day 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.579
 and before talking about the front camera 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.420
 or I want to show a video that 640 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.500
 pixels that is capable of recording at 1080p to 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.500
 30 frames per second 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.150
 it's the turn to talk about the camera 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.650
 front that like crazy of the celtics 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.300
 that I am as sure many of you 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.819
 an aspect that we have more and more in 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.919
 consideration when purchasing a phone 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.860
 for this reason microsoft has incorporated 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.439
 a 5 megapixel front with one 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.599
 2.4 wide-angle camera aperture and 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:15.139
 24 mm focal length 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.669
 certainly able to record in full hd in 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.750
 this type of camera is not an important 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.159
 the resolution that in this case is 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.990
 enough considering so that 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.520
 is but also that they are happy to regulate 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.039
 because it is a photograph that is made 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.539
 walking distance ie show you 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.830
 the images taken outdoors and with 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.029
 natural light because I think it's one of 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.099
 the most usual situations when 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.719
 let's make ourselves a self and the result 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.460
 it seems pretty good to me and that we can 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:36.319
 get water split if we use lumia 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.939
 self and an application with which 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.919
 we can apply filters as well 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.419
 improvements to enlarge the eyes enlarge 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.100
 our smile and even for 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.660
 teeth whitening 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.600
 until the analysis of the section 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.770
 photographic of the 1640 xl as a conclusion 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.300
 You can say that it has excellent 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.040
 rear camera that as you have seen 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.690
 good results as well as the 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.920
 perfect front to be the end the 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.140
 icing of this section is that the 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.030
 phone has a camera 5 a 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.440
 application with which we can take the 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.690
 maximum match to the photographs taken 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.040
 with the main camera the point 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.690
 negative of the one who did not talk so far 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.250
 is that it does not find with button dedicated to 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.810
 the camera a button that are missing to the 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.910
 time to take a picture with a 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.170
 only hand because complicated to hold the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.810
 phone and at the same time press the screen 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.040
 without moving it involuntarily it costs 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.810
 even more to do a sergio because 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.890
 in addition a larger plus tel telephone and 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.400
 more of my case that I have some hands 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.200
 little 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.880
 still and quiet I'm taking 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.170
 now I hope you have liked to forget 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.250
 to lose already of the comments if 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.130
 you have any other questions too 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.470
 you can do it and nothing else in a few days 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.670
 through the complete analysis of the thousand 640 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.670
 pixels until soon
