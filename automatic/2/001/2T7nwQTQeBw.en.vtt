00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
this is small the simplest one we made

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.340 
this is small the simplest one we made
you<00:01:16.190> can<00:01:16.340> see<00:01:16.550> straight<00:01:17.210> up<00:01:17.480> like<00:01:17.660> you<00:01:17.690> stretch

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
you can see straight up like you stretch

and<00:01:19.010> one<00:01:19.280> up<00:01:19.610> there<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.920> here's<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.400> top<00:01:22.760> and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
and one up there and here's on top and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.730 
and one up there and here's on top and
we<00:01:23.660> are<00:01:23.720> using<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.260> remote<00:01:24.440> control<00:01:24.950> one<00:01:26.740> you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
we are using the remote control one you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.400 
we are using the remote control one you
have<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.860> subtract<00:01:28.430> writers<00:01:29.290> there's<00:01:30.290> a

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
have to subtract writers there's a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:39.310 
have to subtract writers there's a
little<00:01:30.710> bridge<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.430> how<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.320> track

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
little bridge this is how the track

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.890 
little bridge this is how the track
looks<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.550> know<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.119> if<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.300> can<00:01:41.750> make

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
looks as you know that if you can make

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.170 
looks as you know that if you can make
