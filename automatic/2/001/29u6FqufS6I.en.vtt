00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
happen would be you know Nemo's all

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.340 
happen would be you know Nemo's all
grown<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
grown up now and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.080 
grown up now and
he<00:01:32.590> knows<00:01:32.740> about<00:01:32.920> life<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.580> everything<00:01:33.790> but

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
he knows about life and everything but

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.840 
he knows about life and everything but
as<00:01:34.240> all<00:01:34.420> teenagers<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:36.340> through<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.640> phase

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
as all teenagers go through this phase

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.179 
as all teenagers go through this phase
you<00:01:37.330> know<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:37.689> become<00:01:37.990> rebels<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.070> think

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
you know they become rebels so I think

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.340 
you know they become rebels so I think
you<00:01:39.520> know<00:01:39.549> Nemo<00:01:40.000> would<00:01:40.119> get<00:01:40.299> lost<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.900> rebel

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
you know Nemo would get lost the rebel

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.490 
you know Nemo would get lost the rebel
rebel<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.659> run<00:01:43.810> away<00:01:43.900> from<00:01:44.049> home<00:01:44.290> or

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
rebel and just run away from home or

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.920 
rebel and just run away from home or
something<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:46.060> get<00:01:46.240> lost<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.690> it'll<00:01:46.869> be

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
something and just get lost and it'll be

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.740 
something and just get lost and it'll be
called<00:01:47.140> finding<00:01:47.649> nemo<00:01:47.979> again<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.119> think<00:01:49.420> I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
called finding nemo again so I think I

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.779 
called finding nemo again so I think I
like<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.990> think<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:50.350> too<00:01:50.759> personally<00:01:51.759> I

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
like I think that's too personally I

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.920 
like I think that's too personally I
think<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.030> would<00:01:52.090> be<00:01:52.180> too<00:01:52.360> simple<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
think that would be too simple of a

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.840 
think that would be too simple of a

twisted<00:01:58.869> realistically<00:01:59.710> if<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.190> if<00:02:00.369> they<00:02:00.490> ever

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
twisted realistically if I if they ever

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.100 
twisted realistically if I if they ever
do<00:02:00.820> make<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> sequel<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.450> Finding<00:02:01.570> Nemo<00:02:01.780> which

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.899 
do make a sequel to Finding Nemo which
I'm<00:02:02.259> sure<00:02:02.440> they<00:02:02.590> will<00:02:02.740> but<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.100> personally

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.770 
think that they're going to touch on
pollution<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.759> oil<00:02:07.060> spills<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
pollution and like oil spills and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.969 
pollution and like oil spills and
