00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.750
 groundwater characteristic 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.110
 water is formed due to seepage 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.520
 in the ground atmospheric and surface waters 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.549
 groundwater can be without pressure 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.800
 and pressurized artesian non-pressure 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.810
 groundwater 1 from the surface of the earth 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.640
 the aquifer are called 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.990
 ground water 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.820
 characterized by increased 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.619
 contamination therefore with their 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.259
 use in most cases 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.900
 pressure cleaning required 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.030
 artesian waters fill the aquifers 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.920
 fully artesian water horizons 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.830
 generally characterized by high 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.610
 quality and in most cases for 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.460
 drinking purposes can 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.320
 used without cleaning in wells 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 or wells hiding pressure 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.050
 aquifers 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.060
 water rises to some 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.830
 piezometric line if 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.850
 piezometric arena and passes above 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.970
 surface of the earth 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.560
 the observed water spout water level 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.900
 installed in the well when 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.610
 the absence of water intake is called 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.380
 static in free-flow waters 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.720
 static level matches level 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.300
 groundwater at pressurized waters with 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.490
 piezometric line when pumping water 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.550
 from the well the level of you is reduced and 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.910
 the more the more intensive pumping such 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.650
 level is called dynamic 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.360
 non-pressure and pressure water can 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.120
 go to the ground 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.070
 springs outflow of unconfined waters called 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.590
 downtre key spring water 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.110
 characterized by high quality and can 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.840
 used without cleaning underground 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.720
 Water water located deep in the mountain 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.540
 rocks of the upper crust in liquid 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.550

 table 1 technical reference 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.850
 degree man for water treatment 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.800
 presents the characteristics of the underground 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.229
 waters on the main indicators of chemical 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.630
 the composition of the table shows that the underground 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.360
 waters have low microbiological 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.150
 pollution low turbidity constant 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.030
 temperature and chemical composition is almost 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.260
 complete lack of oxygen 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.460
