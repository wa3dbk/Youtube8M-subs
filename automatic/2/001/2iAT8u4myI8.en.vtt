 uci cinemas and I will be present too 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 join me and let us see that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.880
 sport in italy is something to which 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880
 we hold 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.570
 hi there are three but if they are here 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.310
 to talk to you about something that really is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.620
 an answer to a question that is me 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.780
 very recently done is one 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.630
 question concerning the sandbox monde 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.110
 sandbox mode is very fast 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.680
 that modality that practically you 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.070
 makes it gives you a chance to be able to test 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.500
 league of legends with all settings 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.640
 coletti quality protection of gold the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.320
 minutization levels you have 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 experience and lull the action to a hundred 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.720
 percent of his famous things of the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.580
 gender 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 in practice like the life you can 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.230
 do the fuck he wants 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 many people said hey but this 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.040
 third way of the decoder to train the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.690
 professional professionals of course 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.810
 they protested when he laughs it 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 publicly announced that it is not the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.210
 focus but what they stand for 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.150
 using at the moment but let's go with 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.790
 then calm the sandbox mod 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.870
 until the announcement at riot it was one thing 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.440
 that on the professionals asked for sun 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.660
 26 list there were very few people that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.260
 protested for having a sandbox way to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.760
 sooner and then rai did that 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.110
 there is not a couple of weeks ago where 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.150
 he started making this blog on 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.040
 guidice what we are doing what 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 we are doing right now that is 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.500
 what is their focus of work and on what 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 what is not well 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 was not dedicated to the live boxes that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.460
 I would say and they too after five years of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 technical debt debts 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.479
 for those who did not know the bruise techniques 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.759
 when you do a bad thing at the beginning and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.710
 then later you have to enter fix it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.080
 casino that you did well 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.240
 the rai hotels and for five years it must 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.250
 remedy this technical debt e 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.690
 finally he is doing it got life 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 alleluia I would also say the speech is that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.580
 then in the blog they continue saying things 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.360
 we are not worrying about the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.360
 replay system and the sandbox system 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.340
 mode a replay system you say ok by me 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.280
 there are more alternatives work 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.959
 at least it's not a serious home loss 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.630
 instead there are professionals in box mode 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.220
 who started in the live raids give a damn 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.540
 My mini minimum and then in the meantime 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 Your word says they won't do it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 written that is not their famous moment 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.400
 I'm the devil's lawyer on my ass 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.080
 because yes there is no writing that does not 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.209
 they will never do and that they don't keep it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.489
 consideration says a lot 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.540
 it is simply not our focus is a 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.320
 moment 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.420
 at the moment we have to do we have to do 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.820
 on the client I would say it's one thing 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.010
 quite important 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.950
 very well what started protesting 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.950
 my minimum of six months 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.459
 ok ok 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.260
 I can understand that it is complicated by 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.540
 explain but try to make a comparison 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.370
 very simple what you are 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.350
 asking is to build on 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:38.459
 foundations of a palace palafitte 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:45.890
 it's not clear ok the client sucks ago 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:49.440
 suck and chest slow motion bliss suck 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.230
 absolutely crap there is nothing more 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.549
 bad that the rai has ever planned 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.620
 in addition to the screenshots that have them 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.010
 rewritten from scratch a couple of putt done 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.879
 but that's another one 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.610
 cutting the talk is this you can't 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.459
 build a sandbox or other system 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.980
 strangest and most curious modes without 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.019
 make trouble already in the ways 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.640
 alternatives you must make a bang and 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.500
 they have always explained that we must 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.209
 make us an android that was a slot for 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.889
 doing it is not because I say it because I am 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.039
 lazy or say why scheduled to 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.330
 shit client hold up these things for i 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:28.030
 client type or crazy 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.100
 adobe air sucks and they had decided to 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.139
 time to program in adobe air e 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.289
 so now they have to readjust everything 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.970
 how all everything with a 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.570
 most suitable programming language 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.870
 is more flexible at the time it is 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.720
 nothing this is what we must therefore 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.750
 just wait if it fits 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.930
 screwed the client for the pre-season 6 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.419
 they want not to let it out 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.820
 so I would say we also hope well then 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.590
 between priorities begins to rise to 6 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.660
 box but once you've done 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.150
 beautiful reinforced concrete foundations that 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.310
 don't bomb her then build us 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.660
 a fool above don't invest 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.639
 over a pile of water no thanks really no 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.380
 I don't want to see the client 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.330
 grows because someone has launched one 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.950
 box mode in itself with nests 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.530
 30 percent concept 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.560
 of bonus ap from level 1 with fawns 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:30.100
 because you can have fun seeing the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.140
 breath no I don't want to see clearly 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.630
 very well this is my opinion 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.430
 wait patiently don't break the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.950
 fuck since there's a lot of people 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.020
 that sees him break his balls break 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.660
 the service balls of the services 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.590
 rather efficient than rai knows what 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.080
 must do 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.850
 fuck the plan we want every day on 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.190
 reddit you think he doesn't know what 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.740
 we want 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:04.130
 come on this is all for this 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:06.050
 video I am three and see you in 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.550

 then you can spend these points for 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.240
 buy some inside the heirs 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.460
