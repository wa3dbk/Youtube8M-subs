up<00:01:35.649> here<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.190> blade<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:37.539> course

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
up here on the blade and of course

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
up here on the blade and of course
gerber<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:40.920> lock<00:01:41.920> back<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.909> secure

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.430 

and<00:01:50.070> we've<00:01:51.070> got<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.310> case<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
and we've got the case which is the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.320 
and we've got the case which is the
nylon<00:01:53.830> sheath<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.400> lightweight<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:54.850> it's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
nylon sheath it's lightweight and it's

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.630 
nylon sheath it's lightweight and it's
military<00:01:55.840> grade<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.890> mildew<00:01:57.310> read<00:01:57.460> it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
military grade and it's mildew read it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.170 
military grade and it's mildew read it
resistant<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.280> sheath<00:02:00.520> allows<00:02:00.820> for

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
resistant the sheath allows for

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.499 
resistant the sheath allows for
horizontal<00:02:01.960> or<00:02:02.200> vertical<00:02:02.650> carry<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.979> guess

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
horizontal or vertical carry and I guess

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.280 
horizontal or vertical carry and I guess
also<00:02:07.509> included<00:02:07.990> here<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:10.260> priorities<00:02:11.260> of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
also included here is a priorities of

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.880 
also included here is a priorities of
survival<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.620> got<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:16.890> plow

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
survival so what we got here is a plow

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.690 
survival so what we got here is a plow
us<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.430> fairly<00:02:18.850> sharp<00:02:19.239> knife<00:02:19.570> we<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.080> there
