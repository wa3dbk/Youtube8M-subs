misconception that the only real
difference<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.980> fans<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> actual<00:00:20.880> spin

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
difference in fans is the actual spin

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
difference in fans is the actual spin
speed<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> size<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> fan<00:00:22.619> well<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
speed and the size of the fan well as we

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.769 
speed and the size of the fan well as we
look<00:00:23.640> through<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.240> range<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.660> be

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
look through the different range that be

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.089 
look through the different range that be
quiet<00:00:25.050> offers<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.650> see<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> there's

quiet offers we see that there's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
quiet offers we see that there's
different<00:00:26.369> technologies<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.060> design<00:00:27.359> tools

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
different technologies and design tools

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.330 
different technologies and design tools
used<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.800> developing<00:00:29.220> the

sleeving<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
sleeving on there but like I say with it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
sleeving on there but like I say with it
being<00:01:01.770> an<00:01:01.859> entry-level<00:01:02.160> family<00:01:02.670> orientated

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
being an entry-level family orientated

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
being an entry-level family orientated
towards<00:01:03.600> being<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> best<00:01:04.170> value<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.040> money

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
towards being the best value for money

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
towards being the best value for money
whilst<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.180> compromising<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.900> silence<00:01:07.380> or

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
whilst not compromising on silence or

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.109 
whilst not compromising on silence or
performance<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
performance so we can see it's a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
performance so we can see it's a
standard<00:01:09.479> fun<00:01:09.720> house<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.350> less<00:01:10.560> typical

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
standard fun house in there less typical

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590 
standard fun house in there less typical
what<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.430> seeing<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> kiss<00:01:12.060> fans<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
what we're seeing a lot of kiss fans and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000 
what we're seeing a lot of kiss fans and
then<00:01:12.930> obviously<00:01:13.049> we've<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.710> quiet

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then obviously we've got the be quiet

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880 
then obviously we've got the be quiet
funds<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.970> actual<00:01:15.930> grooving<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> fan

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
funds and the actual grooving on the fan

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
funds and the actual grooving on the fan
blades<00:01:17.130> either<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.520> quiet<00:01:17.790> form<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.240> helps

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
blades either be quiet form which helps

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
blades either be quiet form which helps
reduce<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.560> air<00:01:19.740> flawed<00:01:20.070> nice<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.520> well

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
reduce at all air flawed nice as well

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
reduce at all air flawed nice as well
now<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> interesting<00:01:21.990> thing<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
now the interesting thing about this is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.810 
now the interesting thing about this is
even<00:01:22.979> though<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> their<00:01:23.520> low<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
even though it's one of their low in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.399 
even though it's one of their low in
front<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.450> still<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> rifle<00:01:25.290> barrel

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
front it does still have a rifle barrel

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
front it does still have a rifle barrel
in<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.280> means<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> actual

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
in there which means that the actual

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.749 
in there which means that the actual
chef<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> fun<00:01:28.680> roar<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.430> bearing

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
chef for the fun roar into the bearing

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
chef for the fun roar into the bearing
is<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.299> grooves<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.990> rifling

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
is it's got grooves in it like rifling

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
is it's got grooves in it like rifling
down<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> barrel<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> does<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.329> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
down a barrel and what that does is that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
down a barrel and what that does is that
helps<00:01:33.900> circulate<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.040> lubricant<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
helps circulate the lubricant so that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
helps circulate the lubricant so that
when<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> mount<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> fan<00:01:36.720> either<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
when you mount the fan either in the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
when you mount the fan either in the
back<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> case<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> hole<00:01:38.700> like

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
back of the case like that hole like

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.050 
back of the case like that hole like
that<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.570> actual<00:01:39.810> shaft<00:01:40.619> isn't<00:01:41.070> isn't<00:01:41.670> gain

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that the actual shaft isn't isn't gain

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
that the actual shaft isn't isn't gain
any<00:01:42.299> spots<00:01:42.540> where<00:01:42.720> there's<00:01:42.899> no<00:01:43.020> lubricant

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
any spots where there's no lubricant

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.469 
any spots where there's no lubricant
which<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.770> give<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> obviously<00:01:44.820> noise<00:01:45.000> from

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
which will give you obviously noise from

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
which will give you obviously noise from
the<00:01:45.540> rotation<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> fun<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the rotation of the fun that so the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.560 
the rotation of the fun that so the
rightfully<00:01:47.640> helps<00:01:47.909> keep<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> lubricant

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
rightfully helps keep the lubricant

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
rightfully helps keep the lubricant
moving<00:01:48.869> about<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:50.070> keeps<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> fan<00:01:50.640> quite

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
moving about and it keeps the fan quite

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
moving about and it keeps the fan quite
as<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.409> silent

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
as well so that's it for these silent

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
as well so that's it for these silent
wings<00:01:52.829> pure<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> said<00:01:53.670> they're<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.000> chula

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
wings pure like I said they're in chula

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.770 
wings pure like I said they're in chula
but<00:01:55.280> if<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.759> take<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> shadow

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
but if we then take a look at the shadow

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
but if we then take a look at the shadow
wings<00:01:58.020> first<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:58.950> looking<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> back

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
wings first of all looking at the back

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
wings first of all looking at the back
of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> box<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.149> could<00:02:00.360> obviously<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.840> much

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
of the box it could obviously it's much

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
of the box it could obviously it's much
much<00:02:01.500> more<00:02:01.710> detailed<00:02:02.070> packaging<00:02:02.579> than<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
much more detailed packaging than the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.399 
much more detailed packaging than the
entry-level<00:02:03.090> fat<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.170> gray

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
entry-level fat and that little gray

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
entry-level fat and that little gray
strip<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.829> tells<00:02:05.070> us<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.610> premium<00:02:06.090> range

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
strip that tells us that premium range

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.089 
strip that tells us that premium range
one<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.229> i<00:02:07.290> could<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> look<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.890> what<00:02:08.009> we

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
one so i could have a look at what we

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.900 
one so i could have a look at what we
actually<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.789> one

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
actually get with this one

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090 
actually get with this one
you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.240> they're<00:02:12.830> slightly<00:02:13.830> better

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
you can see they're slightly better

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.190 
you can see they're slightly better
presented<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> then<00:02:15.270> on<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> rear<00:02:15.690> you've

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
presented and then on the rear you've

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800 
presented and then on the rear you've
got<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.560> user<00:02:17.040> manual<00:02:17.490> drawing<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.000> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
got a little user manual drawing that so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.210 
got a little user manual drawing that so
first<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.350> all<00:02:19.410> let's<00:02:19.470> see<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.920> comes<00:02:20.070> with

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
first of all let's see if it comes with

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.850 
first of all let's see if it comes with
any<00:02:20.310> accessories<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.990> she<00:02:22.110> does<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.860> our

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
any accessories and she does we have our

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.140 
any accessories and she does we have our
this<00:02:26.070> time<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> different<00:02:26.820> method<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
this time we have a different method of

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.700 
this time we have a different method of
mounting<00:02:27.270> we've<00:02:27.600> got<00:02:27.750> some<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:28.080> push<00:02:28.440> pins

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
mounting we've got some little push pins

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.610 
mounting we've got some little push pins
they're<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.820> plastic<00:02:30.320> pins<00:02:31.320> their

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
they're so little plastic pins their

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.950 
they're so little plastic pins their
that<00:02:31.770> push<00:02:31.800> through<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.220> help<00:02:32.460> give<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.960> also

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
that push through and help give it also

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.420 
that push through and help give it also
got<00:02:34.080> some<00:02:34.260> rubber<00:02:34.470> washers<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.190> obviously

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
got some rubber washers so obviously

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.160 
got some rubber washers so obviously
that<00:02:35.580> helps<00:02:35.880> reduce<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.360> actual<00:02:36.630> vibration

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that helps reduce the actual vibration

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.630 
that helps reduce the actual vibration
into<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> case<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.800> keep<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> fan<00:02:38.250> quiet<00:02:38.490> so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
into the case and keep the fan quiet so

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.630 
into the case and keep the fan quiet so
we've<00:02:38.760> got<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> silent<00:02:39.330> mounting<00:02:39.630> option<00:02:39.900> there

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
we've got a silent mounting option there

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950 
we've got a silent mounting option there
we<00:02:41.640> also<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:43.190> molex<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.570> 7<00:02:45.570> volt<00:02:45.750> fan

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
we also have a molex to 7 volt fan

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.270 
we also have a molex to 7 volt fan
adapter<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.500> there's<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.920> an<00:02:47.010> inline

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
adapter so there's actually an inline

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.090 
adapter so there's actually an inline
resistor<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.210> think<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.890> would<00:02:49.980> be

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
resistor in there I think so it would be

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.610 
resistor in there I think so it would be
a<00:02:50.130> resistor<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.210> here<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.660> helps<00:02:51.900> slow<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
a resistor in here that helps slow it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.110 
a resistor in here that helps slow it
down<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:52.950> bit<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.580> keep<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> fan

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
down a little bit and keep the fan

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.420 
down a little bit and keep the fan
running<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.680> little<00:02:55.680> bit<00:02:55.830> slower<00:02:56.070> than<00:02:56.250> normal

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
running a little bit slower than normal

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.840 
running a little bit slower than normal
so<00:02:56.970> about<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:58.070> we<00:02:59.070> also<00:02:59.220> have<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:02.220> again<00:03:02.430> as

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
so about that we also have so again as

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.130 
so about that we also have so again as
we<00:03:02.970> get<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> fun<00:03:03.270> other<00:03:03.420> box<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.810> first<00:03:03.990> thing

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
we get the fun other box the first thing

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.320 
we get the fun other box the first thing
you<00:03:04.230> notice<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:05.220> an<00:03:05.370> old<00:03:05.550> black<00:03:05.730> cable<00:03:06.000> less

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
you notice is so an old black cable less

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.530 
you notice is so an old black cable less
a<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.870> bit<00:03:07.020> stealthier<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> actual

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
a little bit stealthier and the actual

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.850 
a little bit stealthier and the actual
mechanism<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.720> housing<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> fan<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
mechanism and housing for the fan is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
mechanism and housing for the fan is
completely<00:03:11.400> different<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.820> time<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
completely different this time it's a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
completely different this time it's a
custom<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> standard<00:03:13.740> standard

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
custom one it's not a standard standard

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
custom one it's not a standard standard
on<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.880> used<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.860> also

grooved fan blades to help reduce fun
noise<00:03:33.920> again<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.160> one<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.520> rifle

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910

bear<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.300> think<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.690> slightly<00:03:36.900> higher

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
bear and I think it's a slightly higher

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.780 
bear and I think it's a slightly higher
quality<00:03:37.709> one<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.860> think<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.190> might<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.489> copper

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
quality one I think it might be a copper

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
quality one I think it might be a copper
shaft<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.720> call<00:03:39.959> me<00:03:40.110> Alexa<00:03:40.410> no

Tyler<00:03:40.920> Shaw<00:03:41.100> we've<00:03:41.940> got<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.150> standard<00:03:42.480> fan

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
Tyler Shaw we've got the standard fan

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330 
Tyler Shaw we've got the standard fan
blades<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.470> then<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.800> look<00:03:43.920> round<00:03:44.100> here

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
blades and then as we look round here

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.540 
blades and then as we look round here
we've<00:03:44.850> also<00:03:45.000> got<00:03:45.300> these<00:03:45.500> rubber<00:03:46.500> mounts<00:03:46.920> which

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
we've also got these rubber mounts which

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.880 
we've also got these rubber mounts which
I<00:03:47.850> don't<00:03:47.910> believe<00:03:48.480> are<00:03:48.690> removable<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.680> that

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
I don't believe are removable not that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.949 
I don't believe are removable not that
fixed<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.270> have<00:03:51.450> these<00:03:51.660> rubber

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
fixed in that you do have these rubber

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.600 
fixed in that you do have these rubber
mounts<00:03:52.350> which<00:03:52.530> when<00:03:52.709> using<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.160> push<00:03:53.340> pins

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
mounts which when using the push pins

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.520 
mounts which when using the push pins
you<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.270> now<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.600> fam<00:03:54.959> virtually

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
you can now the fam virtually

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.590 
you can now the fam virtually
vibration-free<00:03:56.130> keeping<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:56.970> nice<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.390> quiet

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
vibration-free keeping it nice and quiet

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600 
vibration-free keeping it nice and quiet
so<00:03:58.140> we've<00:03:58.260> got<00:03:58.380> like<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.920> sit<00:03:59.280> for<00:03:59.580> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
so we've got like that I sit for the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.890 
so we've got like that I sit for the
shutter<00:04:00.360> wings<00:04:00.860> Pakistan<00:04:01.860> side<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.840> now<00:04:03.840> we

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
shutter wings Pakistan side and now we

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.320 
shutter wings Pakistan side and now we
have<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.709> pinnacle<00:04:05.250> fan<00:04:05.670> which<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
have the pinnacle fan which is the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.259 
have the pinnacle fan which is the
silent<00:04:06.840> wings<00:04:06.930> too<00:04:07.260> so<00:04:07.830> again<00:04:08.130> much<00:04:08.550> much<00:04:09.090> more

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
silent wings too so again much much more

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.420 
silent wings too so again much much more
well<00:04:09.450> presented<00:04:09.750> their<00:04:10.170> battle<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.920> doubt<00:04:11.160> box

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
well presented their battle a doubt box

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.310 
well presented their battle a doubt box
obviously<00:04:12.300> gives<00:04:12.480> us<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> little<00:04:12.810> blurb<00:04:13.110> about

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
obviously gives us a little blurb about

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.840 
obviously gives us a little blurb about
the<00:04:13.590> bearing<00:04:13.920> type<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.400> now<00:04:14.550> this<00:04:14.670> one

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the bearing type and this now this one

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.150 
the bearing type and this now this one
is<00:04:14.880> actually<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.209> liquid<00:04:15.570> berry<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.530> around<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
is actually a liquid berry so around the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.130 
is actually a liquid berry so around the
actual<00:04:17.459> shaft<00:04:17.760> there<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.539> film<00:04:18.960> of<00:04:19.080> liquid

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
actual shaft there is a film of liquid

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.659 
actual shaft there is a film of liquid
and<00:04:19.530> when<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.710> fun<00:04:19.890> starts<00:04:20.280> spinning

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
and when the fun starts spinning

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.980 
and when the fun starts spinning
centrifugal<00:04:21.539> force<00:04:21.780> spreads<00:04:22.109> out<00:04:22.229> liquid<00:04:22.530> out

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
centrifugal force spreads out liquid out

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.510 
centrifugal force spreads out liquid out
sous-chef<00:04:23.229> perfectly<00:04:23.979> balanced<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.430> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
sous-chef perfectly balanced in the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.430 
sous-chef perfectly balanced in the
middle<00:04:24.729> give<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.330> optimum<00:04:25.780> performance<00:04:25.900> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
middle give you optimum performance and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.170 
middle give you optimum performance and
silence<00:04:26.860> it<00:04:26.979> also<00:04:27.220> reduces<00:04:27.370> friction<00:04:27.880> which

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
silence it also reduces friction which

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.879 
silence it also reduces friction which
helps<00:04:28.479> increase<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.319> lifespan<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.770> the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
helps increase the lifespan of the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.580 
helps increase the lifespan of the
actual<00:04:30.190> fan<00:04:30.400> so<00:04:31.120> if<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.330> check<00:04:31.539> this<00:04:31.660> one<00:04:31.840> out

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.930 

so<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.919> first<00:04:36.099> thing<00:04:36.250> we've<00:04:36.490> got<00:04:36.520> are<00:04:36.910> these

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
so the first thing we've got are these

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
so the first thing we've got are these
different<00:04:37.449> mounting<00:04:37.750> options<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:39.069> have

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
different mounting options so we have

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.550 
different mounting options so we have
this<00:04:39.789> mounting<00:04:40.270> option<00:04:40.599> here<00:04:40.780> which<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.380> for

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
this mounting option here which is for

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.469 
this mounting option here which is for
their<00:04:41.710> silent<00:04:42.400> pushpin<00:04:42.759> option<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.360> can

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
their silent pushpin option so you can

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.450 
their silent pushpin option so you can
put<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.750> little<00:04:43.900> push<00:04:44.080> pins<00:04:44.319> and<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.680> but<00:04:45.370> if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
put the little push pins and that but if

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.730 
put the little push pins and that but if
you<00:04:45.580> if<00:04:46.000> you're<00:04:46.300> traveling<00:04:47.050> around<00:04:47.229> we<00:04:47.440> kiss

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
you if you're traveling around we kiss

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.170 
you if you're traveling around we kiss
and<00:04:48.069> you<00:04:48.160> would<00:04:48.310> that<00:04:48.490> these<00:04:48.639> mine<00:04:48.849> actually

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
and you would that these mine actually

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.700 
and you would that these mine actually
hold<00:04:49.479> up<00:04:49.660> do<00:04:50.169> up<00:04:50.289> these<00:04:50.470> fittings<00:04:50.800> instead<00:04:52.710> put

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
hold up do up these fittings instead put

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.499 
hold up do up these fittings instead put
one<00:04:53.830> out<00:04:53.860> there<00:04:54.130> we've<00:04:54.970> got<00:04:55.090> these<00:04:55.210> fins

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
one out there we've got these fins

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.790

one let's just pop that in there left no
try<00:05:34.030> that<00:05:34.180> one<00:05:34.270> again

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.510 

there<00:05:41.330> we<00:05:41.390> go<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:42.470> you<00:05:42.560> come<00:05:42.740> out<00:05:42.860> one<00:05:43.070> facing

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
there we go so you come out one facing

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.740 
there we go so you come out one facing
that<00:05:43.640> way<00:05:43.700> and<00:05:43.940> then<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.150> can<00:05:44.300> use<00:05:44.480> the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
that way and then you can use the

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.840 
that way and then you can use the
standard<00:05:45.080> cross<00:05:45.830> threaded<00:05:46.220> screws<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:46.730> we

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
standard cross threaded screws that we

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.810 
standard cross threaded screws that we
saw<00:05:47.000> earlier<00:05:47.030> so<00:05:47.600> these<00:05:47.750> ones<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:48.980> melt<00:05:49.220> into

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
saw earlier so these ones to melt into

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.520 
saw earlier so these ones to melt into
the<00:05:49.940> bakkie<00:05:50.150> case<00:05:50.540> and<00:05:50.900> then<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.110> can<00:05:51.260> fit<00:05:51.410> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
the bakkie case and then you can fit the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.660 
the bakkie case and then you can fit the
other<00:05:51.650> ones<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:51.980> you<00:05:52.040> can<00:05:52.190> mount<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.580> a

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
other ones and you can mount it to a

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.970 
other ones and you can mount it to a
radiator<00:05:53.060> or<00:05:53.420> anything<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:53.900> desire<00:05:54.020> so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
again like I said this time we've got a

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.840 
again like I said this time we've got a
braided<00:05:57.500> cable<00:05:57.860> on<00:05:57.920> this<00:05:58.100> now<00:05:58.310> if<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:58.520> noticed

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
braided cable on this now if you noticed

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.310 
braided cable on this now if you noticed
in<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.060> other<00:05:59.240> videos<00:05:59.570> like<00:05:59.900> so<00:06:00.110> for<00:06:00.260> example

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
in the other videos like so for example

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.920 
in the other videos like so for example
when<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:00.710> did<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:01.010> shadow<00:06:01.520> rock<00:06:01.790> no<00:06:02.570> lead<00:06:02.720> a

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
when I did the shadow rock no lead a

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.890 
when I did the shadow rock no lead a
croc<00:06:03.290> pro<00:06:03.940> you'll<00:06:04.940> notice<00:06:05.120> that<00:06:05.210> this<00:06:05.480> fun<00:06:05.720> was

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
croc pro you'll notice that this fun was

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.240 
croc pro you'll notice that this fun was
also<00:06:06.170> featured<00:06:06.380> in<00:06:06.590> their<00:06:06.800> slightly

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
also featured in their slightly

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.370 
also featured in their slightly
different<00:06:07.700> design<00:06:07.970> same<00:06:08.270> technology<00:06:08.780> and<00:06:09.260> the

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
different design same technology and the

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.350 
different design same technology and the
fan<00:06:09.560> cable<00:06:09.830> was<00:06:10.100> significantly<00:06:10.790> sure<00:06:11.000> on<00:06:11.180> this

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
fan cable was significantly sure on this

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.720 
fan cable was significantly sure on this
so<00:06:12.080> like<00:06:12.230> I<00:06:12.260> said<00:06:12.380> be<00:06:12.650> quiet<00:06:12.680> do<00:06:13.160> Taylor<00:06:13.490> all

volt one there we've got 7 volt on there
and<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:41.930> 12<00:06:42.140> volt<00:06:42.260> on<00:06:42.470> there<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:42.800> if<00:06:42.860> you<00:06:42.950> want<00:06:43.070> to

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
and a 12 volt on there so if you want to

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.800 
and a 12 volt on there so if you want to
vary<00:06:43.340> the<00:06:43.430> actual<00:06:43.790> fan<00:06:44.000> speed<00:06:44.300> on<00:06:44.450> this<00:06:44.570> one

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
vary the actual fan speed on this one

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.720 
vary the actual fan speed on this one
and<00:06:45.260> you<00:06:45.470> can<00:06:45.500> do<00:06:45.800> that<00:06:45.920> by<00:06:46.130> connecting<00:06:46.370> it<00:06:46.670> to

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
and you can do that by connecting it to

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.860 
and you can do that by connecting it to
these<00:06:47.060> different<00:06:47.480> ones<00:06:47.630> which<00:06:47.840> have

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
these different ones which have

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.990 
these different ones which have
different<00:06:48.140> resistance<00:06:48.830> which<00:06:49.550> give<00:06:49.910> you

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
different resistance which give you

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.610 
different resistance which give you
slower<00:06:50.240> or<00:06:50.450> faster<00:06:50.480> fun<00:06:50.960> have<00:06:51.140> fun<00:06:51.170> spin<00:06:51.560> in

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
slower or faster fun have fun spin in

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.070 
slower or faster fun have fun spin in
speeds<00:06:52.150> then<00:06:53.150> got<00:06:53.270> our<00:06:53.420> little<00:06:53.780> lingual

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
speeds then got our little lingual

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.120 
speeds then got our little lingual
instructions<00:06:55.690> so<00:06:56.690> that's<00:06:57.500> obviously<00:06:57.710> with<00:06:58.070> a

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
instructions so that's obviously with a

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.620 
instructions so that's obviously with a
different<00:06:58.490> moment<00:06:58.640> options<00:06:59.120> obviously

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
different moment options obviously

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.900 
different moment options obviously
through<00:06:59.960> using<00:07:00.380> the<00:07:00.590> pushpin<00:07:01.010> fittings<00:07:01.370> etc

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
through using the pushpin fittings etc

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.000 
through using the pushpin fittings etc
and<00:07:02.600> how<00:07:02.900> are<00:07:02.960> you<00:07:03.050> going<00:07:03.170> to<00:07:03.260> man<00:07:03.380> that<00:07:03.620> but

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
and how are you going to man that but

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.290 
and how are you going to man that but
like<00:07:04.100> I<00:07:04.160> say<00:07:04.370> with<00:07:04.520> a<00:07:04.580> different<00:07:04.880> range<00:07:05.030> of<00:07:05.240> the

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
like I say with a different range of the

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.210 
like I say with a different range of the
be<00:07:05.420> quiet<00:07:05.690> fans<00:07:05.990> you<00:07:06.230> do<00:07:06.380> go<00:07:06.590> from<00:07:06.800> different

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
be quiet fans you do go from different

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.590 
be quiet fans you do go from different
features<00:07:07.610> two<00:07:07.730> different<00:07:08.030> benefits<00:07:08.180> two

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
features two different benefits two

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.120 
features two different benefits two
different<00:07:08.930> technologies<00:07:09.440> on<00:07:09.590> each<00:07:09.710> and<00:07:09.920> every

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
different technologies on each and every

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.790 
different technologies on each and every
one<00:07:10.250> and<00:07:10.490> each<00:07:11.060> fan<00:07:11.420> has<00:07:11.690> an<00:07:11.960> incredible<00:07:12.620> life

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
one and each fan has an incredible life

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.560 
one and each fan has an incredible life
span<00:07:13.160> on<00:07:13.280> it<00:07:13.400> I<00:07:13.550> think<00:07:14.120> the<00:07:14.500> silent<00:07:15.500> wings<00:07:15.680> pure

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
span on it I think the silent wings pure

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.510 
span on it I think the silent wings pure
features<00:07:17.570> of<00:07:17.720> 200,000<00:07:18.500> our<00:07:18.620> lifespan<00:07:19.190> yet

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 
features of 200,000 our lifespan yet

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.350 
features of 200,000 our lifespan yet
200,000<00:07:20.270> hours<00:07:20.360> and<00:07:21.110> shadow<00:07:21.350> wings<00:07:21.620> features

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
200,000 hours and shadow wings features

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.610 
200,000 hours and shadow wings features
200,000<00:07:23.360> hours<00:07:23.450> as<00:07:23.690> well<00:07:23.720> it's<00:07:24.140> like<00:07:24.410> I<00:07:24.440> say

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
200,000 hours as well it's like I say

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.080 
200,000 hours as well it's like I say
it's<00:07:24.740> a<00:07:24.800> rifle<00:07:25.160> bear<00:07:25.310> in<00:07:25.460> technology<00:07:25.850> in<00:07:25.940> there

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
it's a rifle bear in technology in there

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.870 
it's a rifle bear in technology in there
and<00:07:26.390> then<00:07:26.690> these<00:07:26.780> silent<00:07:27.200> wings<00:07:27.320> to<00:07:27.880> 300,000

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
and then these silent wings to 300,000

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.850 
and then these silent wings to 300,000
hours<00:07:29.150> so<00:07:29.840> you<00:07:29.930> can<00:07:30.110> see<00:07:30.260> that<00:07:30.290> going<00:07:30.560> from<00:07:30.800> a

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
hours so you can see that going from a

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.040 
hours so you can see that going from a
rifle<00:07:31.250> bearing<00:07:31.640> as<00:07:32.300> opposed<00:07:32.600> to<00:07:32.690> a<00:07:32.720> standard

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
rifle bearing as opposed to a standard

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.900 
rifle bearing as opposed to a standard
berry<00:07:33.290> and<00:07:33.800> then<00:07:33.920> go<00:07:34.040> into<00:07:34.070> liquid<00:07:34.580> bearing

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
berry and then go into liquid bearing

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.580 
berry and then go into liquid bearing
you<00:07:35.000> do<00:07:35.120> get<00:07:35.360> a<00:07:35.390> significant<00:07:36.020> increase<00:07:36.200> in<00:07:36.410> the

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 
you do get a significant increase in the

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.680 
you do get a significant increase in the
life<00:07:36.770> span<00:07:37.010> you<00:07:37.070> fan<00:07:37.400> so<00:07:37.670> it's<00:07:37.970> not<00:07:38.180> just<00:07:38.240> a<00:07:38.510> fan

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690 
life span you fan so it's not just a fan

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.080 
life span you fan so it's not just a fan
it's<00:07:38.840> an<00:07:38.990> investment<00:07:39.260> if<00:07:39.680> you<00:07:39.830> were<00:07:40.030> like<00:07:41.030> I

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090 
it's an investment if you were like I

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.910 
it's an investment if you were like I
say<00:07:41.300> on<00:07:41.330> the<00:07:41.450> silent<00:07:41.840> wings<00:07:41.960> as<00:07:42.140> well<00:07:42.320> we've

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:42.920 
say on the silent wings as well we've

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.340 
say on the silent wings as well we've
got<00:07:42.950> the<00:07:43.220> rubber<00:07:43.760> interface<00:07:44.360> so<00:07:44.900> this<00:07:45.200> is

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.350 
got the rubber interface so this is

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.930 
got the rubber interface so this is
never<00:07:45.560> actually<00:07:45.740> just<00:07:46.070> plastic<00:07:46.430> on<00:07:46.610> your<00:07:46.640> case

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:46.940 
never actually just plastic on your case

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.000 
never actually just plastic on your case
it's<00:07:47.600> got<00:07:47.810> a<00:07:47.840> little<00:07:47.960> rubber<00:07:48.230> dampen<00:07:48.680> in<00:07:48.830> there

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.010 
it's got a little rubber dampen in there

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.500 
it's got a little rubber dampen in there
to<00:07:49.430> reduce<00:07:49.730> any<00:07:49.940> vibration

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
to reduce any vibration

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.570 
to reduce any vibration
nice<00:07:50.720> so<00:07:51.260> all<00:07:51.500> of<00:07:51.530> these<00:07:51.770> funds<00:07:52.040> are<00:07:52.220> set<00:07:52.370> up<00:07:52.490> on

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.580 
nice so all of these funds are set up on

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.250 
nice so all of these funds are set up on
our<00:07:52.700> website<00:07:53.090> they<00:07:53.270> are<00:07:53.360> available<00:07:53.900> now<00:07:53.930> this
