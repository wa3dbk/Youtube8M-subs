00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.079
 spring and the name of one of the models 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.269
 most famous in the history of the wasp 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.960
 because it is related to version 125 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.609
 launched in 1968 it has remained on the list 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.399
 for a good 14 years 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.710
 today November 2013 the spring wasp 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.360
 back in the range and a few days from his 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.199
 presentation of but we are in barcelona 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.199
 try it for you 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.310
 the new spring vespa draws in 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.040
 design some details of the wasp 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.930
 946 the top-of-the-range model it is 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.670
 entered the list in 2012 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.960
 the lines are slimmer than sultry installments of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.970
 those of the lx version 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.320
 the tail is more pointed and recalls the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.600
 past are very obvious 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.220
 the technique is known that pulls in 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.110
 printed steel sheet that made 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.600
 the luck of the wasp and the whole range 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.950
 of last generation travel engines 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.660
 four models proposed two 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.480
 fifty with a two or four engine 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.000
 times and branded versions of 125 150 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.830
 cubic centimeters both pushed by 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.050
 square engines or three valves capable of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.630
 ensure very low consumption with 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.560
 distances up to almost 50 km with a 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.119
 liter 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.810
 change the fork that received a 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.550
 new fixing system 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 of the shock absorber able to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.220
 improve the smoothness of the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.140
 Suspension 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.479
 the underseat compartment of the wasp is now more 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.910
 great because it has grown by a good 2.3 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 liters because the battery is no longer below 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.850
 the saddle but has been moved to the center 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.740
 of the frame in the central beam is also 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 changed the fixing device of the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 engine now through billets a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.280
 two degrees of freedom that allow the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.520
 engine not to transmit vibrations 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.520
 on the footboard on the saddle and on the handlebar 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.819
 on a spring vespa ergonomics is 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 perfect the saddle is close to the ground and the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.239
 compact size makes it a scooter 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.140
 suitable for all sizes as well as for 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.180
 female audience 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.769
 the instrumentation has a vintage look with 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.069
 the speedometer hand recalls 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.939
 that of the spring wasp of 1968 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.290
 flanked by a crystal display 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.969
 liquids with the odometer 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.780
 the clock is the level indicator 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.579
 fuel 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.889
 the guide of the spring wasp remembers 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.689
 that of the lex from which it descends now 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.040
 however driving dynamics is improved for 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.510
 via the front suspension plus 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.159
 sliding and thanks to the stiffer frame 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.079
 and with a lower center of gravity 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.519
 the performances are the same compared 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.590
 to the previous model that was pushed 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.689
 from the same engines but in fact now the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.859
 vibrations have practically disappeared 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.470
 pity the version is not available 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.470
 equipped with abs but is on the way 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.600
 the new spring wasp is already 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
 available in dealerships in six 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.100
 colors that recall more colors 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.790
 famous at the turn of the 60s and 70s 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.070
 prices are 2700 20 and 2820 euros 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.180
 respectively three versions 52 times and 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:35.400
 4 times and 3,700 euros and 3900 euros for the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.400
 versions 125 and 150 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.230
