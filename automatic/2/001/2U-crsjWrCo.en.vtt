tutorial on how to fix that with a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.410 
tutorial on how to fix that with a
program<00:00:43.739> known<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.780> DX<00:00:45.780> Tweaker<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.710> can

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
program known as DX Tweaker you can

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.459 
program known as DX Tweaker you can
basically<00:00:48.420> add<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:50.309> card<00:00:51.300> video<00:00:51.870> card<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
basically add in a card video card that

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.330 
basically add in a card video card that
you<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.520> computer<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.239> emulate<00:00:54.930> and

you want your computer to emulate and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.250 
you want your computer to emulate and
run<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> halo<00:00:57.449> program<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:01:00.260> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
run with the halo program so you can you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
run with the halo program so you can you
want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> navigate<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> folder<00:01:02.730> where

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
