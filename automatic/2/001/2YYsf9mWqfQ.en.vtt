00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
midsole and of course those really

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
midsole and of course those really
colorful<00:00:56.699> hits<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> outsole<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.840> nice

head but the playoff fates are the crew
mates<00:01:05.540> ultimately<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.689> decided<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.350> put<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
mates ultimately I decided to put the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.100 
mates ultimately I decided to put the
chromates<00:01:08.010> ahead<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> playoff<00:01:08.820> eights

because a I think the more slept on and
be<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> an<00:01:14.700> ice<00:01:14.970> cooler
