00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.439 

alright<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.739> we<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.009> here<00:00:17.519> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.970> nasty

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
alright what we have here is the nasty

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.499 
alright what we have here is the nasty
trick<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.409> is<00:00:19.619> basically<00:00:20.159> an<00:00:20.759> invention<00:00:21.179> I

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
trick this is basically an invention I

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.139 
trick this is basically an invention I
made<00:00:21.779> after<00:00:22.169> I<00:00:22.679> made<00:00:23.009> the<00:00:23.249> dirty<00:00:23.519> trick<00:00:23.909> and

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
made after I made the dirty trick and

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.259 
made after I made the dirty trick and
the<00:00:24.359> myths<00:00:24.599> nasty<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:26.009> is<00:00:26.220> basically<00:00:26.669> both

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the myths nasty this is basically both

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.259 
the myths nasty this is basically both
those<00:00:27.689> pedals<00:00:28.259> in<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.519> basically<00:00:29.999> you<00:00:30.119> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
those pedals in one so basically you can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
those pedals in one so basically you can
use<00:00:30.419> them<00:00:30.599> individually<00:00:31.040> like<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.309> have

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
use them individually like if you have

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
use them individually like if you have
both<00:00:32.670> the<00:00:32.880> pedals<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.320> them

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
both the pedals or you can use them

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
both the pedals or you can use them
together<00:00:34.650> which<00:00:35.130> basically<00:00:35.610> creates<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.690> whole

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
together which basically creates a whole

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
together which basically creates a whole
other<00:00:37.380> distortion<00:00:38.100> pedal<00:00:38.460> making<00:00:38.880> it<00:00:38.970> three

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
other distortion pedal making it three

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.350 
other distortion pedal making it three
distortions<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:42.030> they're

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
distortions and one because they're

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
distortions and one because they're
connected<00:00:42.810> in<00:00:42.930> parallel<00:00:42.960> rather<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
connected in parallel rather than in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.780 
connected in parallel rather than in
series<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:46.010> since<00:00:47.010> they're<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.280> parallel

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
series and since they're in parallel

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.870 
series and since they're in parallel
it's<00:00:47.970> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.240> like<00:00:48.360> having<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.900> preamps<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
it's kind of like having two preamps and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.760 
it's kind of like having two preamps and
the<00:00:50.880> signal<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.570> signal<00:00:51.960> goes<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the signal your signal goes through it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.569 
the signal your signal goes through it
at<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.700> rather<00:00:54.210> than<00:00:55.130> one<00:00:56.130> before

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
at the same time rather than one before

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
at the same time rather than one before
the<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.810> if<00:00:57.990> you<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.560> them

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the other as it would if you have them

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.770 
the other as it would if you have them
connected<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.280> series<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> basically<00:01:01.620> each

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
connected in series so basically each

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.209 
connected in series so basically each
distortion<00:01:03.780> sent<00:01:04.229> its<00:01:04.409> own<00:01:04.559> character<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
distortion sent its own character and

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.929 
distortion sent its own character and
new<00:01:06.179> Harmonix<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.079> aren't<00:01:07.289> present<00:01:07.759> like<00:01:08.759> if

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
new Harmonix that aren't present like if

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
new Harmonix that aren't present like if
you<00:01:09.030> use<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.539> at<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.749> time<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.499> you<00:01:10.590> use

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you use them one at a time when you use

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.349 
you use them one at a time when you use
them<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.520> basically<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.060> whole

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
them together it's basically a whole

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.779 
them together it's basically a whole
different<00:01:12.780> tone<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.289> distortion<00:01:13.859> getting

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
different tone of distortion getting

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.550 
different tone of distortion getting
character<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:15.420> both<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> distortions<00:01:16.409> at

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
character from both the distortions at

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.849 
character from both the distortions at
once<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:18.659> completely<00:01:18.929> usable<00:01:19.530> all

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
once and it's completely usable all

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.499 
once and it's completely usable all
three<00:01:20.100> distortions<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.759> usable<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.329> don't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
three distortions are usable you don't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
three distortions are usable you don't
get<00:01:21.719> feedback<00:01:22.259> an<00:01:22.469> extra<00:01:22.799> noise<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.999> would

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
get feedback an extra noise as you would

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.809 
get feedback an extra noise as you would
if<00:01:24.359> they<00:01:24.509> were<00:01:24.539> in<00:01:24.780> series<00:01:25.289> one<00:01:26.069> pre<00:01:26.429> amping

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
if they were in series one pre amping

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.029 
if they were in series one pre amping
into<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.179> next<00:01:27.479> which<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.869> basically<00:01:28.109> get

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
into the next which would basically get

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.949 
into the next which would basically get
a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.399> overwhelming<00:01:30.209> and<00:01:30.420> create<00:01:30.749> all

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
a little overwhelming and create all

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.580 
a little overwhelming and create all
kinds<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.380> unwanted<00:01:31.799> noise<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> feedback

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
kinds of unwanted noise and feedback

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.749 
kinds of unwanted noise and feedback
here<00:01:35.539> you<00:01:36.539> turn<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.009> dirty<00:01:38.280> trick

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
here you turn on and off the dirty trick

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.849 
here you turn on and off the dirty trick
distortion<00:01:39.569> and<00:01:41.719> here<00:01:42.719> you<00:01:42.899> control<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
distortion and here you control all the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:49.940 
distortion and here you control all the
power<00:01:45.049> meters<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> dirty<00:01:46.920> trick<00:01:48.950> here's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
power meters of the dirty trick here's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
power meters of the dirty trick here's
your<00:01:50.039> volume<00:01:50.639> here's<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.090> tone<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.749> here's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
your volume here's your tone and here's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
your volume here's your tone and here's
your<00:01:52.770> game<00:01:54.049> here<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.259> turn<00:01:55.469> it<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:55.859> off

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
your game here you turn it on and off

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.339 
your game here you turn it on and off
over<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.299> side<00:01:57.359> you<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:57.959> mist

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
over on this side you have the mist

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.679 
over on this side you have the mist
nasty<00:01:58.920> distortion<00:01:59.549> turn<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.599> off

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
nasty distortion turn it on and off

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
nasty distortion turn it on and off
right<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.469> control<00:02:01.889> it<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.279> here

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
right here and you control it up here

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.539 
right here and you control it up here
volume<00:02:03.119> tone<00:02:03.389> and<00:02:03.689> game<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> have

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
volume tone and game so when you have

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.849 
volume tone and game so when you have
them<00:02:05.670> both<00:02:05.880> engaged<00:02:06.389> at<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.749> same<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:07.259> this

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
them both engaged at the same time this

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.570 
them both engaged at the same time this
is<00:02:08.069> where<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> becomes<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.910> nasty<00:02:09.509> trick

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
is where it becomes the nasty trick

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.320 
is where it becomes the nasty trick
combination<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.820> two<00:02:12.000> distortions

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
combination of the two distortions

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.230 
combination of the two distortions
and<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.990> control<00:02:14.440> all<00:02:14.800> six<00:02:15.760> knobs<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and here you control all six knobs to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.810 
and here you control all six knobs to
get<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.630> tone<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.050> want<00:02:17.080> basically<00:02:17.820> so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
get the tone you want basically so

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.080 
get the tone you want basically so
that's<00:02:18.970> basically<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.780> pedal<00:02:20.140> explain

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
that's basically this pedal explain

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.730 
that's basically this pedal explain
basically<00:02:22.090> has<00:02:22.390> all<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.900> same<00:02:23.140> tone<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.710> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
basically has all the same tone in the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.340 
basically has all the same tone in the
dirty<00:02:24.010> tricking<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> mist<00:02:24.880> nasty<00:02:25.360> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.720 
now let's try out the dirty tricks side
of<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> pedal<00:03:35.440> let's<00:03:36.440> go<00:03:36.680> start<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.550> the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
of the pedal let's go start with the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:49.910 
of the pedal let's go start with the
tone<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.720> gain<00:03:38.930> at<00:03:39.170> zero

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.830 

you<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.070> see<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.400> basically<00:03:51.700> goes<00:03:51.970> from<00:03:52.210> clean

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:11.600

alright<00:04:12.610> let's<00:04:12.760> put<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> little<00:04:13.120> more<00:04:13.330> gain

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
alright let's put a little more gain

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.250 
alright let's put a little more gain
halfway<00:04:14.200> or<00:04:14.349> so<00:04:18.359> notice<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.510> clarity<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.109> all

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
halfway or so notice the clarity and all

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.670 

that's<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.420> gain<00:04:37.600> half<00:04:37.870> let's<00:04:38.140> put<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.530> up<00:04:38.620> to

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
that's the gain half let's put it up to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:50.820 
that's the gain half let's put it up to
about<00:04:38.920> three<00:04:39.280> o'clock

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830

side of the nasty trick sorry let's go
from<00:05:25.599> zero<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:29.800> can<00:05:29.860> see<00:05:30.069> this<00:05:30.250> one<00:05:30.460> doesn't

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
from zero you can see this one doesn't

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.490 
from zero you can see this one doesn't
go<00:05:30.849> from<00:05:31.120> clean<00:05:31.360> there's<00:05:31.599> a<00:05:31.690> little<00:05:31.870> bit<00:05:32.289> more

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
compressed Sony all right now let's try

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:11.760 
compressed Sony all right now let's try
both<00:06:10.749> of<00:06:10.960> them<00:06:11.050> together<00:06:11.169> which<00:06:11.620> are

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
both of them together which are

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.679 
both of them together which are
connected<00:06:12.039> in<00:06:12.310> parallel<00:06:12.370> so<00:06:13.210> we'll<00:06:13.539> got<00:06:13.659> a

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
connected in parallel so we'll got a

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.050 
connected in parallel so we'll got a
little<00:06:13.900> character<00:06:14.289> from<00:06:14.590> both<00:06:14.830> this<00:06:15.550> kind<00:06:15.939> of

little character from both this kind of

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.629 
little character from both this kind of
to<00:06:16.270> me<00:06:16.479> seems<00:06:17.139> more<00:06:17.379> of<00:06:17.499> like<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:18.400> dirty

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
to me seems more of like a the dirty

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.670 
to me seems more of like a the dirty
trick<00:06:18.939> as<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> lower<00:06:19.389> game<00:06:19.719> the<00:06:20.020> myths<00:06:20.229> Nazis

kind<00:06:20.919> of<00:06:20.979> a<00:06:21.069> higher<00:06:21.340> gain<00:06:21.699> and<00:06:21.909> then<00:06:22.029> with<00:06:22.210> both

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
kind of a higher gain and then with both

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.909 
kind of a higher gain and then with both
home<00:06:22.629> together<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:23.139> kind<00:06:23.379> of<00:06:23.439> create<00:06:23.710> like<00:06:23.889> a

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.279 
home together you kind of create like a
mid<00:06:24.279> game<00:06:24.520> level<00:06:24.969> kind<00:06:25.810> of<00:06:25.900> gets<00:06:26.050> a<00:06:26.139> little

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
mid game level kind of gets a little

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:46.510 
mid game level kind of gets a little
character<00:06:26.680> from<00:06:26.979> both<00:06:27.189> at<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:27.490> same<00:06:27.669> time

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.620 

when<00:06:47.520> you<00:06:47.580> got<00:06:47.730> both<00:06:47.940> of<00:06:47.970> the<00:06:48.210> same<00:06:48.419> time

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
when you got both of the same time

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.650 
when you got both of the same time
convincing<00:06:49.020> control<00:06:49.950> all<00:06:50.130> six<00:06:50.550> knobs<00:06:50.880> and<00:06:51.300> see

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
convincing control all six knobs and see

00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:43.070 
convincing control all six knobs and see
what<00:06:51.840> you<00:06:51.960> get

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.330 

as<00:07:44.080> you<00:07:44.230> can<00:07:44.320> see<00:07:44.470> when<00:07:44.620> they're<00:07:44.740> both<00:07:44.890> on<00:07:44.950> you

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
as you can see when they're both on you

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.720 
as you can see when they're both on you
got<00:07:45.520> harmonics<00:07:46.120> from<00:07:46.330> both<00:07:46.570> and<00:07:47.730> that's

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.730 
got harmonics from both and that's

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:57.879 
got harmonics from both and that's
basically<00:07:49.030> the<00:07:49.390> nasty<00:07:49.960> trick

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:57.889 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:59.949 

you
