the<00:02:42.410> grid<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.300> video<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the grid to the video so you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.520 
the grid to the video so you
automatically<00:02:45.950> made<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> copy<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:48.320> data

video source or preview we just link

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.780 
video source or preview we just link
that<00:03:00.560> same<00:03:00.860> way<00:03:01.040> by<00:03:01.190> dragging<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.550> dropping

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
that same way by dragging and dropping

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.530 
that same way by dragging and dropping
linking<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> stage<00:03:03.200> component<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
linking the stage component to the

now<00:03:08.810> our<00:03:08.840> two<00:03:09.200> views<00:03:09.530> are<00:03:09.680> set<00:03:09.980> up<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:13.330> have<00:03:14.330> some

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
now our two views are set up I have some

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.200 
now our two views are set up I have some
short<00:03:15.320> JavaScript<00:03:16.070> code<00:03:16.310> here<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.000> will

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
short JavaScript code here that will

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.450 
short JavaScript code here that will
toggle<00:03:17.950> between<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.340> two<00:03:19.550> views<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:21.370> want<00:03:22.370> to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
toggle between the two views so want to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.620 
toggle between the two views so want to
go<00:03:22.610> into<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.330> javascript<00:03:24.020> file<00:03:25.240> just<00:03:26.240> paste

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
go into the javascript file just paste

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.180 
go into the javascript file just paste
that<00:03:28.000> function<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.150> here<00:03:29.950> toggle<00:03:30.950> stack

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
that function in here toggle stack

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.960 
that function in here toggle stack
layout<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.540> we'll<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:32.900> go<00:03:33.110> between<00:03:33.590> the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
layout and we'll just go between the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.940 
layout and we'll just go between the
details<00:03:34.970> view<00:03:35.390> which<00:03:36.140> contains<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.740> great

I'll call that same behavior or method

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.770 
I'll call that same behavior or method
which<00:04:25.820> will<00:04:25.970> give<00:04:26.090> us<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.270> behavior

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
which will give us that behavior

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
which will give us that behavior
toggling<00:04:27.350> between<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.800> two<00:04:27.980> views<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.490> will

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
toggling between the two views that will

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.960 
toggling between the two views that will
apply<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.260> standard<00:04:30.280> sliding<00:04:31.280> behavior<00:04:31.850> that
