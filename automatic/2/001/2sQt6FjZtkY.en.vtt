like Carmelo if he wanted to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
like Carmelo if he wanted to
he's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> better<00:00:41.850> assist<00:00:42.270> guy<00:00:42.450> he's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> better

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
he's a better assist guy he's a better

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
he's a better assist guy he's a better
defender<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.430> times<00:00:44.670> he's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> better

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I think Carmelo Anthony is a bet if I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.959 
I think Carmelo Anthony is a bet if I
have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> give<00:00:49.920> Carmelo<00:00:50.250> Anthony<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.730> thing

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
he has a better arsenal I think he gets

tough<00:00:54.930> -<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.530> he's<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> better<00:00:55.890> shooter

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tough - I think he's a better shooter
