literally<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.450> mean<00:03:31.750> that's<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.110> fresh<00:03:32.350> off

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
literally I mean that's just fresh off

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.039 
literally I mean that's just fresh off
the<00:03:32.769> saw<00:03:32.980> that's<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.880> fresh<00:03:34.120> split<00:03:34.450> billet<00:03:34.870> this

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the saw that's a fresh split billet this

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.380 
the saw that's a fresh split billet this
is<00:03:35.200> literally<00:03:35.530> where<00:03:35.860> they<00:03:36.070> start<00:03:36.400> from<00:03:36.580> and

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
is literally where they start from and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.120 
is literally where they start from and
of<00:03:37.600> course<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.930> scroll<00:03:38.230> just<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.799> block<00:03:39.100> of

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
of course the scroll just is a block of

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.550 
of course the scroll just is a block of
wood<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:39.790> cut<00:03:40.030> roughly<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.570> shape<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.410> get

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
wood that's cut roughly to shape to get

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.979 
wood that's cut roughly to shape to get
it<00:03:41.650> started<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.160> then<00:03:42.549> as<00:03:42.850> things<00:03:43.660> get

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
it started and then as things get

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.140 
it started and then as things get
working<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.040> what<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.519> start<00:03:45.790> turning

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
working this is what will start turning

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.800 
working this is what will start turning
into<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:47.170> ribcage<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.830> built<00:03:48.070> from<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:49.180> very

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
into the ribcage is built from just very

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.410 
into the ribcage is built from just very
thin<00:03:50.019> slices<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.590> 2<00:03:50.860> millimeter<00:03:51.310> wood<00:03:52.090> and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
thin slices of 2 millimeter wood and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.300 
thin slices of 2 millimeter wood and
they're<00:03:52.630> bent<00:03:52.840> around<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.230> form<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.130> get<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
they're bent around the form to get the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.490 
they're bent around the form to get the
outline<00:03:54.610> in<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> shape<00:03:55.269> once<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.350> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
outline in the shape once I get the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.830 
outline in the shape once I get the
outline<00:03:56.680> then<00:03:57.610> I'm<00:03:57.850> able<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.150> cut<00:03:58.360> out<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> top

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
outline then I'm able to cut out the top

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.330 
outline then I'm able to cut out the top
and<00:03:58.900> back<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> pattern<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.220> start

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
and back to the pattern and start

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.880 
and back to the pattern and start
working<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.910> top<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.330> back<00:04:01.450> plates<00:04:01.890> varnish

working the top and back plates varnish

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.430 
working the top and back plates varnish
has<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> huge<00:04:03.760> impact<00:04:04.120> on<00:04:04.330> sound<00:04:04.690> varnish<00:04:05.260> can

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
has a huge impact on sound varnish can

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.780 
has a huge impact on sound varnish can
do<00:04:05.560> three<00:04:05.769> things<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.400> make<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:06.640> sound

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
do three things it can make it sound

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.490 
do three things it can make it sound
better<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.269> can<00:04:07.390> make<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.630> sound<00:04:07.810> worse<00:04:08.080> or<00:04:08.440> it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
better it can make it sound worse or it

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.620 
better it can make it sound worse or it
can<00:04:08.590> make<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.830> sound<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.070> same<00:04:09.630> ultimately

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
can make it sound the same ultimately

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.710 
can make it sound the same ultimately
that's<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.680> model<00:04:11.890> line<00:04:12.220> ideally<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.360> violin

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
that's the model line ideally the violin

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's the model line ideally the violin
sounds<00:04:14.019> best<00:04:14.260> with<00:04:14.500> nothing<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.040> because

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
sounds best with nothing on it because

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.830 
sounds best with nothing on it because
anything<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.760> put<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.330> is<00:04:16.419> gonna<00:04:16.600> start

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
anything you put on it is gonna start

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.479 
anything you put on it is gonna start
dampening<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.440> vibrations<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.250> it's<00:04:18.370> gonna

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
dampening the vibrations and it's gonna

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.789 
dampening the vibrations and it's gonna
start<00:04:18.729> dampening<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.269> sound<00:04:19.540> but<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> sense

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
start dampening the sound but in a sense

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.550 
start dampening the sound but in a sense
I<00:04:21.010> kind<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.310> wanted<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:22.750> know<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> rawness

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
I kind of wanted you know the rawness

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.620 
I kind of wanted you know the rawness
the<00:04:23.800> overtones<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.550> kind<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> gives<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.419> raw

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
the overtones it kind of gives it a raw

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.690 
the overtones it kind of gives it a raw
edginess<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.350> wanted<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:26.830> tone<00:04:27.070> down<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.580> so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
edginess I wanted that tone down and so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.100 
edginess I wanted that tone down and so
I<00:04:27.729> actually<00:04:27.910> got<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.450> effect<00:04:28.780> on<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
I actually got that effect on the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.610 
I actually got that effect on the
it<00:04:29.950> was<00:04:30.040> nice<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.400> see<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.580> happen<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
it was nice to see that happen if you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.740 
it was nice to see that happen if you
want<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.920> hear<00:04:33.130> Dorian<00:04:33.550> Barnes<00:04:33.940> violence<00:04:34.450> in
