00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
making this series and it felt a bit

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
making this series and it felt a bit
laborious<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.070> really

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
laborious and when you're not really

enjoying making a youtube series it's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
enjoying making a youtube series it's
not<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.500> worth<00:00:40.710> continuing<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> hope

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the first two strikes are used were

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.229 
the first two strikes are used were
Mario<00:00:57.030> Balotelli<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> Dimitar<00:00:58.559> Berbatov<00:00:59.239> now

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
Mario Balotelli and Dimitar Berbatov now

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I think it's quite funny that Balotelli

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
I think it's quite funny that Balotelli
was<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.699> my<00:01:02.850> favorite<00:01:03.149> striker<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
was actually my favorite striker that I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050

used throughout the game as you can see

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in 10 games he got 22 goals which is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.179 
in 10 games he got 22 goals which is
absolutely<00:01:09.330> incredible<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.229> I'll<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.010> to

three<00:03:43.780> strikers<00:03:44.230> from<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.829> series<00:03:45.220> I'll

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
three strikers from the series I'll

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.879 
three strikers from the series I'll
countdown<00:03:45.910> now<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.599> third<00:03:46.989> position<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.680> have

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
countdown now in third position I have

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.729 
countdown now in third position I have
Jones<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.639> second<00:03:49.540> position<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:50.079> have<00:03:50.290> Carol

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
Jones in second position I have Carol

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.430 
Jones in second position I have Carol
and<00:03:51.099> in<00:03:51.400> first<00:03:51.609> place<00:03:51.790> rather<00:03:52.540> ironically<00:03:53.199> the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
and in first place rather ironically the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.559 
and in first place rather ironically the
first<00:03:53.470> striker<00:03:54.069> who<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.370> tried<00:03:54.730> Mario

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
first striker who I tried Mario

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.289 
first striker who I tried Mario
Balotelli<00:03:56.319> so<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.430> really<00:03:57.669> concludes<00:03:58.180> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
Balotelli so that really concludes the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.059 
Balotelli so that really concludes the
series<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.870> thought<00:03:59.079> balotelli<00:03:59.650> was<00:03:59.769> the

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
series I thought balotelli was the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.069 
series I thought balotelli was the
perfect<00:04:00.489> strike<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.389> Premier<00:04:01.750> League<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
perfect strike in the Premier League and

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.439 
perfect strike in the Premier League and
I<00:04:02.379> hope<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.799> guys<00:04:03.159> enjoyed<00:04:03.699> the<00:04:03.879> series<00:04:04.239> with
