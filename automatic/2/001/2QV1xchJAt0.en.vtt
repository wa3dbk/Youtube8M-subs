00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello channel with you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.210
 rabbit pit today we talk about the very 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 the easiest way to breeding 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.000
 rabbits even so directly say not 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 breeding and growing this way well 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.730
 because why we grow because 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.500
 we 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 we will not breed rabbits 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.060
 grow already ready for whom this way 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.870
 suit suitable for those who are in the first place 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 just wants to start practicing 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.500
 leadership 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 not yet confident in my abilities and wants 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.149
 try without much investment 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 labor costs who else can he approach 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.870
 but summer residents to shareholders who are on one 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.260
 season 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.149
 when to try this light version 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.949
 rabbit breeding 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.489
 here in this cage you can feed 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.680
 somewhere 3 baby rabbits they need to be given 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.240
 somewhere at least twice a day is better 3 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 shout you must have one semi 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.900
 otherwise you will need two cells but 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.759
 zagonchik just do not get attached to them 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 don't give them names remember then you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.890
 will have to eat them do not concern 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.549
 pet blades it's just 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.040
 the meat we want we take ready how to find 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.960
 small and easy and you have a season on 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 to dig up 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 but with this method of course my big 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.880
 profits don't get much color not 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 take but at least we get 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 pleasure recycle the grass which 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.130
 we have us here well be honest and we will 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 free dung end of season 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.259
 and its dietary meat its 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.460
 rabbit but its last to bal 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.509
 weighting agent preservatives and y for 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.509
 this will require a minimum of labor real 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.509
 of knowledge 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.390
 This is such a light version if you 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.520
 like it and you want to do it 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:28.330
 more seriously but we are on the block page 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.870
 there will be posted material and others 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.570
 types of material here spread edge 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.230
 more seriously, I myself breed rabbit 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.230
 pits 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.489
 various information can be found there 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.500
 breeding rabbits if you want 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.540
 do it more seriously have you 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.540
 involve explicit feeder method then 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.310
 but for now let's take the easiest way 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.159
 cultivation is ready to go we do not need 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.180
 know anything about the grooves arrange 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:11.180
 queens most difficult is to take 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.099
 okrol stole and grow a doctor from a lady 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.930
 after a month knows the market of the army and everything 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.629
 places for the cell need to find such a place 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.919
 as little as possible sun rays fall 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:27.310
 rabbits do not tolerate heat like we 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.169
 do we buy ready rabbits 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.510
 just do accept the outer cage 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.299
 in his summer cottage grass 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.669
 all the same we have them for several months 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.049
 growing out here will affect tribute 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:46.849
 Well, rabbits, they melt 300 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:50.109
 rubles well and for this money even for might 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.229
 remove it can buy wakelock street 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.909
 shop well first this shop 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.189
 rings on their own is of course not 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.389
 compare secondly so tricky 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.810
 way to sell 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.040
 you can negotiate with those who 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.200
 rabbits grows 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.780
 who has the uterus market sankyo 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.280
 heat up to take rabbits for fattening 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.320
 to fattening from how to fattening it means you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.289
 take 10 doctors from him 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.209
 over whom to feed and and he surrenders 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.789
 half of you pocket ie five 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.669
 execute again you except on leave 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:31.860
 Well here it turns out in money 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.919
 practically do not spend only 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.310
 your work because it will feed 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.919
 all that you have growing on the site 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.160
 different weed so that the branches 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.699
 trimmed well, and you can buy a little 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.800
 feed ok or barley or oats or 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.840
 barley or that it is you there 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 Bikor is such a special 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.800
 balanced rabbit food 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:06.510
 is it sold in markets or 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.330
 specialty stores one rabbit 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.400
 eats per day somewhere on average around 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.630
 100 grams of feed depending on 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.020
 age rabbit is fine and 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.860
 pig feed means like we 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.250
 make a knee 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:29.380
 the simplest way is reward 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:32.760
 crown of anything enough 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:40.090
 so that one kind of wall was him 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.560
 Conversations 1 kids make a reason for sex I 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.460
 I recommend to make sure of 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.920
 plastic and plastic arrange a little bit 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.560
 when on the field because it's easy to clean 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.580
 easy to wash and the blood will urinate for an hour 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:00.250
 will drain run off and go to the ground 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.320
 on earth for power you will rake 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.060
 minimum manure should be broken 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.060
 rake because otherwise 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.800
 discovery of such a blood disorder they 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.880
 they have development cycles for weeks therefore 1 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.020
 week necessarily manure on tuber 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.210
 Here we did there and zagonchik 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.560
 to ask 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.070
 we cover it with a lid just ordinary 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.320
 plywood and put the bottle does not strand 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.080
 will run away if full did he landed 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.960
 can dig and run away rollers 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.510
 digging do very well but set 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.340
 here are the plates 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.500
 little plates with some water are required 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.510
 will appear on this crown one of 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.460
 feed because a rabbit is one 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.010
 grass memory you are not about mishon 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.590
 granivorous 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:54.340
 here and throw weed apples can throw 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.440
 what we are well and weed all that 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.710
 growing almost everything that grows on 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.160
 fate strawberry raspberry pruning 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:07.889
 when we cut all this role goes to 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:11.470
 only plum branches are not suitable 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:17.130
 cherries but any stone fruit tops 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:21.340
 tomato or potato and wild grapes 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:26.460
 you can give cultivated grapes if 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:30.639
 more detail you want to know about the rabbit 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:34.139
 again my site is a rabbit 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:37.590
 targets in the pit . 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.710
 go there read about the explicit method 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.990
 or 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.159
 wait for the video you can subscribe to 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:50.580
