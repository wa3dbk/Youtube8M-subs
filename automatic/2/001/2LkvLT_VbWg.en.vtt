today with Chi and we are working on the
rotator<00:00:14.360> discs<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.169> this<00:00:15.349> is<00:00:15.499> part<00:00:15.739> of<00:00:15.829> the

rotator discs so this is part of the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.340 
rotator discs so this is part of the
series<00:00:16.219> focusing<00:00:17.150> specifically<00:00:17.750> on<00:00:17.900> working

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
series focusing specifically on working

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.820 
series focusing specifically on working
with<00:00:18.500> dancers<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:20.260> one<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:21.440> things<00:00:21.680> we

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
with dancers and one of the things we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.430 
with dancers and one of the things we
want<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:22.070> work<00:00:22.250> on<00:00:22.430> is<00:00:22.700> balance<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:23.600> really

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
want to work on is balance and really

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.560 
want to work on is balance and really
working<00:00:24.710> from<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.220> top<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:25.910> hips

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
working from the top of the hips

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.230 
working from the top of the hips
anytime<00:00:27.380> you're<00:00:27.710> rotating<00:00:28.190> through<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.970> legs

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
anytime you're rotating through the legs

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.040 
anytime you're rotating through the legs
or<00:00:29.740> working<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.830> turn<00:00:31.220> or<00:00:31.760> working<00:00:32.119> promenade

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
or working a turn or working promenade

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.610 
or working a turn or working promenade
so<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.070> discs<00:00:34.760> are<00:00:34.969> a<00:00:34.999> very<00:00:35.359> unstable<00:00:35.839> surface

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
so the discs are a very unstable surface

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.310 
so the discs are a very unstable surface
and<00:00:37.010> they<00:00:37.190> move<00:00:38.089> very<00:00:38.120> easily<00:00:38.420> under<00:00:39.170> your

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
and they move very easily under your

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.759 
and they move very easily under your
feet<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:41.030> lot<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.510> times<00:00:41.749> dancers<00:00:42.350> sort<00:00:42.679> of

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
feet so a lot of times dancers sort of

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.680 
feet so a lot of times dancers sort of
stick<00:00:43.159> their<00:00:43.370> feet<00:00:43.579> into<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.089> ground<00:00:44.359> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
stick their feet into the ground and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.349 
stick their feet into the ground and
then<00:00:44.839> twist<00:00:45.409> from<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.010> knee<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.550> what<00:00:47.149> ends

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
then twist from the knee and what ends

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.020 
then twist from the knee and what ends
up<00:00:47.420> happening<00:00:47.479> is<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.289> lot<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.829> torsion<00:00:49.699> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
up happening is a lot of torsion and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.079 
up happening is a lot of torsion and
pain<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.319> the<00:00:51.440> knee<00:00:51.649> joint<00:00:51.940> because<00:00:52.940> they're

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
pain in the knee joint because they're

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.660 
pain in the knee joint because they're
not<00:00:53.269> really<00:00:53.690> working<00:00:53.899> from<00:00:54.229> the<00:00:54.379> hip<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:55.429> nice

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
not really working from the hip the nice

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.579 
not really working from the hip the nice
thing<00:00:56.030> when<00:00:56.389> we're<00:00:56.600> working<00:00:56.719> on<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.170> rotator

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
thing when we're working on the rotator

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.189 
thing when we're working on the rotator
discs<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:59.089> rotator<00:00:59.479> discs<00:00:59.899> won't

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
discs is that the rotator discs won't

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.229 
discs is that the rotator discs won't
move<00:01:00.440> unless<00:01:00.979> you<00:01:01.309> are<00:01:01.489> actually<00:01:01.789> working

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
move unless you are actually working

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.570 
move unless you are actually working
from<00:01:02.690> your<00:01:02.989> hip<00:01:03.379> joint<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.129> proper

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
from your hip joint and the proper

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.150 
from your hip joint and the proper
musculature<00:01:05.089> in<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.960> external<00:01:06.410> rotators<00:01:07.130> of

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
musculature in the external rotators of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.180 
musculature in the external rotators of
the<00:01:07.430> hip<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.840> I'm<00:01:08.960> going<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:09.350> Kai<00:01:09.710> just

first and you're just gonna go with
straight<00:01:13.940> legs<00:01:14.380> internal<00:01:15.380> rotation<00:01:15.800> and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
straight legs internal rotation and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.210 
straight legs internal rotation and
external<00:01:17.390> rotation<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.320> what<00:01:18.890> I'm<00:01:19.010> watching

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
external rotation and what I'm watching

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.910 
external rotation and what I'm watching
for<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:20.120> that<00:01:20.390> she's<00:01:20.600> really<00:01:20.680> working<00:01:21.680> from

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
for is that she's really working from

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.760 
for is that she's really working from
the<00:01:22.100> top<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.940> femur<00:01:23.210> bone<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.500> wanna

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
the top of the femur bone and you wanna

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.030 
the top of the femur bone and you wanna
see<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.430> pelvis<00:01:25.940> stay<00:01:26.210> nice<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.450> stable<00:01:27.230> you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
see the pelvis stay nice and stable you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.320 
see the pelvis stay nice and stable you
want<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.310> watch<00:01:28.460> for<00:01:28.490> any<00:01:28.850> compensation

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
want to watch for any compensation

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.540 
want to watch for any compensation
patterns<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.350> back<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.220> she's

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
patterns in the back so that she's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.730 
patterns in the back so that she's
staying<00:01:31.820> nice<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.060> neutral<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.900> lifted

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
staying nice and neutral and lifted

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.220 
staying nice and neutral and lifted
through<00:01:33.950> her<00:01:34.100> core<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.750> femur

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
through her core and then the femur

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.050 
through her core and then the femur
bones<00:01:36.440> are<00:01:36.620> just<00:01:36.650> spinning<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.580> sockets

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
bones are just spinning in the sockets

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.050 
bones are just spinning in the sockets
so<00:01:38.660> there's<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.930> nice<00:01:39.200> free<00:01:39.770> sensation<00:01:40.580> going

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
so there's a nice free sensation going

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.050 
so there's a nice free sensation going
on<00:01:41.180> in<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.450> hips<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:43.670> we'll<00:01:43.850> take<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
on in the hips and then we'll take it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.750 
on in the hips and then we'll take it
into<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.480> plie<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.950> go<00:01:46.100> ahead<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.310> bend<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
into a plie so go ahead and bend the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.480 
into a plie so go ahead and bend the
knees<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.600> from<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.860> hips<00:01:49.070> she's<00:01:49.370> gonna

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
knees and from the hips she's gonna

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.960 
knees and from the hips she's gonna
rotate<00:01:49.900> parallel<00:01:51.310> standing<00:01:52.310> into<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.730> feet

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
rotate parallel standing into the feet

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.210 
rotate parallel standing into the feet
to<00:01:53.180> straighten<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.810> again<00:01:54.470> turnout<00:01:54.860> from<00:01:55.040> the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
to straighten and again turnout from the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.540 
to straighten and again turnout from the
hips<00:01:55.720> plie<00:01:57.940> turning<00:01:58.940> parallel<00:01:59.690> and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
hips plie turning parallel and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.190 
hips plie turning parallel and
straighten<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:01.730> again<00:02:02.390> plie

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
straighten and again plie

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.510 
straighten and again plie
bend<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.280> knees<00:02:04.490> turn<00:02:05.390> parallel<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.530> stretch

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
bend the knees turn parallel and stretch

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.880 
bend the knees turn parallel and stretch
and<00:02:08.060> she<00:02:08.300> can<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.599> a<00:02:08.629> variety<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.349> things<00:02:09.440> with

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
and she can do a variety of things with

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.490 
and she can do a variety of things with
her<00:02:10.039> arms<00:02:10.550> she<00:02:10.910> can<00:02:11.330> work<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.720> both<00:02:11.750> directions

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
her arms she can work in both directions

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.100 
her arms she can work in both directions
so<00:02:13.250> Kai<00:02:13.430> go<00:02:13.580> ahead<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.790> change<00:02:14.030> directions

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so Kai go ahead and change directions

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.290 
so Kai go ahead and change directions
hmm<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.370> again<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:18.580> watching<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.270> that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
hmm and again you're watching for that

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.990 
hmm and again you're watching for that
neutral<00:02:20.050> pelvis<00:02:20.440> position<00:02:20.980> lifting<00:02:21.790> up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
neutral pelvis position lifting up

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.550 
neutral pelvis position lifting up
through<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.330> pelvic<00:02:22.750> floor<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> low

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
through the pelvic floor in the low

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.190 
through the pelvic floor in the low
belly<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> there's<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.000> nice<00:02:25.210> openness<00:02:25.990> in

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
belly so that there's a nice openness in

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.110 
belly so that there's a nice openness in
the<00:02:26.320> low<00:02:26.530> back<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.490> don't<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.880> any<00:02:28.000> of

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the low back and you don't see any of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.230 
the low back and you don't see any of
that<00:02:28.240> rib<00:02:28.690> flaring<00:02:29.320> or<00:02:29.590> shoulder<00:02:30.040> elevation

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
that rib flaring or shoulder elevation

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.520 
that rib flaring or shoulder elevation
going<00:02:31.240> on<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.570> now<00:02:34.720> we've<00:02:34.930> changed<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
going on so now we've changed to a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.650 
going on so now we've changed to a
larger<00:02:36.160> disc<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:37.090> work

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
larger disc to work

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.980 
larger disc to work
promenade<00:02:38.440> series<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.460> working<00:02:40.390> pirouettes

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
promenade series and working pirouettes

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.040 
promenade series and working pirouettes
so<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.070> smaller<00:02:42.370> discs<00:02:42.850> are<00:02:42.970> nice<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.870> that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so the smaller discs are nice so that

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.630 
so the smaller discs are nice so that
you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.350> get<00:02:44.530> into<00:02:44.710> more<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.400> first

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
you can get into more of a first

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.600 
you can get into more of a first
position<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.360> get<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.600> heels<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.290> touch<00:02:47.610> with

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
position and get the heels to touch with

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.050 
position and get the heels to touch with
the<00:02:48.790> feet<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.360> center<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> disc<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the feet in the center of the disc and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060 
the feet in the center of the disc and
when<00:02:52.060> she<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.570> moving<00:02:52.900> into<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.440> single<00:02:53.890> leg

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
when she is moving into more single leg

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.250 
when she is moving into more single leg
and<00:02:54.310> promenade<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.970> want<00:02:55.180> more<00:02:55.420> room<00:02:55.930> for<00:02:56.170> her

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
and promenade we want more room for her

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.000 
and promenade we want more room for her
foot<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.890> since<00:02:57.760> she's<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> single<00:02:58.810> leg<00:02:59.020> she

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
foot and since she's on a single leg she

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.410 
foot and since she's on a single leg she
can<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.340> plant<00:03:00.610> her<00:03:00.760> foot<00:03:01.000> right<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
can just plant her foot right in the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.750 
can just plant her foot right in the
center<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> disc<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.680> move<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.070> around<00:03:03.160> so

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
center of the disc and move it around so

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.310 
center of the disc and move it around so
Chi<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.630> gonna<00:03:04.960> stand<00:03:05.350> up<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.400> disc<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
Chi is gonna stand up on to the disc and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.260 
Chi is gonna stand up on to the disc and
when<00:03:08.320> we're<00:03:08.710> working<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.280> promenade<00:03:09.820> go<00:03:10.120> and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
when we're working in a promenade go and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.240 
when we're working in a promenade go and
bring<00:03:10.360> your<00:03:10.480> arms<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:10.990> side<00:03:11.320> we<00:03:12.220> really

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
bring your arms up to the side we really

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.930 
bring your arms up to the side we really
want<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.240> leading<00:03:13.570> from<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> heel<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:15.670> as

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
want to be leading from the heel so as

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.480 
want to be leading from the heel so as
she<00:03:16.300> turns<00:03:16.600> around<00:03:16.810> she's<00:03:17.440> really<00:03:17.770> wrapping

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
she turns around she's really wrapping

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.410 
she turns around she's really wrapping
the<00:03:19.120> top<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.810> femur<00:03:20.080> around<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.430> working

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
the top of the femur around and working

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
the top of the femur around and working
the<00:03:22.720> turnout<00:03:23.200> from<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> top<00:03:23.770> of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.070> hip

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
the turnout from the top of the hip

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.470 
the turnout from the top of the hip
again<00:03:25.270> scooting<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.990> heel<00:03:26.260> forward<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:28.270> work

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
again scooting the heel forward to work

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.800 
again scooting the heel forward to work
that<00:03:28.750> promenade<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.940> very<00:03:31.390> difficult

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that promenade this is a very difficult

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.120 
that promenade this is a very difficult
exercise<00:03:32.670> working<00:03:33.670> balance<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.890> she

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
exercise working balance and if she

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.190 
exercise working balance and if she
doesn't<00:03:36.340> move<00:03:36.760> from<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> proper<00:03:37.510> place<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
doesn't move from the proper place the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.010 
doesn't move from the proper place the
disc<00:03:38.440> actually<00:03:38.709> won't<00:03:39.190> move<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.780> nice

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
disc actually won't move so it's a nice

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.890 
disc actually won't move so it's a nice
way<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.380> test<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.280> balance<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.030> test<00:03:43.540> if

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
way to test that balance and test if

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.740 
way to test that balance and test if
they<00:03:44.080> are<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.590> fact<00:03:44.620> working<00:03:45.220> from<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.550> right

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
they are in fact working from the right

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.410 
they are in fact working from the right
musculature<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.820> now<00:03:48.940> we're<00:03:49.090> going<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.270> work

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
musculature so now we're going to work

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.660 
musculature so now we're going to work
pirouettes<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> rotator<00:03:50.920> disk<00:03:51.250> which<00:03:51.640> is

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
pirouettes on the rotator disk which is

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.500 
pirouettes on the rotator disk which is
a<00:03:51.820> very<00:03:52.600> challenging<00:03:52.810> thing<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.920> do<00:03:54.510> when

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
a very challenging thing to do when

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.390 
a very challenging thing to do when
we're<00:03:55.780> working<00:03:55.810> pirouettes<00:03:56.770> just<00:03:57.130> on<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
we're working pirouettes just on the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.270 
we're working pirouettes just on the
regular<00:03:57.790> floor<00:03:58.239> there's<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.840> balance<00:03:59.800> element

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
regular floor there's a balance element

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.280 
regular floor there's a balance element
that<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.520> dancer<00:04:00.880> has<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.090> achieve<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:02.170> is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
that the dancer has to achieve that is

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.620 
that the dancer has to achieve that is
very<00:04:02.620> difficult<00:04:03.150> when<00:04:04.150> we're<00:04:04.450> actually

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
very difficult when we're actually

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.020 
very difficult when we're actually
working<00:04:04.959> on<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> rotator<00:04:05.830> discs<00:04:06.370> we're<00:04:06.820> not

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
working on the rotator discs we're not

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.670 
working on the rotator discs we're not
going<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.300> go<00:04:07.390> up<00:04:07.480> into<00:04:07.630> releve<00:04:08.170> she's<00:04:08.560> gonna

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
going to go up into releve she's gonna

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.280

feeling free to do multiple pirouettes

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.460 
feeling free to do multiple pirouettes

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
but you're really working the balance

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.860 
but you're really working the balance
and<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.960> control<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:05.040> standing<00:06:05.880> up<00:06:06.060> onto

your<00:06:07.050> balance<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.880> spotting<00:06:09.510> is<00:06:09.750> more<00:06:10.110> of<00:06:10.230> a

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
your balance the spotting is more of a

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.070 
your balance the spotting is more of a
gentle<00:06:11.010> spotting<00:06:11.820> it's<00:06:12.090> not<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.300> quick<00:06:12.780> heavy

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
gentle spotting it's not a quick heavy

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.620 
gentle spotting it's not a quick heavy
spotting<00:06:13.800> or<00:06:14.040> you'll<00:06:14.550> find<00:06:14.880> that<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.300> discs

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
spotting or you'll find that the discs

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.650 
spotting or you'll find that the discs
will<00:06:15.810> spin<00:06:16.080> around<00:06:16.110> too<00:06:17.100> much<00:06:17.630> so<00:06:18.630> just

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
will spin around too much so just

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.650 
will spin around too much so just
working<00:06:19.380> going<00:06:19.890> inward<00:06:20.460> working<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.150> center

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
working going inward working the center

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:31.290 
working going inward working the center
and<00:06:21.930> then<00:06:22.920> landing<00:06:23.430> in<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.700> fourth

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.050 

so<00:06:31.870> working<00:06:32.140> turns<00:06:32.620> on<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:33.010> rotator<00:06:33.400> discs<00:06:33.910> is

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
so working turns on the rotator discs is

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.840 
so working turns on the rotator discs is
very<00:06:34.480> very<00:06:35.050> challenging<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:36.040> KY<00:06:36.340> made<00:06:36.640> that

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
very very challenging and KY made that

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.300 
very very challenging and KY made that
look<00:06:37.000> very<00:06:37.330> easy<00:06:37.420> but<00:06:38.410> it's<00:06:38.560> a<00:06:38.710> very<00:06:39.010> difficult

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
look very easy but it's a very difficult

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.600 
look very easy but it's a very difficult
exercise<00:06:39.880> and<00:06:40.750> your<00:06:41.500> when<00:06:42.010> you<00:06:42.160> work<00:06:42.370> them

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
exercise and your when you work them

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.820 
exercise and your when you work them
you're<00:06:42.850> going<00:06:43.000> to<00:06:43.120> see<00:06:43.390> any<00:06:43.660> deviations<00:06:44.500> that

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
you're going to see any deviations that

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.100 
you're going to see any deviations that
the<00:06:44.950> dancer<00:06:45.280> might<00:06:45.490> have<00:06:45.900> while<00:06:46.900> they're

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
the dancer might have while they're

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.080 
the dancer might have while they're
turning<00:06:47.410> that<00:06:47.830> they<00:06:47.980> can<00:06:48.280> hide<00:06:48.610> if<00:06:48.910> they're

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
turning that they can hide if they're

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.600 
turning that they can hide if they're
not<00:06:49.240> on<00:06:49.450> the<00:06:49.600> rotator<00:06:49.990> disks<00:06:50.410> so<00:06:50.890> it<00:06:51.070> reveals

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
not on the rotator disks so it reveals

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.520 
not on the rotator disks so it reveals
any<00:06:52.000> imbalance<00:06:52.630> which<00:06:52.840> is<00:06:52.990> nice<00:06:53.170> because<00:06:53.290> then

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
any imbalance which is nice because then

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.100 
any imbalance which is nice because then
you<00:06:53.620> can<00:06:53.830> actually<00:06:54.040> work<00:06:54.430> on<00:06:54.610> that<00:06:54.850> so<00:06:55.780> thanks

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
you can actually work on that so thanks

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.930 
you can actually work on that so thanks
