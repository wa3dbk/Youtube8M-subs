then you know the thing we're still
battling<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> thought<00:00:36.030> our

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
battling which I one thing I thought our

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560 
battling which I one thing I thought our
practice<00:00:37.410> before<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.969> pretty<00:00:39.239> good

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
practice before this was pretty good

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
practice before this was pretty good
because<00:00:40.440> i<00:00:40.890> thought<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> execution<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
because i thought the execution was a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.340 
because i thought the execution was a
little<00:00:42.360> better<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.170> higher

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
little better there's a little higher

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
little better there's a little higher
level<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> consistency<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.079> were<00:00:46.140> back

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
level of consistency here we were back

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.270 
level of consistency here we were back
to<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> series<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> explosives<00:00:48.950> but<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to a series of explosives but with that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
to a series of explosives but with that
said<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.670> mean<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.239> better<00:00:51.480> than<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
said I mean it's better than if you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
said I mean it's better than if you
would<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.559> asked<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.010> before<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.489> neither

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
would have asked me before I neither

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.510 
would have asked me before I neither
started<00:00:54.300> how<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.840> thought<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

would you know we're better than I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
would you know we're better than I
thought<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.210> I'm

you always hope for a little better
you're<00:01:28.080> talking<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.500> receiving

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you're talking about your receiving

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.660 
you're talking about your receiving
corps<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> maybe<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.950> all<00:01:31.950> good<00:01:32.310> speed

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
corps and maybe just all good speed

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.950 
corps and maybe just all good speed
mixed<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.890> ability<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> make<00:01:35.960> explosive

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
mixed in the ability to make explosive

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.330 
mixed in the ability to make explosive
plays<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:39.110> think<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.590> consistent<00:01:41.250> as

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
plays I think and not as consistent as

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.630 
plays I think and not as consistent as
we<00:01:41.520> need<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.560> not<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.680> physical<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.460> need

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we need to be not as physical as we need

short guys but I haven't had anybody
that<00:02:02.810> once<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.960> start<00:02:04.259> playing<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:04.799> that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
that once they start playing well that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.059 
that once they start playing well that
didn't<00:02:05.250> realize<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:07.500> block<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
didn't realize that if I don't block I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.590 
didn't realize that if I don't block I
don't<00:02:08.280> play<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
don't play and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.230 
don't play and
there's<00:02:10.320> some<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.490> think<00:02:11.790> right<00:02:11.970> now<00:02:12.210> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
there's some that I think right now that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.850 
there's some that I think right now that
think<00:02:12.600> they<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:12.930> play<00:02:13.140> whether<00:02:13.380> they<00:02:13.560> block

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
think they make play whether they block

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940 
think they make play whether they block
or<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.490> that's<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.000> case<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
or not and that's not the case with the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.460 
or not and that's not the case with the
defense<00:02:17.280> making<00:02:17.490> changes<00:02:18.080> does<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> play

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
defense making changes does that play

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
defense making changes does that play
into<00:02:19.500> maybe<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> rules<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.580> you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
into maybe some of the rules that you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
into maybe some of the rules that you
guys<00:02:20.880> go<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.270> often<00:02:21.570> simply<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.960> seen

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
guys go in and often simply just seen

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.420 
guys go in and often simply just seen
different<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.740> other<00:02:22.860> side<00:02:23.040> well

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
different things on the other side well

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.340 
different things on the other side well
I<00:02:23.460> think<00:02:23.580> both<00:02:23.910> sides<00:02:24.210> went<00:02:24.450> into<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> laws<00:02:25.050> i

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
I think both sides went into the laws i

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.380 
I think both sides went into the laws i
say<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.860> i<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.850> i<00:02:26.880> like

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
say and i think you know what i like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
say and i think you know what i like
about<00:02:27.450> our<00:02:27.840> defense<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.770> our<00:02:29.280> defense<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.910> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
about our defense is our defense is a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.180 
about our defense is our defense is a
group<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.480> know<00:02:30.600> they<00:02:30.750> try<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.620> win<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
group you know they try to win it on the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.070 
group you know they try to win it on the
defensive<00:02:32.700> side<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> ball<00:02:33.180> too<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.840> mean

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
defensive side of the ball too I mean

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.040 
defensive side of the ball too I mean
it's<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.590> an<00:02:34.710> absorbed<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.900> know

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
it's not just an absorbed and you know

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.810 
it's not just an absorbed and you know
deliberately<00:02:37.590> they<00:02:37.890> have<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> lot<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.280> stuff<00:02:38.640> in

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
deliberately they have a lot of stuff in

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.510 
deliberately they have a lot of stuff in
and<00:02:39.060> deliberately<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:41.430> don't

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and deliberately you know we don't

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.750 
and deliberately you know we don't
script<00:02:41.940> out<00:02:42.150> when<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.510> blitz<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:44.430> wanted

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
script out when we blitz we wanted

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.910 
script out when we blitz we wanted
firing<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.690> random<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.350> like<00:02:46.710> they

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
firing it so it's random like like they

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.010 
firing it so it's random like like they
need<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.550> game<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.840> we

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
need to do in the game and and and we

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.960 
need to do in the game and and and we
want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> face<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.520> know<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> mean

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
want to face it that way you know I mean

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
want to face it that way you know I mean
we're<00:02:51.120> better<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:52.320> learn<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.620> from<00:02:52.710> these<00:02:52.950> guys

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
we're better to learn it from these guys

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860 
we're better to learn it from these guys
and<00:02:53.220> out<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> streets<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.360> thought<00:02:54.600> our<00:02:54.750> own

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and out in the streets I thought our own

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.310 
and out in the streets I thought our own
line<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:57.030> drills<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.870> thought<00:02:58.110> were<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
line in in drills I thought were a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.470 
line in in drills I thought were a
little<00:02:58.560> ragged<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.190> thought<00:02:59.520> you'd<00:02:59.820> team<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
little ragged I thought you'd team I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.760 
little ragged I thought you'd team I
thought<00:03:01.230> they<00:03:01.410> played<00:03:01.440> pretty<00:03:01.950> well<00:03:02.660> and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
thought they played pretty well and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.440 
thought they played pretty well and
right<00:03:04.770> now<00:03:04.980> we're<00:03:05.190> doing<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.820> know<00:03:05.970> right<00:03:06.240> now

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
right now we're doing you know right now

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.900 
right now we're doing you know right now
it's<00:03:07.170> kind<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.650> cross<00:03:07.890> between<00:03:07.950> overly

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
it's kind of a cross between overly

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.790 
it's kind of a cross between overly
conscientious<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.960> turning<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.410> loose<00:03:10.620> you

conscientious and turning it loose you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.200 
conscientious and turning it loose you
got<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.010> be<00:03:11.070> conscientious<00:03:11.640> if<00:03:11.970> you're<00:03:12.120> going

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
got to be conscientious if you're going

think I think right now trying to absorb
a<00:04:04.830> lot<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.580> think<00:04:06.390> trying<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.750> absorb<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.170> lot<00:04:07.320> of

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
a lot I think trying to absorb a lot of

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.510 
a lot I think trying to absorb a lot of
stuff<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.070> think

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.290 

yeah<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:11.730> know<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.930> it's<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:14.300> has

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
yeah you know it's it's I think has

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.009 
yeah you know it's it's I think has
picked<00:04:15.600> up<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.900> lot<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:17.400> think<00:04:17.730> he<00:04:17.910> reacts<00:04:18.360> I

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
picked up a lot and I think he reacts I

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.750 
picked up a lot and I think he reacts I
think<00:04:19.440> he<00:04:19.560> reacts<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> lot<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.549> things

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
think he reacts to a lot of things

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.430 
think he reacts to a lot of things
quickly<00:04:22.850> inspected<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.900> with<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.170> said

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
quickly inspected but with that said

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.670 
quickly inspected but with that said
without<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.130> stuff<00:04:26.430> he's<00:04:26.610> got<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:27.680> think

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
without all the stuff he's got I think

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.920 
without all the stuff he's got I think
sometimes<00:04:30.470> sometimes<00:04:31.470> he<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:33.540> know<00:04:33.630> over

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
sometimes sometimes he you know over

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.080 
sometimes sometimes he you know over
thinks<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.440> are<00:04:34.560> slow<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.890> react<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.550> part

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
thinks that are slow to react and part

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.910 
thinks that are slow to react and part
of<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.300> we<00:04:36.390> just<00:04:36.720> got<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.110> have<00:04:37.200> reps<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.800> know

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
of it we just got to have reps you know

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.380 
of it we just got to have reps you know
I<00:04:37.950> mean<00:04:38.250> it's<00:04:38.370> one<00:04:38.490> thing<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.730> see<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.150> film

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
I mean it's one thing to see it on film

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.630 
I mean it's one thing to see it on film
recognize<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.260> know<00:04:40.410> what<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:40.980> then

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
recognize that know what to do and then

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.300 
recognize that know what to do and then
react<00:04:41.970> sharply<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.260> split<00:04:43.530> second<00:04:44.100> thing

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
react sharply in that split second thing

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.970 
react sharply in that split second thing
and<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.330> other<00:04:45.480> thing<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.840> think<00:04:45.900> is<00:04:46.320> is

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
and the other thing I think is is

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.250 
and the other thing I think is is
getting<00:04:47.700> used<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.300> receivers<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.170> know

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
getting used to the receivers you know

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.050 
getting used to the receivers you know
get<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> lot<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.710> balls<00:04:50.010> okay<00:04:50.370> this<00:04:50.550> guy<00:04:50.700> does<00:04:50.910> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
get a lot of balls okay this guy does it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.580 
get a lot of balls okay this guy does it
this<00:04:51.210> way<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.570> guy<00:04:51.720> does<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.230> way<00:04:52.380> I

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
this way that guy does it that way I

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.130 
this way that guy does it that way I
think<00:04:53.250> very<00:04:53.520> impressive<00:04:54.180> based<00:04:54.450> on<00:04:54.720> how<00:04:54.900> many

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
think very impressive based on how many

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.380 
think very impressive based on how many
reps<00:04:55.440> ease<00:04:55.710> he's<00:04:56.370> had<00:04:56.640> because<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.120> know<00:04:57.240> if

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
reps ease he's had because you know if

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.640 
reps ease he's had because you know if
you<00:04:57.510> think<00:04:57.720> about<00:04:57.840> he<00:04:58.110> didn't<00:04:58.350> get<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.470> lot<00:04:58.620> of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
you think about he didn't get a lot of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.320 
you think about he didn't get a lot of
reps<00:04:58.920> last<00:04:59.190> season<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:01.440> know<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:02.030> but<00:05:03.030> i<00:05:03.060> think

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
reps last season you know in but i think

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.700 
reps last season you know in but i think
i<00:05:03.390> think<00:05:03.660> doing<00:05:03.780> really<00:05:04.020> well<00:05:04.230> i<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:04.440> its

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
i think doing really well i think its

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.160 
i think doing really well i think its
leadership<00:05:04.980> quality<00:05:05.520> is<00:05:05.580> really<00:05:05.610> good

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
leadership quality is really good

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.360 
leadership quality is really good
wouldn't<00:05:07.170> you<00:05:07.230> tell<00:05:07.470> about<00:05:07.590> your<00:05:07.830> receivers

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
wouldn't you tell about your receivers

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.920 
wouldn't you tell about your receivers
in<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.580> scrimmage<00:05:08.850> setting<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.480> you<00:05:09.630> wouldn't

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
in a scrimmage setting that you wouldn't

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.170 
in a scrimmage setting that you wouldn't
get<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.410> from<00:05:10.590> normal<00:05:11.520> team<00:05:11.670> session<00:05:12.090> in

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
get just from normal team session in

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.100 
get just from normal team session in
practice<00:05:12.570> ah<00:05:13.790> well<00:05:14.790> i<00:05:14.850> think<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.390> goes<00:05:16.080> a

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
practice ah well i think it goes a

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.659 
practice ah well i think it goes a
little<00:05:16.380> faster<00:05:16.650> i<00:05:16.919> think<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.220> plays<00:05:17.460> are

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
little faster i think the plays are

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.810 
little faster i think the plays are
faster<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.330> think<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.690> things<00:05:19.730> happen<00:05:20.730> a

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
faster and I think the things happen a

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.659 
faster and I think the things happen a
little<00:05:20.940> faster<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:22.410> I'll<00:05:22.620> tell<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.190> I

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
little faster and I'll tell you and I

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.450 
little faster and I'll tell you and I
saw<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.880> little<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.570> both<00:05:24.750> sides<00:05:25.460> one

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
saw a little of this on both sides one

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.460 
saw a little of this on both sides one
thing<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.760> happens<00:05:27.419> is<00:05:27.660> sometimes<00:05:28.080> they

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
thing that happens is sometimes they

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.409 
thing that happens is sometimes they
make<00:05:28.680> more<00:05:28.890> out<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.310> than<00:05:29.340> what<00:05:29.669> it<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.060> and

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
make more out of it than what it is and

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.260 
make more out of it than what it is and
then<00:05:31.200> evolved<00:05:31.950> into<00:05:32.250> streetball<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:33.120> know

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
then evolved into streetball you know

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.640 
then evolved into streetball you know
rather<00:05:33.510> than<00:05:33.630> just<00:05:33.870> your<00:05:34.080> assignment<00:05:34.590> and

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
rather than just your assignment and

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.850 
rather than just your assignment and
technique<00:05:35.130> then<00:05:35.880> it's<00:05:36.120> just<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:37.050> know<00:05:37.230> kind

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
technique then it's just you know kind

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.950 
technique then it's just you know kind
of<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.040> running<00:05:38.669> get<00:05:38.910> open<00:05:39.300> type<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.750> deal<00:05:39.930> you

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
of a running get open type of deal you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.700 
of a running get open type of deal you
know<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.620> so<00:05:41.510> like<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.720> thought<00:05:42.930> we<00:05:43.140> had<00:05:43.169> a<00:05:43.320> lot

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
know and so like I thought we had a lot

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.560 
know and so like I thought we had a lot
more<00:05:43.860> precision<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.580> scale<00:05:44.940> than<00:05:45.180> came<00:05:45.390> down

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
more precision and scale than came down

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.800 
more precision and scale than came down
here<00:05:46.280> you<00:05:47.280> know<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.700> there's<00:05:48.060> all<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.270> stuff

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
here you know and there's all that stuff

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.570 
here you know and there's all that stuff
and<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.200> think<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.890> get<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.280> out<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.460> your

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
and so I think you get that out of your

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.850 
and so I think you get that out of your
system<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:51.150> little<00:05:51.390> bit<00:05:51.570> didn't<00:05:52.410> see<00:05:52.530> Connor<00:05:52.740> is

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
system a little bit didn't see Connor is

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.520 
system a little bit didn't see Connor is
the<00:05:52.980> status<00:05:53.580> changed<00:05:53.610> at<00:05:54.000> all<00:05:54.169> he's<00:05:55.169> doing

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
great he's a got a family deal he's

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.710 
great he's a got a family deal he's

pulling<00:06:59.940> the<00:07:00.180> trigger<00:07:00.390> when<00:07:00.690> you<00:07:00.780> consider

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.170 
pulling the trigger when you consider

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.310 
pulling the trigger when you consider
that<00:07:02.390> everybody's<00:07:03.390> installing<00:07:04.020> everything

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
for the first time but we're not as

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.930 
for the first time but we're not as
consistent<00:07:07.980> at<00:07:08.070> pulling<00:07:08.250> the<00:07:08.430> trigger<00:07:08.610> as<00:07:08.790> we

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
consistent at pulling the trigger as we

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.940 
consistent at pulling the trigger as we

their hips like that okay but then by

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.420 
their hips like that okay but then by
the<00:07:14.760> same<00:07:15.120> token<00:07:15.560> at<00:07:16.560> some<00:07:16.830> point<00:07:17.100> when<00:07:17.310> you

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
the same token at some point when you

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.880 
the same token at some point when you
line<00:07:17.970> up<00:07:18.000> and<00:07:18.300> snap<00:07:18.540> the<00:07:18.720> ball<00:07:18.900> you<00:07:19.680> know<00:07:19.800> you

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890 
line up and snap the ball you know you

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.800 
line up and snap the ball you know you
got<00:07:20.190> to<00:07:20.310> pull<00:07:20.490> the<00:07:20.640> pin<00:07:20.910> coach<00:07:21.240> Russell<00:07:21.600> always

got to pull the pin coach Russell always

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.590 
got to pull the pin coach Russell always
says<00:07:21.990> pull<00:07:22.230> the<00:07:22.350> pin<00:07:22.620> hey<00:07:22.970> so<00:07:24.290> but<00:07:26.270> so<00:07:27.270> we<00:07:27.420> got

says pull the pin hey so but so we got

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.870 
says pull the pin hey so but so we got
but<00:07:27.870> really<00:07:28.230> conscientious<00:07:28.860> and<00:07:29.220> focus<00:07:29.700> and

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
but really conscientious and focus and

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.490 
but really conscientious and focus and
trying<00:07:30.120> to<00:07:30.210> work<00:07:30.390> hard<00:07:30.630> and<00:07:30.900> want<00:07:31.050> to<00:07:31.110> do<00:07:31.290> well

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
trying to work hard and want to do well

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.570 
trying to work hard and want to do well
and<00:07:31.680> I<00:07:31.800> think<00:07:31.830> that<00:07:33.800> you<00:07:34.800> know<00:07:34.890> with<00:07:35.070> that<00:07:35.250> said

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
and I think that you know with that said

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.220 
and I think that you know with that said
that<00:07:35.820> I<00:07:35.850> mean<00:07:35.970> there's<00:07:36.150> times<00:07:36.720> you<00:07:36.840> just<00:07:37.020> turn

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
that I mean there's times you just turn

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.840 
that I mean there's times you just turn
it<00:07:37.350> loose<00:07:37.530> too<00:07:37.890> and<00:07:38.160> I<00:07:38.280> think<00:07:38.610> we're<00:07:38.730> getting

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:38.850 
it loose too and I think we're getting

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.690 
it loose too and I think we're getting
closer<00:07:39.210> and<00:07:39.390> closer
