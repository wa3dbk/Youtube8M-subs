00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
different now this is the older version

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.790 
different now this is the older version
I<00:04:12.630> will<00:04:12.780> say<00:04:13.020> because<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.530> see<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
I will say because you can see the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.560 
I will say because you can see the
exposed<00:04:14.580> tang<00:04:15.180> here<00:04:15.630> but<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.440> see<00:04:16.709> that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
exposed tang here but you see that

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:26.630 
exposed tang here but you see that
toilet<00:04:18.570> oil<00:04:19.230> there<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.160> gives<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.430> little

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
toilet oil there so it gives a little

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.310 
toilet oil there so it gives a little
bit<00:04:26.730> more<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.360> can<00:04:27.510> choke<00:04:27.690> up<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.170> know

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320
