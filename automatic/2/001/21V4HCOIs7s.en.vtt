thicker it's 130 x 65 x 11.8 and in

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340 
thicker it's 130 x 65 x 11.8 and in
terms<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.009> weight<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.640> heavier<00:02:06.350> 173

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
terms of weight it's a lot heavier 173

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
terms of weight it's a lot heavier 173
grams<00:02:07.590> compared<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.069> 140<00:02:08.640> grams<00:02:08.819> both<00:02:09.690> devices

do<00:02:10.259> feel<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.920> solid<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.550> they<00:02:11.819> both

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
do feel really solid and they both

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.660 
do feel really solid and they both
have<00:02:12.249> very<00:02:12.640> good<00:02:12.909> build<00:02:13.450> quality<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:15.519> there

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
have very good build quality so there

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.849 
have very good build quality so there
you<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.909> that's<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.709> physical

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
you have it that's all the physical

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.369 
you have it that's all the physical
dimensions<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.609> phone<00:02:18.790> take<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.299> out<00:02:19.389> so

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
dimensions of the phone take it out so

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.449 
dimensions of the phone take it out so
let's<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.680> back<00:02:20.799> into<00:02:20.950> some<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.370> their

let's get back into some of their

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.160 
let's get back into some of their
features<00:02:21.790> will<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.239> into<00:02:22.389> this<00:02:22.510> display

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to be a bigger display but it still is

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.280 
to be a bigger display but it still is

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.330 
into some of these cameras these are I
think<00:03:56.500> if<00:03:56.979> not<00:03:57.729> the<00:03:57.939> two<00:03:58.540> best<00:03:59.159> cameras<00:04:00.159> on<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
think if not the two best cameras on the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.390 
think if not the two best cameras on the
market<00:04:00.370> right<00:04:00.699> now<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.810> terms<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.620> terms<00:04:03.280> of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
market right now in terms of terms of

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.280 
market right now in terms of terms of
cell<00:04:03.549> phones<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.329> they're<00:04:04.449> both<00:04:04.599> using<00:04:04.810> i<00:04:05.109> 8

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
cell phones so they're both using i 8

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.479 
cell phones so they're both using i 8
megapixel<00:04:05.829> sensors<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:08.099> they<00:04:09.099> both<00:04:09.250> have

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
megapixel sensors and they both have

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.179 
megapixel sensors and they both have
really<00:04:10.180> good<00:04:10.449> software<00:04:11.139> put<00:04:11.739> in<00:04:11.829> with<00:04:11.979> them<00:04:12.069> as

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
really good software put in with them as

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.860 
really good software put in with them as
well<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.609> let's<00:04:13.209> just<00:04:13.359> take<00:04:13.449> a<00:04:13.509> picture<00:04:13.719> of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
in the camera and we'll get that and we

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.330 
in the camera and we'll get that and we
can<00:04:35.560> look<00:04:35.889> at<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.039> side<00:04:36.250> by<00:04:36.280> side<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.070> can

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
can look at it side by side so you can

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.719 
can look at it side by side so you can
see<00:04:39.580> almost<00:04:39.940> pretty<00:04:40.330> much<00:04:41.100> similar<00:04:42.100> quality

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
see almost pretty much similar quality

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.290 
see almost pretty much similar quality
it's<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:45.520> maze<00:04:45.789> does<00:04:46.030> seem<00:04:46.210> a

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
it's just that the the maze does seem a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.730 
it's just that the the maze does seem a
little<00:04:46.539> bit<00:04:46.690> brighter<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.080> colors<00:04:47.350> do<00:04:47.530> tend

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
little bit brighter the colors do tend

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.710 
little bit brighter the colors do tend
to<00:04:47.800> pop<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.009> little<00:04:48.160> more<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.300> can<00:04:49.449> check

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
to pop a little more so you can check

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.090 
to pop a little more so you can check
out<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.050> review<00:04:50.350> on<00:04:50.410> into<00:04:50.650> mobile<00:04:50.919> they<00:04:51.009> have

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
out the review on into mobile they have

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.830 
out the review on into mobile they have
a<00:04:51.130> whole<00:04:51.340> breakdown<00:04:51.639> of<00:04:51.820> both<00:04:52.479> camera

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
a whole breakdown of both camera

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.700 
a whole breakdown of both camera
features<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.720> think<00:04:56.259> they're<00:04:56.470> both<00:04:56.560> great

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
features so I think they're both great

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.580 
features so I think they're both great
cameras<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.970> Amaze<00:04:58.210> does<00:04:58.599> is<00:04:58.840> one<00:04:59.500> of

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
cameras I think the Amaze does is one of

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.230 
cameras I think the Amaze does is one of
the<00:04:59.650> best<00:04:59.830> camera<00:05:00.430> cameras<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.210> market

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
the best camera cameras on the market

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.330 
the best camera cameras on the market
right<00:05:01.539> now<00:05:01.660> that's<00:05:02.320> personal<00:05:02.740> preference<00:05:03.130> if

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
right now that's personal preference if

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.670 
right now that's personal preference if
you<00:05:03.849> feel<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.720> iphones<00:05:05.020> better<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.410> totally

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
you feel the iphones better it's totally

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.240 
you feel the iphones better it's totally
up<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.900> let's<00:05:08.020> get<00:05:08.110> into<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.349> processing
