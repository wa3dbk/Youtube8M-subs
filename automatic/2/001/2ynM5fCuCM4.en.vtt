00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.870
 we are in a boyfriend of gta 5 online this 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 once is no trick of any vessel 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.169
 nor any gay if none of that today I 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.219
 I bring rather an informative video in 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.409
 the pole I want to tell some things 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.539
 quite interesting about the new tlc 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.830
 or the new online gta 5 patch because 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.380
 good as you know today 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 we're in patch 1.08 and it's supposed 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.679
 that good soon they will take the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.259
 new part that is going to be a point is going to 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.269
 be the 1.09 forgiveness which will include 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.730
 a new dlc as you already know as 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.990
 he spends his time in gta 5 because we 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.090
 they are getting different milk that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 they are totally free so good 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.240
 Well that I come to tell you some 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 curiosities some rumors or some 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.260
 leaks as you want to call it about 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.060
 the new dlc and I come to tell you between 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.830
 quotes what will this dlc contain 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.540
 not so good to say I'll tell you 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.250
 four little things are worth the egg 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.080
 four rumors about the new dlc and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 tell you that the last thing I'm going to 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.250
 count of these good is almost 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 confirmed because it seems good that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 it's going to be like that there's a lot of information 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.470
 that affirms it and the first three things 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.210
 Well, they are a little bit when I read them 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.380
 out there is not that it is very confirmed 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.450
 but they also make a bit of sense 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.739
 so well then let's go with the first 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.500
 little thing that I will tell you the first 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.240
 rumor about the new patch 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.820
 1.09 you already know and well it seems to be 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.829
 that on the map of the saints I suppose 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.729
 you will know there is a kind of building 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.780
 which is a casino if you go to the casino 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.909
 in gta 5 online 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.950
 he does not let you in what happens so 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.930
 there seems to be a rumor that says what 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.179
 has read out there that the casino in the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 patch 1.09 will open for brines and 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.570
 it will effectively open for all 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.820
 the players which we can enter 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.920
 to the casino and betting we are big and 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.179
 there are many amounts of money be 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.830
 abominable amounts that obviously 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.319
 that's what a casino does for 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.119
 I say honestly I think this 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.670
 I would be pretty cool because really 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 if you think you can in GTA 5 online 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
 no race no charge only 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 no where to bet anything 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.190
 against another person who is very much 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
 money is not there for are nervous of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.490
 they are really tense saying ostias 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 that if I lose I can lose a lot of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.159
 money then this from the casino the time 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 that would be pretty cool not me 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.880
 I honestly think about what you think 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.470
 you for the comments later the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.299
 next I feel the rumor or curiosity 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.170
 is that if you put on the mobile in gt5 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.810
 online line and he 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 nn and if we put it on the mobile in the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.470
 search engine on the internet as you already know 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.209
 mobile with internet if we put it in the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.010
 seeker the word read and we get a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.190
 kind of website 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.160
 which it is a page that is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
 can buy mansions in gta 5 what 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.000
 it happens because that page appears 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.319
 fully occupied appears closed can 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.510
 that is not available at that time 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.180
 therefore it seems that in the part 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.930
 1.0 sorry first part is my mother 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.940
 boy in the patch 1.09 it seems that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.040
 well, they will activate it, it is supposed 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.480
 ok it's a rumor like this and how I've 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.620
 said from the beginning of the video 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.299
 supposed to activate it and we can 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.040
 buy different mansions there 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.170
 distributed by the game that will be houses 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.360
 super expensive and they will have garage and 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.160
 of all progress that will be mansions that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 one thing that also quite liked 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.700
 how are we going with the following the next 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.019
 rumor which is that as you know there 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.980
 a kind of area of the map of the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.230
 saints obviously 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 in which there is like a kind of mini 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.610
 say it a mini circuit for horses 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.110
 because I do not know if brigid or not but what 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.970
 said there is a kind of circuit to 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.489
 horses with the circuit is said to follow 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.560
 to track to run the horses not in 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.910
 which I can out there is supposed to be 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 they would have to hold careers 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.209
 horses then it seems that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.640
 other rumors that are going to include in this 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.079
 new dlc the horses and he will have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.459
 horse racing in that kind of 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.049
 enclosure in which they are also going to 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.909
 power to then you will be able to bet 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.739
 money not that they include the 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.180
 horses in the game or in all the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.430
 game forever on gt5 online that 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.810
 we can not take them, but we can not 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 see it and through the forest I really 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.069
 It seems somewhat sees me a little 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.680
 nonsense not that it's really not going to be 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.239
 well because I know that if not the the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.190
 horse is a very common animal and not 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.230
 I suppose if I wanted to put it in gta 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.970
 5 they will not put it in a dlc what would 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.230
 got it from the beginning but that's 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.060
 the horse races that are the 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.430
 horses go out in the race really 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.230
 it seems a bit like a hundred 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.730
 somewhat true the truth me that's what 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.739
 I would believe a little more so nothing like 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.879
 I always say that in this type of video 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.319
 I look very much in the comments 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.260
 because I like to see your opinion 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.040
 see your pinion 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 whatever is 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.310
 tell us some derivation I know 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.810
 say they look at me and then in this of the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.579
 mansions is right because also 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.019
 apart I have thought that and it puts me I know if 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.850
 gives some reason which has logical or 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.870
 and the truth is not that I know better me 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.979
 It seems interesting 2 look at 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.470
 comments on this type of videos 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.750
 reasons and finally tell you is this 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.460
 news which sorry news 2 the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 curiosity of the rumor rumor that rather 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.610
 it's filtration because it's pretty 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.320
 confirmed which has discovered a 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 American I think it was and well then 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.500
 this kid what he has done has been 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.199
 decipher a kind of secret code 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.820
 of gta 5 of rockstar and well it seems 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.130
 be that this code what it included was 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.600
 that in the next tlc there was going to be a 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.210
 kind of emission which I was going to try 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.590
 to rob a bank in a cooperative 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.120
 that this really was what everyone 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.740
 they wanted world the same mission of power 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.430
 attack a cooperative bank and be able to 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.710
 take out a lot of money 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.590
 Well, I'll tell you figures, it seems that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.690
 in the mission of this in the mission of 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.150
 dock the bank because they will give us 80 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.830
 a thousand dollars I think they were worth 80 thousand 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.240
 dollars will have good page the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.350
 pages of this mission in the description 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.940
 It's worth it if you want to look more 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.199
 vital information there are all the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.580
 information and also come the 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.449
 even conversations that you will see in 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.920
 the broadcast something that did not seem 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.330
 quite surprising what was thrown 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.590
 I could even decipher them with 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.050
 all the conversations that are going to have 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.720
 in this mission and I believe that they are 80 thousand 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.670
 dollars what they will give us to do 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.170
 this emission is not 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.540
 this amount will obviously be distributed 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.890
 among all those who participate in 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.390
 the mission not so watching also 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.950
 tell you that the description be seen to have 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.810
 a second link which brings you to a 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.430
 kind of map of the saints in gta 5 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.750
 in which if you look up 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.640
 just above the map of a 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.010
 kind of blue mark in which you 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.380
 beings will be where the mission takes place 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.610
 of the bank robbery is worth a boys 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.140
 because this has been all this has been 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.730
 all the rumors that have come out of for 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.220
 after the next dlc of the following 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.600
 patch 1.09 so nothing can get me 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.160
 for the comments what do you think of everything 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.050
 this the truth is that there are some things 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.640
 that are a bit crazy but then 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.810
 can not happen I honestly some 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.340
 things that I believe it like this last 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.410
 how good the latter is almost almost 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.730
 confirmed is that rockstar says so 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.990
 in what is missing because you will see that there 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.490
 many tests not many proofs that 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.900
 this is going to be true not that it's going 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.760
 have a mission which we are going to have 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.320
 that dock a bank that nothing because I 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.580
 I've already looked forward to it coming out dlc 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.530
 and I suppose you also because the 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.910
 it really looks good so 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.320
 nothing then it is provisions all this video 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.700
 you know if you liked to like 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.590
 especially to subscribe and still not what 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.590
 you are and see you in the next goodbye 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.039
 with a year of more than one kilometer 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.039
 then there are no more accounts
