00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.009
 hello welcome to the second part of 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.689
 our special screws today 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.220
 I will show how you can adjust your 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.750
 bike to perfection and take out the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 maximum match to the elements of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.770
 cushioning when adjusting the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.940
 Driving train is important to adjust 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.249
 first the hardness of the suspension 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.359
 by air pressure both in the 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.460
 hairpin as well as in the 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.109
 cushion finally we will adjust the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.060
 cushioning so that the train of 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.679
 driving work perfectly what 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.720
 next that we should adjust are the 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.400
 suspension elements is to say the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.650
 fork and shock absorber to our 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 body weight we start with the hairpin 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.219
 when the fork like here has a 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 descent must first be deployed by 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.510
 complete something also very important is 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.309
 uninstall before adjusting the hardness 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 of the suspension all the elements 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.090
 like damping and cushioning 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.059
 by compression so that the fork 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.260
 can compress without limitations 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.140
 normally the cushioning by 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 compression is located up here this 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.320
 fork is a special case since 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.089
 here below there is another platform that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.739
 we will have to unscrew completely 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.870
 that is, in the opposite direction to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.730
 clock hands to adjust the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.769
 Negative travel suspension too 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.390
 called that axis it is imperative that 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.310
 let's have a rubber ring on the fork 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.110
 you may be already come included 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.890
 or else we can also fix it with a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.200
 flange 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.290
 the area where the tour takes place 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.760
 Negative suspension is down here 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 it fits when we sit down 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.020
 complete on the bicycle 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 is in charge of that when 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.760
 example we circulate on land 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.970
 wet or with ice the bicycle does not 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.430
 lose contact with the ground by 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.880
 general rule this area usually elevates the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.940
 travel of the suspension between a 20 and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.410
 30% to adjust the we can or ask 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240
 help someone to hold the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.369
 bike or look for a table or wall to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.290
 support it since it is important that we 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.660
 let's sit completely on the wheel is 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
 say with all our weight is also 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.670
 better to carry the backpack and clothes that are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.440
 will take the bike later we 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.110
 we put in the normal posture of 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.940
 driving centered on the wheel and 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 we press the suspension elements 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.100
 a couple of times 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.109
 we pull the rubber ring down 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 and we got off with care of the 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.069
 bicycle without the rubber ring 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.680
 move 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.280
 at the end we can measure the journey 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.220
 negative suspension 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.920
 in case of measuring 6 centimeters the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.709
 fork is too loose since in 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 20% of 150 forks 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.319
 millimeters would be 3 centimeters is 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.900
 say the hairpin is too much 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.000
 loose to inflate the fork and the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.420
 shock absorber we need a pump 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.770
 special one suspension pump 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.620
 let's start first with the fork here 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.360
 I will teach you a secret to wear 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 foxx hairpins easily to that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 hidden pressure screw up here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.080
 we just have to put it in position 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.730
 minus in the descent position the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.920
 screw is a bit high and you will be 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.990
 easier to unscrew what 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.090
 then we put ourselves back in 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.489
 driving position before starting 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.920
 the inflation if a pressure is not indicated 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.590
 recommended in the manual or printed on the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.750
 hairpin you will have to try 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.340
 say go back to inflate a little more and 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.410
 repeat the same thing that we just did 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.350
 to reach the correct level of that 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 axis between 20 and 25 percent of 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.000
 that axis and now we perform the test of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000
 new 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.920
 we pull the rubber ring down 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.920
 and we got off carefully 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:40.989
 now it measures 35 millimeters perfect one 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.239
 once adjusted the air pressure in the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.590
 fork let's go to the cushioning in 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.409
 the cushioning there are two possibilities 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.290
 adjustment on the one hand we have the level 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.299
 of traction better known as bounce and 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.489
 on the other the level of pressure or 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.319
 compression the level of traction of the 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.849
 fork regulates the speed of bounce 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 and the level of pressure regulates the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.450
 compression speed first 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.400
 we will adjust the level of traction for 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.049
 we must completely unscrew the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.060
 Traction level screw that 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.020
 It is normally red in color 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.700
 counter-clockwise 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.800
 not all forks have 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.450
 compression damping normally 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.670
 they only have the models a little more 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.080
 expensive or with more dock travel is 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.640
 important that the cushioning by 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.590
 compression is unscrewed by 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.870
 complete before we adjust the level 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.280
 of traction exactly as we have just 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.900
 do before adjusting the hardness of the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.910
 shock absorber 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.729
 to adjust the damping by 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.500
 compression that is the speed bounce 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.410
 we must pull the wheel brake 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.330
 front compress the wheel with all the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.259
 weight of our body with a movement 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.259
 fast and dynamic 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:52.100
 and then re- release the 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:55.750
 handlebar in this way we can see with 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.750
 how fast the fork bounces 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.340
 before adjusting the traction level in 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.260
 the shock absorber we also have to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.120
 unscrew the screw completely 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.080
 level of traction in the opposite direction to 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.080
 clockwise 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.400
 to check how fast it bounces 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.139
 to the back the easiest thing is that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.349
 go out to the street for a moment and 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.419
 you try looking for a curb sitting on 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.699
 the saddle and go down and climb the curb 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.620
 a couple of times to check with what 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.770
 often the back if it is 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.569
 compressed bounces again the ideal is 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.120
 that the back is compressed once 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.069
 then bounce and then the wheel will 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.499
 return to stabilize more or less once 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.659
 and half of us, we are going to do it here 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.849
 Another way to prove it is by giving it a 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.469
 brief impulse to the saddle and check with 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.839
 what speed or how often 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.379
 bounce the shock absorber when it is 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.379
 compressed 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.979
 the level of traction in the direction of 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.229
 clock hands should rise up to 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.179
 the driving train compress and 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.179
 rise again and finally stop 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.180
 just like we have done with the 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.770
 fork let's adjust now the 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.060
 shock absorber for this we must 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.550
 put us back in position 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.990
 initial sitting on the wheel and move 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.070
 a couple of times the elements of 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.750
 cushioning 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.730
 finally pull the extraction ring 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.710
 up and measure ls ag once we 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.450
 we got off the bicycle 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.580
 Negative travel suspension 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.220
 shock absorber should be between 25 and 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.230
 30 percent now the train of 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.880
 driving is adjusted have a good time 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.560
 with your bike in the next 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.360
 video I will show you all the settings 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.360
 needed of wheels and covers
