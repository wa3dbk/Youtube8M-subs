know some kind of cotton ball or

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.050 
know some kind of cotton ball or
something<00:04:17.169> but<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:18.099> was<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.400> good<00:04:18.519> experience

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
something but it was a good experience

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.379 
something but it was a good experience
and<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.479> ended<00:04:19.780> up<00:04:20.070> until<00:04:21.070> actually<00:04:21.759> twisting

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
and I ended up until actually twisting

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.439 
and I ended up until actually twisting
my<00:04:22.570> hair<00:04:22.599> so<00:04:23.560> basically<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.370> rollers<00:04:25.000> became

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
my hair so basically the rollers became

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.680 
my hair so basically the rollers became
just<00:04:25.919> stretched<00:04:26.919> way<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:28.570> know

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
like curly curly straight hair so it was

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.270 
like curly curly straight hair so it was
a<00:04:46.570> good<00:04:46.720> experience<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.560> probably<00:04:47.889> won't

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
a good experience but I probably won't

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.180 
a good experience but I probably won't
try<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.639> again<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.409> reminds<00:04:50.979> me
