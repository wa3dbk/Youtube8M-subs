00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.750
 Never have so many photos taken as now 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:24.220
 Everyone makes photos. We have all cameras on mobile phones. We have digital cameras 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.820
 they make you great photos for very little money 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.000
 But we do not really know how photography works, do we? 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 We do not know what its principles are 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:43.290
 and start with the most basic, which is to become a camera obscura 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.180
 and put in that dark chamber a photosensitive material, which is what those who did 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.180
 they invented photography 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 It seems to me that it can help you a lot 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.290
 At the time of later, you can consider your way of seeing things as a photographer. 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.750
 Going back to the origins, 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.660
 It is always very interesting, when it comes to perfecting anything you are involved with. 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.647
 We are used to using very expensive equipment, to spend a lot of money on cameras 

00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:06.647
 very expensive and in objectives. 

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:13.650
 You see what a camera like this costs, which is practically nothing. And what it costs 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 An objective. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.000
 It is to drink your beer, cut the sheet and make a hole. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.319
 It's a way, let's say to recycle things and to realize that with very few means, 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.999
 we can get interesting results. 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:44.009
 And personal because a photo that I make with a nut is not the same, 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.009
 that strange things come out, 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.310
 that the photo I make with a digital camera that is to shoot and see. 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.770
 When I take a picture with one of these cameras, 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.090
 I have an idea of ​​what is going to come out 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:05.299
 but I do not know it in reality, I do not see it until I reveal it, until I do not have it in 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.299
 the bucket 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.380
 And that is also very interesting. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 How chance intervenes 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 And many times nothing comes out. Sometimes they come out better and sometimes they get worse but it's like everything. 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.180
 Is that we are used to that I press the button and always leave. 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.670
 The course is usually a practical course. The theory things that we will learn 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 we will learn in a practical way. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.690
 The objective of the course is for you to learn how a camera works 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.940
 and that you know calculate the exposure. 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.060
 We will also make frames to check how photosensitive materials work, 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.210
 like the photo paper. 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.630
 And finally, we will build a camera and with that camera we will go out to take 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.940
 Photos. 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.180
 This as a hobby, at first requires a minimal outlay, then to buy paper 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.930
 photographic and buy chemicals to reveal it. 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.070
 Man, maybe with 50 euros you can start. 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 We can make cameras with practically anything, from a cardboard box, 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.330
 up a nut. 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.700
 There are people who make them with pine nuts, 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.630
 Peppers. 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.510
 You can make a camera with practically anything. 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.870
 But hey, there are even people who put this, the little hole in your digital SLR and you have 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.770
 a pinhole digital camera. 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.460
 One thing that's very surprising to the people who start with this is that you get things, 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.650
 things that are material. 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.340
 A digital photo, I see it on my computer, I print it if I want but in principle it is 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.080
 something immaterial, right? 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.150
 We are used to taking pictures and that the photos are on a memory card, 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.150
 q 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.210
 It's a pretty abstract thing. 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.740
 These pictures are concrete things, they are objects. They are papers. 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.240
 Every time we have less photos on paper. 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240
 We shoot thousands of photos but only those photos we see on paper very few. 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.310
 There are people who practically never pass them to paper. 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.833
 And here from the beginning we have a picture, 

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:15.842
 a material object.
