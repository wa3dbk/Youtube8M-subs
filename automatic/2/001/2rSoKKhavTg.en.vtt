 previous episode and I'm going to this one 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.690

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.590
 not with the selection 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.420
 yes the one the result is not too bad 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.619
 but yes you do not win again and then it is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.810
 trends for deadline day ' 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.210
 AIDS and no clicks happen because 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.190
 yes yes yes no yes and the next game 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.900
 is against rkc waalwijk and henk fräser stand 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.119
 I now yes yes sure 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.770
 sew tribe I'm going to show you that too 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.930
 it has been a good choice of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.310
 Mattie Soul and the Optimize Bar Brunetti 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 for space is so he can 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.850
 accelerate and to score always and rich 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.009
 nicolaas so there is what bothers me 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.210
 changed for Mike van Duinen in the 86th 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.350
 minute then i think you fuck you mike 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 dunes because I was comfortable in it and me 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 I scored so yes oh what the fuck 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.000
 is that guy the background do that 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.110
 both 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.269
 and also just this game there too 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.030
 still and I am blame to the objective 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.799
 a goal and achieved percentage to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.480
 saluting the big one does n't make sense to that 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.860
 objective achieved 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 new goals an average 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.870
 assessment of the six point zero score 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.640
 ankle 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.530
 shooting 10 percent from when you turn the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.910
 objective and get a narcissist the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 next western week against anything 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.870
 stable and the basis 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.640
 this moment your match is coming one 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.019
 boom a breeze and yes that shot hit 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
 of course not at all at all with it 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.080
 breeding with is way tidier its one 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.870
 car tire inside typed death and 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.000
 no one can go by flew by no okay 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.380
 so you handle your chances well but with 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.760
 a little patience you will forever 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.290
 Mattie you see through again 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.610
 dictum to the right winger and that 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.660
 of course he wants him back 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.040
 get one back 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.019
 looking for that bit of room for the shot 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.700
 goes in the other direction and cut down 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.200
 then you see a discount buy that curl 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.269
 hair for a second it could be 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 episode of mighty and his fifth 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.420
 goal again in this series and there 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.560
 be exchanged and in 76 smut to 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.329
 does not interest because this competition too 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.579
 We found out afterwards that we heard and 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.590
 that is nice than in the previous games we 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.120
 at home against ajax and ajax it never sinks 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.160
 easy to visit ado that they are you 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.180
 also this time but no cunt happens 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 at this time 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.680
 mix songs outside by ghosts for 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.690
 he says on mattie that was a joke 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.640
 so now someone who really scores me totally 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.620
 does not fascinate and so I actually 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.079
 yes also no as is step and making them now 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.180
 when weird are cheering oh well we 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.739
 winning response and being serious about it 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.569
 almost champions cake box from the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.700
 I play mess like this 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.319
 where i already have my 5 to 9 but yeah you know 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.700
 I used to be happy when I got one 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.130
 Rehearsal had not happened and I had 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.019
 one of your point 9 I secretly teach you 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.150
 actually never was so rehearsals 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.920
 i always happy with a 5 to 9 i was 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.730
 not really such a type that then a 5 min 9 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.319
 Pierre got an attention back 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.970
 next sit is against fc groningen and me 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.440
 basically about this how it van 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.579
 this way it cup it my husband out and 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.350
 then I canopy a hood again 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.660
 say search find and then sit 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.859
 everyone through the inside of the pole 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.639
 and then I go all the way with shout 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.660
 get completely crazy 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.660
 until the moment that 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.870
 get shot and he burst out guessing 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.180
 because this man in the audience shot him 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.970
 with them thin transverse hasses and lying there 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.680
 he then pathetic the cramps 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.780
 that really makes no sense, there is the best 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.340
 random cross from fc groningen flies 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.690
 again quite a shame because then 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.039
 is it a one but then the one in the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.330
 four ic shoe it is mattie dora makes 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.949
 room for his chocolate am on the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.419
 shoot and I cut ahead with the left in it 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.860
 2nd in the wheels now puts him 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.600
 do you know that decision is, then he wants that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.370
 know the finger direction 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.690
 henk fräser 8 young man yes a lot 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.669
 have to have faith in him sooner 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.139
 yes and then if it scores its services 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.789
 in his emotion 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.770
 this makes this gesture to me what I think 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.240
 you have to then they can venture across him 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.360
 the more beautiful you are tracking 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.520
 just died by me that is exaggerated 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.810
 and arrogant but oh well we win and now 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.889
 I had a 9 point three 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.440
 but the farmers match in the base 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.060

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.410
 he can learn to see who you might 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.660
 just below him little as he passed through one 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.979

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.800

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.210
 camp yes those things happen yes and 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.440
