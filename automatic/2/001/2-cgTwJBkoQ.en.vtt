print shop in 1999 and organized the
shop<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.250> would<00:00:34.370> be<00:00:34.490> a<00:00:34.520> comfortable

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
included making it less toxic because I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.660 
included making it less toxic because I
knew<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:44.870> would<00:00:45.170> be<00:00:45.200> here<00:00:45.560> for<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.829> long<00:00:46.010> time<00:00:46.280> and

knew I would be here for a long time and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.540 
knew I would be here for a long time and
I<00:00:47.360> wanted<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.900> maintain<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.380> safe<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.190> healthy

different<00:00:57.290> places<00:00:57.820> either<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.850> have<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.180> clear

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
different places either I have a clear

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.870 
different places either I have a clear
concept<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.170> what<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.350> want<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:00.680> make<00:01:00.950> or<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.610> can

concept of what I want to make or I can

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.610 
concept of what I want to make or I can
just<00:01:02.090> start<00:01:02.300> creating<00:01:02.510> components<00:01:03.290> without<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
just start creating components without a

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.439 
just start creating components without a
clear<00:01:03.890> idea<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.309> how<00:01:04.489> I'm<00:01:04.609> going<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.939> use<00:01:05.179> them

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
clear idea of how I'm going to use them

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.710 
clear idea of how I'm going to use them
and<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.639> looks<00:01:07.639> really<00:01:07.819> good

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and that looks really good

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
and that looks really good
I<00:01:13.250> acquired<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> number<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> mediums<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I acquired a number of mediums to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
I acquired a number of mediums to
experiment<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.260> from<00:01:16.620> an<00:01:16.740> art<00:01:16.920> supply

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
experiment with from an art supply

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.720 
experiment with from an art supply
catalog<00:01:17.520> including<00:01:18.420> tar<00:01:18.690> gel<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.580> had<00:01:20.580> never

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
catalog including tar gel I had never

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.880 
catalog including tar gel I had never
worked<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.120> it<00:01:21.210> before<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.500> my<00:01:22.650> nature

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
worked with it before but it's my nature

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
worked with it before but it's my nature
to<00:01:23.160> play<00:01:23.370> with<00:01:23.550> things<00:01:23.760> and<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> figure<00:01:24.480> out

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to play with things and to figure out

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
to play with things and to figure out
what<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.590> used<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:27.140> or<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.410> reason

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
what they can be used for or some reason

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.250 
what they can be used for or some reason
I<00:01:29.040> decided<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.000> an<00:01:30.150> ink<00:01:30.330> plate<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
I decided to put it on an ink plate to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.030 
I decided to put it on an ink plate to
see<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.620> would<00:01:31.770> happen<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:34.260> flowed<00:01:34.590> into<00:01:34.830> all

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
see what would happen it flowed into all

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
see what would happen it flowed into all
the<00:01:35.160> grooves<00:01:35.310> picking<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.330> ink<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the grooves picking up the ink and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.040 
the grooves picking up the ink and
making<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.320> most<00:01:37.500> fabulous<00:01:37.710> impressions

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.690 

suddenly<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:43.080> had<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> stretchy<00:01:43.860> translucent

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
suddenly I had a stretchy translucent

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
suddenly I had a stretchy translucent
edging<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.510> could<00:01:45.810> form<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> use<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> make

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
edging that I could form and use to make

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
edging that I could form and use to make
3d<00:01:47.190> prints

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.490 

generally<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> piece<00:01:55.270> evolves<00:01:55.870> over<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.200> period

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.860 
generally a piece evolves over a period
of<00:01:56.680> months<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.370> work<00:01:57.970> on<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.180> number<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.660> pieces

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
of months I work on a number of pieces

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.930 
of months I work on a number of pieces
adding<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.710> them<00:01:59.860> over<00:02:00.010> time<00:02:00.130> until<00:02:00.820> they

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
adding to them over time until they
