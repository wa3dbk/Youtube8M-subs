00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
constantly hold a button another thing I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.630 
constantly hold a button another thing I
like<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.830> remote<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> has<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
like about this remote is that has a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.039 
like about this remote is that has a
really<00:01:18.210> long<00:01:18.390> cord

really long cord

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.980 
really long cord
I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.189> 16<00:01:20.790> feet<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.840> Hayes

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I think it's about 16 feet so your Hayes

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
I think it's about 16 feet so your Hayes
machine<00:01:22.290> doesn't<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.070> under

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
machine doesn't have to be right under

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
machine doesn't have to be right under
the<00:01:24.450> table<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:24.900> anything<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.560> really

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the table or anything so that's really

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.740 
the table or anything so that's really
nice<00:01:26.130> another<00:01:26.880> cool<00:01:27.119> feature<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.570> Hayes

it's heating up and once it turns blue

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's heating up and once it turns blue
that<00:01:42.000> means<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.390> ready<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> haze<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.950> heat

fast<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.600> has<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> very<00:03:52.989> high-powered<00:03:53.739> fan<00:03:54.100> and

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
fast it has a very high-powered fan and

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.759 
fast it has a very high-powered fan and
it<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:54.910> fill<00:03:55.150> pretty<00:03:55.870> much<00:03:55.989> any<00:03:56.319> size<00:03:56.530> menu

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
it can fill pretty much any size menu

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.099 
it can fill pretty much any size menu
pretty<00:03:57.100> fast<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:57.760> good<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> better<00:03:58.840> view<00:03:59.079> of

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
pretty fast it's good a better view of

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.270 
pretty fast it's good a better view of
that

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.760 
that
you<00:04:00.520> see<00:04:00.850> you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.060> barely<00:04:01.390> even<00:04:01.540> see<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.990> very

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
you see you can barely even see it very

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.300 
you see you can barely even see it very
fine<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:04.660> feels<00:04:04.990> like<00:04:05.170> air<00:04:05.380> but<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.069> coming

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
fine just feels like air but it's coming

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.640 
fine just feels like air but it's coming
out<00:04:06.520> it's<00:04:06.940> coming<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.240> pretty<00:04:07.420> fast<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.020> as

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
out it's coming out pretty fast and as

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.280 
out it's coming out pretty fast and as
you<00:04:08.770> can<00:04:08.890> see<00:04:09.069> it's<00:04:09.840> already<00:04:10.840> filled<00:04:11.140> this

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
you can see it's already filled this

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.949 
you can see it's already filled this
room<00:04:11.470> pretty<00:04:11.709> much<00:04:12.090> had<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.120> machine<00:04:13.510> on<00:04:13.660> for

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
room pretty much had the machine on for

room pretty much had the machine on for
two<00:04:14.440> minutes<00:04:14.740> max<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.550> entire<00:04:15.880> room<00:04:16.269> is

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
two minutes max and the entire room is

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.860 
two minutes max and the entire room is
just<00:04:17.290> filled<00:04:17.680> with<00:04:17.950> fog<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.630> beams

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
just filled with fog and that the beams

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 
just filled with fog and that the beams
of<00:04:20.079> light<00:04:20.200> are<00:04:20.380> very<00:04:20.709> crisp<00:04:21.160> if<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.730> have<00:04:22.030> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
of light are very crisp if you have a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.240 
of light are very crisp if you have a
regular<00:04:22.540> fog<00:04:22.750> machine<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.680> don't<00:04:23.800> really<00:04:24.010> get

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
regular fog machine you don't really get

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.520 
regular fog machine you don't really get
that<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.550> kind<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.880> get<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.240> beams<00:04:25.480> are<00:04:25.720> sort

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
that you kind of get the beams are sort

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.170 
that you kind of get the beams are sort
of<00:04:26.590> choppy<00:04:27.040> because<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.610> fog<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.150> thick

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
of choppy because the fog is so thick

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.940 
of choppy because the fog is so thick
and<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.840> hasn't<00:04:29.169> hang<00:04:29.440> in<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> air<00:04:29.710> as<00:04:29.919> long

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
and it hasn't hang in the air as long

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.820 
and it hasn't hang in the air as long
but<00:04:30.700> these<00:04:30.850> beams<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.360> really<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.500> crisp

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
but these beams are really really crisp

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.200 
but these beams are really really crisp
and<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.640> really<00:04:33.910> tell<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.180> difference

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
and you can really tell the difference

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.090 
and you can really tell the difference
between<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:35.110> haze<00:04:35.380> machine<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.860> fog

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
between the haze machine in the fog

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.520 
between the haze machine in the fog
machine<00:04:36.220> and<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:37.540> haze<00:04:37.720> machine<00:04:38.110> does

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
machine and this haze machine does

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.150 
machine and this haze machine does
really<00:04:38.980> well<00:04:39.250> with<00:04:39.990> providing<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.169> atmosphere

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
really well with providing a atmosphere

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.980 
really well with providing a atmosphere
that<00:04:42.730> it's<00:04:42.850> good<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:43.210> effect<00:04:43.480> lights<00:04:43.690> but

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
that it's good for effect lights but

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
that it's good for effect lights but
it's<00:04:44.110> still<00:04:44.880> comfortable<00:04:45.880> for<00:04:46.419> your<00:04:47.290> your

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
it's still comfortable for your your

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.270 
it's still comfortable for your your
crowd<00:04:48.280> or<00:04:48.550> your<00:04:48.850> guests<00:04:49.919> it's<00:04:50.919> which<00:04:51.160> is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
crowd or your guests it's which is

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.310 
crowd or your guests it's which is
really<00:04:51.760> nice<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.210> get<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.600> best<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.200> both

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
really nice and get the best of both

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.420

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
worlds so you see the beams of light are

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.030 
worlds so you see the beams of light are
very<00:04:57.760> crisp<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.479> it<00:04:59.110> does<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.530> affect<00:04:59.979> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
very crisp and it does not affect the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
questions about just do haze machines

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.200 
questions about just do haze machines
make<00:05:04.870> effect<00:05:05.560> lights<00:05:05.770> seem<00:05:06.490> less<00:05:06.729> bright<00:05:07.030> and

make effect lights seem less bright and

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.270 
make effect lights seem less bright and
that<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.419> totally<00:05:08.050> not<00:05:08.260> true
