old one album sucked he couldn't tell

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
old one album sucked he couldn't tell
like<00:01:46.710> especially<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.520> push<00:01:47.700> play<00:01:47.909> video<00:01:48.210> was

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
like especially my push play video was

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
like especially my push play video was
like<00:01:48.920> gross<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.250> yellow<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> pixely<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
like gross and yellow and pixely and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
like gross and yellow and pixely and
made<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> weird<00:01:52.439> sound<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> background

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
made that weird sound in the background

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.999 
made that weird sound in the background
but<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:55.979> right

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
but I think they got a good one right

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.800 
but I think they got a good one right
here<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.670> awkward<00:01:57.030> filming<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> first

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
here it's awkward filming that first

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
here it's awkward filming that first
part<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> video<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:59.729> neighbors

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
part of the video because my neighbors

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730 
part of the video because my neighbors
that<00:02:00.390> are<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.750> front<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.110> me<00:02:01.229> always<00:02:01.350> put
