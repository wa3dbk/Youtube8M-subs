 I bring you a new map and that brings this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.179
 map this maps very explained a little house 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.179
 with a door 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.090
 I care guys so it's natural 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.490
 good 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.490
 the travel returns 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.200
 ah 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.590
 it does not sound 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 I could bet that they liked it 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.870
 my little house is very epic is very 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 epic 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.600
 5 You're in my life to see her 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.059
 and good guys here we are with the map 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.399
 is the house always only for some 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.280
 that they think that the map is not the map is 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.170
 this is a pretty big map it's like 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.290
 an empire more or less protected with 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.509
 walls of 500 blocks good me 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.070
 throwing them people is very good the map 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.509
 I suggest you download them and I'm going to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.970
 show a bit but how am I recording 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.510
 this beauty and luck pisses me 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.910
 computer 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.310
 and good they will see the map is very ethical 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.600
 It's quite big, they make us popular 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 the two meters 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 they lower us these 4 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.200
 it is a map as if it had been done in a 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.870
 Mountain is pretty but pretty big 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.030
 quite interesting not 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.620
 expect me to load some of this for 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.780
 that you can see the map of truth 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.370
 I suggest you download it here 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.020
 make us a hole pvp that is 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.750
 pretty good on a server also the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 map and it is a proper opinion they are not going to 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.010
 see how they realize the city 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.680
 has the first stages as the first 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.420
 wall the second wall the second wall the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.720
 global well third quarter two points wall 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.460
 which is the third wall and here is the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 fourth wall that is to say they are like 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.020
 different stages I do not know if I explain myself 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.770
 ok here is the fifth wall I think 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.900
 is the last one does not go the sixth wall and this 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.450
 it is the last one as you can see and if they are given 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.370
 account is a pass this map is 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.090
 quite big I know that what attracts most 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.520
 to me at least guys is this was 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.860
 too peak I was born around here more or 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.270
 less 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.760
 over here I 'm a shit piece of shit 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.280
 that is pure capital I do not like it I do not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 like I do not like benitez does not look 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.140
 need and think about killing myself guys 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.140
 and sometimes 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.680
 they say it says 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.260
 I tried to kill myself but here they say 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.670
 says try and I saw all the others 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.790
 for which it is quite epic as 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.769
 can see super high 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.810
 I love that, that's what I like the most 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.340
 map that has as 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.010
 let's go a little boys forgiveness 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.510
 fan but good just for 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.540
 show them a little what this is what 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 more it catches my attention from afar 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.120
 Pucha that what good looks are going to see a 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.640

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.870
