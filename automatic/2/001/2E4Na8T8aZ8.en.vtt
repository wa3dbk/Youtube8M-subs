to<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.879> now<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> did<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.919> I<00:02:48.919> intentionally

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
to be now what I did is I intentionally

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.569 
to be now what I did is I intentionally
only<00:02:50.389> looked<00:02:50.750> at<00:02:50.900> plot<00:02:51.260> points<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.739> dt<00:02:52.099> which

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
only looked at plot points in dt which

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.890 
only looked at plot points in dt which
is<00:02:52.699> probably<00:02:52.879> why<00:02:53.060> I'm<00:02:53.120> not<00:02:53.239> as<00:02:53.389> height<00:02:53.659> is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
is probably why I'm not as height is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.349 
is probably why I'm not as height is
about<00:02:54.109> water<00:02:54.469> service<00:02:54.769> if<00:02:54.889> he<00:02:54.980> not

about water service if he not

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.159 
about water service if he not
intentional<00:02:56.359> is<00:02:56.419> because<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.780> intentionally

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
intentional is because I intentionally

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.099 
intentional is because I intentionally
start<00:02:57.620> like<00:02:58.359> bullshitting<00:02:59.359> around<00:02:59.480> episodes

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109
