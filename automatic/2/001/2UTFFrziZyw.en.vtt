hi<00:00:05.460> I'm<00:00:05.670> Kenny<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.240> many<00:00:06.390> ball<00:00:06.600> design<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hi I'm Kenny for many ball design and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.169 
hi I'm Kenny for many ball design and
today<00:00:07.410> I'm<00:00:07.649> hold<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> back<00:00:08.490> deck<00:00:08.760> again

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
today I'm hold on the back deck again

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.799 
today I'm hold on the back deck again
still<00:00:10.050> working<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.590> nipple<00:00:10.920> cap<00:00:11.630> and<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.780> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
still working on my nipple cap and now I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.589 
still working on my nipple cap and now I
got<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.889> new<00:00:14.400> set<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> valves<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.360> mail

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
got a new set of valves in the mail

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.550 
got a new set of valves in the mail
today

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490 

these<00:00:21.160> are<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.490> brass<00:00:21.789> ones<00:00:23.580> but

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
these are the brass ones but

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.850 
these are the brass ones but
unfortunately<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:28.410> after<00:00:29.410> they<00:00:29.680> were<00:00:29.739> in

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
unfortunately they after they were in

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.970 
unfortunately they after they were in
the<00:00:29.980> alcohol<00:00:30.340> while<00:00:30.699> they<00:00:31.619> didn't<00:00:32.619> work<00:00:32.770> well

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
the alcohol while they didn't work well

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.530 
the alcohol while they didn't work well
at<00:00:33.160> all<00:00:33.280> none<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.699> none<00:00:33.940> of<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.150> valves<00:00:34.449> have

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
at all none of none of the valves have

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.820 
at all none of none of the valves have
worked<00:00:34.809> well<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:36.550> was<00:00:36.850> slow<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.269> to<00:00:37.839> open<00:00:38.680> up

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
worked well they was slow to to open up

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.009 
worked well they was slow to to open up
and<00:00:39.070> they<00:00:39.580> were<00:00:39.730> slow<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.030> close<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:40.720> that<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
and they were slow to close so that the

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.369 
and they were slow to close so that the
fuel<00:00:41.290> would<00:00:41.440> pull<00:00:41.680> back<00:00:41.890> up<00:00:42.129> again<00:00:42.400> I<00:00:43.379> just

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
fuel would pull back up again I just

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.990 
fuel would pull back up again I just
don't<00:00:44.589> think<00:00:44.860> that<00:00:44.949> any<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.370> these<00:00:45.519> dolls<00:00:45.820> are

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
don't think that any of these dolls are

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.210 
don't think that any of these dolls are
designed<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.510> work<00:00:46.659> with<00:00:46.870> methanol<00:00:47.440> under<00:00:48.190> a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
designed to work with methanol under a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.310 
designed to work with methanol under a
really<00:00:48.519> low<00:00:48.879> forward<00:00:49.449> and<00:00:49.600> backward<00:00:50.019> pressure

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
really low forward and backward pressure

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.259 
really low forward and backward pressure
they<00:00:51.010> work<00:00:51.220> better<00:00:51.430> with<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> higher<00:00:51.879> pressure

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
they work better with a higher pressure

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.109 
they work better with a higher pressure
I'm<00:00:53.019> they<00:00:53.379> work<00:00:53.530> better<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:54.129> water<00:00:54.519> or<00:00:54.670> if

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
I'm they work better with water or if

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.579 
I'm they work better with water or if
they<00:00:55.449> don't<00:00:55.570> work<00:00:55.780> good<00:00:55.809> with<00:00:56.170> methanol<00:00:56.680> and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
they don't work good with methanol and

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.549 
they don't work good with methanol and
somebody<00:00:59.589> suggested<00:01:00.220> using<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.850> vit<00:01:01.360> o<00:01:01.659> n<00:01:02.170> how

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
somebody suggested using the vit o n how

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.829 
somebody suggested using the vit o n how
to<00:01:02.860> pronounce<00:01:03.040> it<00:01:03.369> I<00:01:03.549> checked<00:01:04.119> on<00:01:04.299> that<00:01:04.330> and

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
to pronounce it I checked on that and

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.690 
to pronounce it I checked on that and
that's<00:01:05.320> not<00:01:05.500> compatible<00:01:06.159> with<00:01:06.189> methanol

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
that's not compatible with methanol

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.240 
that's not compatible with methanol
leader<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.270> fact<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.380> only<00:01:08.409> thing<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.770> found<00:01:08.979> so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
leader in fact the only thing I found so

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.490 
leader in fact the only thing I found so
far<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.670> compatible<00:01:10.270> with<00:01:10.420> methanol<00:01:10.869> is<00:01:11.110> a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
far this compatible with methanol is a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.160 
far this compatible with methanol is a
silicon<00:01:12.460> same<00:01:13.119> thing<00:01:13.330> my<00:01:13.479> tubing<00:01:13.869> is<00:01:13.960> made

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
silicon same thing my tubing is made

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.230 
silicon same thing my tubing is made
Adam<00:01:14.470> that's<00:01:15.280> neither<00:01:15.460> hint<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
Adam that's neither hint of that I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.090 
Adam that's neither hint of that I
decided<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:19.170> rather<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.500> keep<00:01:20.710> pursuing

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
decided that rather to keep pursuing

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.850 
decided that rather to keep pursuing
this<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.729> just<00:01:21.880> spending<00:01:22.869> sixty<00:01:23.350> dollars<00:01:23.710> to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
this and just spending sixty dollars to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.620 
this and just spending sixty dollars to
this<00:01:23.890> set<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.340> valves<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.850> said<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.270> know<00:01:25.390> I

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
this set of valves and said you know I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.450 
this set of valves and said you know I
spent<00:01:26.109> over<00:01:26.350> three<00:01:26.530> hundred<00:01:26.619> dollars<00:01:27.130> just<00:01:27.280> on

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
spent over three hundred dollars just on

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.459 
spent over three hundred dollars just on
valves<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.420> haven't<00:01:28.659> had<00:01:28.719> one<00:01:28.899> work<00:01:29.140> yet

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
valves and I haven't had one work yet

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.440 
valves and I haven't had one work yet
are<00:01:30.280> they<00:01:30.429> work<00:01:30.609> in<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.820> beginning<00:01:31.210> but<00:01:31.329> they

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
are they work in the beginning but they

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.730 
are they work in the beginning but they
don't<00:01:31.630> work<00:01:31.840> after<00:01:32.320> they've<00:01:32.439> been<00:01:32.590> in

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
don't work after they've been in

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.179 
don't work after they've been in
methanol<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.520> anyway<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:34.380> started<00:01:35.380> looking<00:01:35.890> at

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
methanol so anyway I started looking at

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.849 
methanol so anyway I started looking at
ways<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.819> do<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.450> without<00:01:38.200> running<00:01:38.710> a

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
ways to do this without running a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.910 
ways to do this without running a
methanol<00:01:39.390> through<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.020> valve<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.499> know<00:01:41.649> that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
methanol through the valve I know that

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.849 
methanol through the valve I know that
sounds<00:01:42.280> crazy<00:01:42.429> but<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:44.109> finally<00:01:44.530> figured

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
sounds crazy but and I finally figured

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.039 
sounds crazy but and I finally figured
out<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.100> way<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.340> do<00:01:45.609> it<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:45.909> I<00:01:46.390> think<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.749> solves

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
out a way to do it and I think it solves

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.249 
out a way to do it and I think it solves
two<00:01:47.469> or<00:01:47.920> three<00:01:48.130> problems<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.999> actually<00:01:49.929> moves

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
two or three problems and actually moves

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.870 
two or three problems and actually moves
the<00:01:50.530> remote<00:01:50.979> feed<00:01:51.280> alcohol<00:01:51.729> stove<00:01:52.149> ahead<00:01:53.049> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the remote feed alcohol stove ahead a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.520 
the remote feed alcohol stove ahead a
significant<00:01:54.880> amount<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.780> let<00:01:56.079> me<00:01:56.200> pull<00:01:56.409> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
significant amount so let me pull the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.319 
significant amount so let me pull the
camera<00:01:56.740> in<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.219> closer<00:01:57.429> in<00:01:57.789> sure<00:01:58.060> yeah

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
camera in a little closer in sure yeah

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:06.650 
camera in a little closer in sure yeah
what<00:01:59.049> I'm<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.289> to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990 

okay<00:02:07.660> what<00:02:07.870> I've<00:02:08.020> done<00:02:08.289> here<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.679> I've<00:02:09.670> taken

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
okay what I've done here is I've taken

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.290 
okay what I've done here is I've taken
my<00:02:10.390> nipple<00:02:10.780> cap<00:02:11.820> this<00:02:12.820> little<00:02:13.120> hole<00:02:13.270> here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
my nipple cap this little hole here

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.490 
my nipple cap this little hole here
doesn't<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.110> way<00:02:14.140> through<00:02:14.470> i

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
doesn't go all the way through i

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.750 
doesn't go all the way through i
actually<00:02:14.950> had<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.100> post<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.360> pull<00:02:16.600> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
actually had a post in that to pull the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.370 
actually had a post in that to pull the
hose<00:02:18.760> off<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.300> stick<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.570> over<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.050> for

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
hose off and stick it over it for

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.030 
hose off and stick it over it for
storage<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:20.800> i<00:02:21.070> decided<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:23.040> anyway

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
storage but i decided not to so anyway

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.160 
storage but i decided not to so anyway
this<00:02:24.220> cap<00:02:24.540> I've<00:02:25.540> pressed<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:27.870> diaphragm<00:02:28.870> valve

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this cap I've pressed a diaphragm valve

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.930 
this cap I've pressed a diaphragm valve
right<00:02:29.470> into<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> valve<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.459> oriented

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
right into it and the valve is oriented

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.910 
right into it and the valve is oriented
so<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.240> air<00:02:31.360> will<00:02:31.540> travel<00:02:31.959> into<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> bottle

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
so the air will travel into the bottle

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.910 
so the air will travel into the bottle
but<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.130> can't<00:02:33.340> come<00:02:33.520> out<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:35.050> what<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
but it can't come out so what you do is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.250 
but it can't come out so what you do is
when<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.490> ready<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> fill<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.180> stove<00:02:37.570> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.460 

you<00:02:41.260> tilt<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.620> bottle<00:02:41.980> up<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:44.410> know

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
you tilt the bottle up and I know

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.250 
you tilt the bottle up and I know
whether<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.550> not<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:47.110> those

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
whether you can see it or not see those

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.830 
whether you can see it or not see those
air<00:02:47.500> bubbles<00:02:47.970> okay<00:02:48.970> those<00:02:49.180> air<00:02:49.360> bubbles<00:02:49.390> are

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
air bubbles okay those air bubbles are

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.620 
air bubbles okay those air bubbles are
rushing<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.730> alcohol<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.239> rushing

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
rushing in and the alcohol is rushing

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.160 
rushing in and the alcohol is rushing
out<00:02:52.750> filling<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> stove<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:56.470> fills<00:02:56.770> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
out filling the stove and it fills it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.290 
out filling the stove and it fills it
they<00:02:59.170> turn<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.950> over<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.370> you're<00:03:00.790> done<00:03:03.300> now

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
they turn it over and you're done now

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.720 
they turn it over and you're done now
this<00:03:04.570> actually<00:03:05.500> fills<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.010> stove<00:03:06.280> quite<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
this actually fills the stove quite a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.650 
this actually fills the stove quite a
bit<00:03:06.940> faster<00:03:07.510> than<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.800> can<00:03:09.040> do<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:10.209> with<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
bit faster than you can do just with the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.320 
bit faster than you can do just with the
squeezing<00:03:11.200> motion<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.730> don't<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.150> to

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
squeezing motion and you don't have to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.240 
squeezing motion and you don't have to
squeeze<00:03:13.600> anything<00:03:13.989> all<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.560> do<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.040> turn

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
squeeze anything all you do is just turn

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.150 
squeeze anything all you do is just turn
it<00:03:15.570> upside<00:03:16.570> down<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.900> hang<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.680> you

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it upside down and hang on to it you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.710 
it upside down and hang on to it you
might<00:03:18.400> have<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.730> squeeze<00:03:19.000> about<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
might have to squeeze about just a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.100 
might have to squeeze about just a
little<00:03:20.500> bit<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.709> get<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.890> started<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:22.110> then

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
little bit to get it started and then

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.080 
little bit to get it started and then
the<00:03:25.200> air<00:03:26.200> rushes<00:03:26.769> in<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.220> alcohol<00:03:27.370> rushes

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
the air rushes in and the alcohol rushes

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
the air rushes in and the alcohol rushes
out<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.560> little<00:03:29.860> bit<00:03:29.980> fast<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.700> large

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
out it's a little bit fast for the large

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.030 
out it's a little bit fast for the large
lines<00:03:31.600> i'm<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.260> try<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.940> with<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
lines i'm going to try it with the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.830 
lines i'm going to try it with the
smaller<00:03:36.040> microline<00:03:36.880> i<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.450> might<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.660> a

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
smaller microline i think it might be a

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.190 
smaller microline i think it might be a
little<00:03:38.049> more<00:03:38.230> user-friendly<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.840> i<00:03:41.049> think

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
little more user-friendly but i think

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.280 
little more user-friendly but i think
that's<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.709> fairly<00:03:41.980> simple<00:03:43.380> way<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:45.070> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that's a fairly simple way to do it and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.870 
that's a fairly simple way to do it and
that<00:03:47.290> way<00:03:47.500> there's<00:03:47.860> no<00:03:47.920> alcohol<00:03:48.250> going

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
that way there's no alcohol going

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.509 
that way there's no alcohol going
through<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.360> valves<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> they<00:03:50.380> operate<00:03:50.860> very

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
through the valves and they operate very

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.170 
through the valves and they operate very
well<00:03:51.880> with<00:03:52.120> air<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:53.200> uh<00:03:53.640> that's<00:03:54.640> what<00:03:54.880> I'm<00:03:55.000> up

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
well with air so uh that's what I'm up

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.780 
well with air so uh that's what I'm up
to<00:03:55.209> I've<00:03:56.140> also<00:03:56.380> got<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.799> stove<00:03:57.100> here<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.549> burns

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
to I've also got a stove here that burns

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.990 
to I've also got a stove here that burns
about<00:03:58.209> 10<00:03:58.780> minutes<00:03:59.049> between<00:03:59.500> fills<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.790> if<00:04:00.880> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
about 10 minutes between fills so if you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.580 
about 10 minutes between fills so if you
tilt<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.420> up<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.900> fill<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.230> put<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.470> back

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
tilt this up and fill it put it back

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.710 
tilt this up and fill it put it back
down<00:04:02.620> you're<00:04:03.370> good<00:04:03.610> for<00:04:03.760> at<00:04:03.880> least<00:04:04.120> 10<00:04:04.510> minutes

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
down you're good for at least 10 minutes

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.560 
down you're good for at least 10 minutes
at<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.410> full<00:04:05.799> rolling<00:04:06.130> boil<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:07.299> I'm<00:04:07.390> pretty

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
at a full rolling boil so I'm pretty

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.060 
at a full rolling boil so I'm pretty
good<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> I'm<00:04:08.350> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> keep<00:04:08.890> working

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
good with that I'm going to keep working

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.620 
good with that I'm going to keep working
on<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.760> see<00:04:09.820> what<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.150> can<00:04:10.209> come<00:04:10.329> up<00:04:10.510> with

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
on that and see what I can come up with

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.020 
on that and see what I can come up with
see<00:04:11.620> if<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.769> can<00:04:11.950> improve<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.579> i'm<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
see if I can improve on it i'm going to

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.000 
see if I can improve on it i'm going to
keep<00:04:13.180> using<00:04:13.959> this<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.739> if<00:04:14.799> there's

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
keep using this to see if there's

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.190 
keep using this to see if there's
anything<00:04:15.310> that's<00:04:15.639> going<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.000> go<00:04:16.630> wrong<00:04:16.900> with

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
anything that's going to go wrong with

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.930 
anything that's going to go wrong with
it<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:18.160> i<00:04:18.190> think<00:04:18.430> that's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
it so i think that's

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.810 
it so i think that's
anything<00:04:19.209> for<00:04:19.420> today<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:20.620> did<00:04:21.370> go<00:04:21.549> up<00:04:21.610> this

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
anything for today I did go up this

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.860 
anything for today I did go up this
morning<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.450> start<00:04:23.200> building<00:04:24.190> em<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.420> SB

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
morning and start building em to SB
