it to me I think probably this morning
and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:27.269> tried<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> few<00:00:28.830> minutes<00:00:28.920> ago<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and I tried it out a few minutes ago and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.780 
and I tried it out a few minutes ago and
it<00:00:29.550> worked<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.390> funny<00:00:31.040> because<00:00:32.040> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it worked and it's so funny because it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.979 
it worked and it's so funny because it's
the<00:00:32.969> way<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.149> walk<00:00:33.270> around<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> guys<00:00:33.809> don't

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the way you walk around you guys don't

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.690 
the way you walk around you guys don't
see<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> mean<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.579> like

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
see what I mean but I really really like

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
see what I mean but I really really like
this<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.410> simple<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.920> do

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this one and it's really simple to do

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
this one and it's really simple to do
now<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.660> I've<00:00:39.780> seen<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
now from what I've seen all you need to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
now from what I've seen all you need to
do<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> skateboard<00:00:41.750> on<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
do is have a skateboard on you and I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.160 
do is have a skateboard on you and I
guess<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.430> if<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> guys<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.539> skateboard<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
guess so if you guys can skateboard and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400 
guess so if you guys can skateboard and
I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.530> let<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.860> check<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:48.410> yeah

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I think let me check here actually yeah

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
I think let me check here actually yeah
so<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.739> must<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> membership<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.350> order

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so you must have a membership in order

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.119 
so you must have a membership in order
to<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> skateboard<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
to get a skateboard so I think this is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
to get a skateboard so I think this is
the<00:00:56.430> only<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> works<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> works

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the only way it works but if it works

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
the only way it works but if it works
without<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.559> skateboard<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.640> let<00:00:59.879> me<00:00:59.969> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
without a skateboard then let me know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.510 
without a skateboard then let me know
but<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> need<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> skateboard

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
but I think all you need is a skateboard

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.479 
but I think all you need is a skateboard
and<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.650> yeah<00:01:05.070> let<00:01:05.250> me<00:01:05.280> show<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and that is it so yeah let me show you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
and that is it so yeah let me show you
guys<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.080> guys<00:01:07.830> are
