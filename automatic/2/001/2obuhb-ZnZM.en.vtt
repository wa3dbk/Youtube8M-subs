00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
take your hand out and use I know that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.520 
take your hand out and use I know that
our<00:02:39.270> different<00:02:39.600> products<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.260> use

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
our different products that you can use

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
our different products that you can use
I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:40.830> white<00:02:41.070> vinegar<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.760> use<00:02:41.880> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
I think white vinegar you can use to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720 
I think white vinegar you can use to
remove<00:02:42.870> stains<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.950> think<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
remove stains but I think this is the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
remove stains but I think this is the
fastest<00:02:45.150> way<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> found<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:48.870> bleach

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
fastest way that I found so also bleach

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.820 
fastest way that I found so also bleach
makes<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.760> hands<00:02:51.120> dry<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.620> are

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
makes your hands dry out so if you are

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.350 
makes your hands dry out so if you are
gonna<00:02:52.950> put<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.250> nails<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.640> after<00:02:54.000> don't

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
put lotion on because that will make

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.660
