00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160 
different gear changes I'm beginning to
realize<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.610> although<00:02:12.760> mode<00:02:13.480> one<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
realize that although mode one the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
realize that although mode one the
slowest<00:02:14.770> change<00:02:15.160> might<00:02:15.580> give<00:02:15.880> your

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
slowest change might give your

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.440 
slowest change might give your
passengers<00:02:16.630> next<00:02:17.170> slightly<00:02:17.890> easier<00:02:18.370> time<00:02:18.700> you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
passengers next slightly easier time you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
passengers next slightly easier time you
can<00:02:19.570> actually<00:02:19.690> make<00:02:20.020> even<00:02:20.500> smoother<00:02:21.160> changes

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
can actually make even smoother changes

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.660 
can actually make even smoother changes
in<00:02:21.790> mode<00:02:22.150> six<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.810> fastest<00:02:23.620> change<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.490> may

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
in mode six the fastest change just may

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.180 
in mode six the fastest change just may
give<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.000> lift<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:25.990> throttle<00:02:26.320> we

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
give a little lift of the throttle we

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
give a little lift of the throttle we
just<00:02:27.340> demonstrated<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:28.300> like<00:02:28.480> third<00:02:28.810> gear
