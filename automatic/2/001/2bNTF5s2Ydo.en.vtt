 Oil oil on the mobile super wet 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.449

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.870
 we are going to put a milk cup 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.630
 and there we are going to start incorporating 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.559
 simple super rich pudding today I imagine 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.559

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.490
 Now it's been said we had honey 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.100
 then a very good honey is coming 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.560
 because now we are going to use the best honey 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.290
 and in the most practical way because with 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.340
 the new packaging of vioey we do not 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.640
 more worse thanks to your valve 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.800
 anti-drip simplifies the use of the product 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.860
 allowing us to explain accurately if 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.009
 use spoon just what 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.730

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.310
 we press look how easy 90 degrees there 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 there it is there it falls more or less 2 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.220
 teaspoons without goop ar super easy and 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
 we're going to use it because it's a honey 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.860
 prairie coming mainly from 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.250
 thistle flowers alfalfa and clover 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.520
 Plain Pampa plain color flavor 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.240

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.250
 Uncle Way Honey with certified quality and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.250
 natural honey and a month 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.090
 apart all barbarian clean 2 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.300
 teaspoons of honey and now we are going to 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.320
 add flour when three little houses 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.190
 leavening flour if we add there the 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.780
 flour 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:13.910
 the rates the coffee with milk rates 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.460
 the big dates and the cup of coffee with 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.220
 milk you will use perfectly and simply 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.110
 remember this is all medium for rates and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.830
 there are times we tell you quantities 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.830
 now I tell you rates but also 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 but there is nobody 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.070
 because we have to take care of the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.980
 city 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.900
 in this winter ginger and cascaritas 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.690
 of orange because you remember that you have 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.350
 oranges and now that the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.350
 oranges 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.250
 live we put 2 oranges with their 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.970
 choirs and I bring that if something is left after 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.709
 of the margin of trying to use tomorrow 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.390
 because it is also a good option if 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.560
 apart super healthy because the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.300
 quadrant we made with oil 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.300
 like this world 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.970
 we go down here we have the gÃ¼inera list what 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.330
 what we do is simply put all the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.150
 preparation in this case in this plan 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.110
 lower the butter 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.580
 surely it is not necessary because it is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.710
 list 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.830
 now when I finished this one what 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:44.250
 We send to a furnace pay attention to a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.689
 160 170 degrees oven that we already heat 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.150
 important we do not heat it up makes a 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:53.789
 hour that is not like hell fire 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.789
 the oven has to be at moderate 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.430
 40 minutes
