monsters are named by the asterism ass
rooms<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.829> basic<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.600> formulation<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
rooms are just basic the formulation of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.369 
rooms are just basic the formulation of
those<00:00:43.110> stars<00:00:43.440> come<00:00:43.890> together<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.379> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
those stars come together as one so you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.340 
those stars come together as one so you
see<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.860> comparison<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.640> comes<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
see a little comparison when it comes to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
see a little comparison when it comes to
yugioh<00:00:49.350> turn<00:00:49.649> where<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.910> have

the<00:00:56.670> asterism<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.629> archive<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> very

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the asterism this archive is very

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
the asterism this archive is very
similar<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.390> concealers<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:01.379> their

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
similar to the concealers with their

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.310 
similar to the concealers with their
artwork<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.550> their<00:01:02.789> name<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> even<00:01:04.110> with

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
artwork with their name and even with

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
artwork with their name and even with
their<00:01:04.439> place<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.700> shocking<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> see

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
their place up is not shocking to see

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
their place up is not shocking to see
why<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:07.350> satellites<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.189> basically

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
why these satellites are basically

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.679 
why these satellites are basically
asterism<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.500> concealers<00:01:11.100> are

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
asterism in the concealers are

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
asterism in the concealers are
constellations<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.250> similar

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
constellations so there are very similar

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
constellations so there are very similar
up<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.509> stars<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> earth<00:01:16.380> atmosphere

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
up in my stars of the earth atmosphere

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
up in my stars of the earth atmosphere
and<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.759> strong<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.240> find<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.720> similar

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
and a strong will find them very similar

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
and a strong will find them very similar
in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.909> though<00:01:21.210> their

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
in the way of work though their

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
in the way of work though their
formation<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.710> move<00:01:23.460> together<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.330> only

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
formation to move together the only

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
formation to move together the only
difference<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.430> asterism<00:01:26.430> our<00:01:26.610> burial<00:01:27.000> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
difference that asterism our burial is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
difference that asterism our burial is
much<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> smaller<00:01:28.110> group<00:01:28.380> compared<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
much a smaller group compared to the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
much a smaller group compared to the
constellation<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.110> said<00:01:31.320> before<00:01:31.439> all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
constellation like I said before all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.569 
constellation like I said before all
just<00:01:32.369> tellin<00:01:32.909> eyes<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.329> basis<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.560> similar<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
just tellin eyes are basis of similar to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
just tellin eyes are basis of similar to
Devon<00:01:35.700> Stellar's<00:01:36.200> even<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.350> their<00:01:37.470> play

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
Devon Stellar's even with their play

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980 
Devon Stellar's even with their play
style<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.400> their<00:01:38.970> objectives<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.540> basically

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
style and their objectives is basically

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.580 
style and their objectives is basically
performed<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.240> wait<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.540> someone<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.110> fast<00:01:43.439> as

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
performed a wait for someone as fast as

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.010 
performed a wait for someone as fast as
possible<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> MC<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.840> the
