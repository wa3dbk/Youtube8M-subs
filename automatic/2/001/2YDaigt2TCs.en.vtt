00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
like I said in my previous video I've

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.670 
like I said in my previous video I've
got<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.400> admit<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.150> very<00:00:36.540> good

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
got to admit I'm not a very good

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.080 
got to admit I'm not a very good
realtime<00:00:37.680> strategy<00:00:37.739> player<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.730> simply

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
realtime strategy player because simply

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.080 
realtime strategy player because simply
I<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.420> haven't<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.690> gotten<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.410> so

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
I just haven't really gotten into it so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.900 
I just haven't really gotten into it so
anyway<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.870> idea<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.609> Age<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
anyway the idea is here much like Age of

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.000 
anyway the idea is here much like Age of
Empires<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.449> any<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> those<00:00:45.809> sort<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> games

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
Empires or any of those sort of games

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
Empires or any of those sort of games
where<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.640> whole<00:00:47.879> bunch<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.239> people

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
where you have a whole bunch of people

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
where you have a whole bunch of people
that<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.109> control<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> can

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that you can control here and you can

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.560 
that you can control here and you can
ask<00:00:50.370> them<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> build<00:00:50.910> things<00:00:51.149> based<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.510> your

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
