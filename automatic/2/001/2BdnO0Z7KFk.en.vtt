00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
trees on the short list very old and I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.330 
trees on the short list very old and I
guess<00:00:45.329> there's<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:46.710> substitute<00:00:47.309> for

experience<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:48.149> you're<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> tree<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.200> mean

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
experience when you're a tree but I mean

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.600 
experience when you're a tree but I mean
I<00:00:49.559> guess<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> worry<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I guess you worry that you're not really

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
I guess you worry that you're not really
encouraging<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> young<00:00:51.390> trees<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.870> none<00:00:52.020> get

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
encouraging the young trees if none get

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139

tree<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> year<00:01:03.750> how<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.010> trees

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
tree of the year how much of these trees

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.850 
tree of the year how much of these trees
got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> change<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.630> next<00:01:07.140> year<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.619> mean<00:01:07.740> that

got a change by next year I mean that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
got a change by next year I mean that
surely<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.880> decade<00:01:09.530> at<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:11.100> least<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:12.360> all

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
surely a decade at the very least is all

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.800 
surely a decade at the very least is all
that's<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.710> needed<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.000> sincerely

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
absolute mess looking at it I reckon if

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.219 
absolute mess looking at it I reckon if
it<00:01:21.299> does<00:01:21.390> win<00:01:21.570> it'll<00:01:21.720> show<00:01:21.869> there's<00:01:22.080> match
