00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
somewhere now and then maybe we can make

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.580 
somewhere now and then maybe we can make
a<00:03:23.400> good<00:03:23.670> end<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.390> last<00:03:24.720> two<00:03:24.870> overseas<00:03:25.320> and

this was changed now since I'm not

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.920 
this was changed now since I'm not
racing<00:04:29.190> him<00:04:29.280> about<00:04:29.460> there's<00:04:30.270> missing<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.750> few

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
racing him about there's missing a few

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.510 
racing him about there's missing a few
good<00:04:31.110> guys<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.440> orders<00:04:31.680> Villopoto<00:04:32.100> missing

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
riders are missing now so I think that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.200 
riders are missing now so I think that
makes<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.890> big<00:04:38.100> change<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:38.790> championship

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
makes a big change for the championship

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.340 
makes a big change for the championship
of<00:04:39.450> course<00:04:40.040> but<00:04:41.040> yeah<00:04:42.000> in<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.510> moment<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:43.170> don't

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
of course but yeah in a moment I don't

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810 
of course but yeah in a moment I don't
know<00:04:43.410> what's<00:04:43.650> going<00:04:43.860> running<00:04:44.220> wrong<00:04:44.490> with

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
know what's going running wrong with

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.090 
know what's going running wrong with
this<00:04:44.940> sport<00:04:45.240> why<00:04:45.390> everybody<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:45.990> injured<00:04:46.410> but

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
this sport why everybody is injured but

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.090 
this sport why everybody is injured but
we<00:04:47.910> still<00:04:48.150> need<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.540> find<00:04:49.500> maybe<00:04:49.800> different

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
we still need to find maybe different

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370 
we still need to find maybe different
way<00:04:50.340> maybe<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> case<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.480> not<00:04:51.780> going<00:04:52.110> wrong

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
way maybe it's a case of not going wrong

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.600 
way maybe it's a case of not going wrong
with<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> sport<00:04:52.890> but<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.070> might<00:04:53.220> be<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> case<00:04:53.550> of

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
with the sport but it might be a case of

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.850 
with the sport but it might be a case of
just<00:04:53.790> unlucky<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:54.870> do<00:04:55.050> not<00:04:55.260> know<00:04:55.320> what's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
just unlucky you just do not know what's

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.750 
just unlucky you just do not know what's
going<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.040> happen<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.340> mean<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.550> don't<00:04:56.700> know

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
going to happen I mean you don't know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.950 
going to happen I mean you don't know
what's<00:04:56.910> going<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.060> happen<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.420> weekend<00:04:57.810> it

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
what's going to happen this weekend it

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.780 
what's going to happen this weekend it
could<00:04:58.110> be<00:04:58.200> good<00:04:58.290> or<00:04:58.350> bad<00:04:58.800> but<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.220> guess<00:04:59.580> that's

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
could be good or bad but I guess that's

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.700 
could be good or bad but I guess that's
what<00:05:00.060> makes<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:00.630> exciting<00:05:00.660> in<00:05:01.230> a<00:05:01.290> way<00:05:01.320> no

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
what makes it so exciting in a way no

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.810 
what makes it so exciting in a way no
one<00:05:01.740> really<00:05:02.070> knows<00:05:02.190> what's<00:05:02.520> around<00:05:02.700> the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
one really knows what's around the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.820 
one really knows what's around the
corner<00:05:02.850> quite<00:05:03.570> literally<00:05:03.840> yeah<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.590> course

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
corner quite literally yeah of course

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.800 
corner quite literally yeah of course
for<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.100> spectators<00:05:05.280> from<00:05:06.180> outside<00:05:06.630> that's

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
for the spectators from outside that's

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.350 
for the spectators from outside that's
looking<00:05:07.320> fantastic<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.400> know<00:05:08.430> but<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
looking fantastic you know but the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.960 
looking fantastic you know but the
actual<00:05:09.660> speed<00:05:10.170> what's<00:05:10.830> in<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.130> moment<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.640> so

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
actual speed what's in a moment is so

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.720 
actual speed what's in a moment is so
high<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.420> makes<00:05:12.660> quite<00:05:12.960> dangerous<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.190> maybe

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
high it makes quite dangerous so maybe

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.330 
high it makes quite dangerous so maybe
that's<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.090> reason<00:05:15.270> why<00:05:15.450> but<00:05:15.810> we<00:05:16.710> are

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
that's the reason why but we are

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.310 
that's the reason why but we are
professional<00:05:18.060> sports<00:05:18.390> people<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:18.840> we<00:05:18.990> have<00:05:19.170> to

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
professional sports people so we have to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.480 
professional sports people so we have to
deal<00:05:19.530> with<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.720> get<00:05:21.720> or<00:05:22.020> find<00:05:22.290> a<00:05:22.410> way<00:05:22.590> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
deal with it and get or find a way to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.580 
deal with it and get or find a way to
win<00:05:23.850> races<00:05:24.090> but<00:05:24.480> don't<00:05:24.720> get<00:05:24.900> injured<00:05:25.050> that's

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
win races but don't get injured that's

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.920 
win races but don't get injured that's
difficult<00:05:25.910> exactly<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.060> part<00:05:27.390> of<00:05:27.570> dealing

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
difficult exactly but part of dealing

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.210 
difficult exactly but part of dealing
with<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:28.260> dealing<00:05:28.560> with<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.770> injury<00:05:29.070> as

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
with it is dealing with the injury as

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.500 
with it is dealing with the injury as
well<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.550> dealing<00:05:29.850> with<00:05:29.970> that<00:05:30.060> frustration

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
well and dealing with that frustration

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.260 
well and dealing with that frustration
and<00:05:30.930> everything<00:05:31.440> but<00:05:31.980> uh<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.430> know<00:05:32.730> last<00:05:33.030> time
