tables are really expensive on the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.510 
tables are really expensive on the
server<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:25.560> costs<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.040> 20k

place<00:01:49.979> where<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> mind<00:01:50.640> bedrock<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.979> for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
place where I mind bedrock and it's for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.209 
place where I mind bedrock and it's for
like<00:01:53.520> many<00:01:53.759> reasons<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.450> getting<00:01:55.350> into<00:01:55.829> like

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
like many reasons like getting into like

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.770 
like many reasons like getting into like
it<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.759> giving<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> others<00:01:57.479> sometimes

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it just giving to others sometimes

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590 
it just giving to others sometimes
bedrock<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.430> their<00:01:59.579> base<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
bedrock to for their base and so on and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
bedrock to for their base and so on and
my<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.259> bases<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.219> made<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
my all my bases are I think made of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.719 
my all my bases are I think made of
bedrock<00:02:03.119> except<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.009> bedrock

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
bedrock except one this is all bedrock

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.320 
bedrock except one this is all bedrock
the<00:02:06.030> previous<00:02:06.689> wasn't<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.229> also<00:02:07.649> but<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.970> kind
