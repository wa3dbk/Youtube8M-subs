stopping<00:00:47.190> power<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> gun<00:00:47.879> right<00:00:48.090> here

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
stopping power on this gun right here

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
stopping power on this gun right here
miss<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> m4<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.250> doesn't<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.910> much<00:00:51.180> damage

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
miss the m4 it doesn't have much damage

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.040 
miss the m4 it doesn't have much damage
so<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:53.160> good<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> use<00:00:53.579> stop<00:00:53.820> power<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so it's good to use stop power on it to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.919 
so it's good to use stop power on it to
increase<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> damage<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:55.980> bit

actually<00:01:35.289> not<00:01:35.679> much<00:01:35.800> people<00:01:36.039> know<00:01:36.130> about<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
actually not much people know about it

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.090 
actually not much people know about it
but<00:01:36.759> when<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.090> get<00:01:37.240> throw<00:01:37.539> it<00:01:37.950> makes<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
but when you get throw it makes the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
if you don't have a total bitch or a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.289 
if you don't have a total bitch or a
Dolby<00:01:53.200> surround<00:01:53.440> headset<00:01:53.560> or<00:01:53.890> anything<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.430 
Dolby surround headset or anything it's
still<00:01:55.479> useful<00:01:55.720> because<00:01:56.020> if<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.259> have<00:01:56.409> a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
still useful because if you have a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.840 
still useful because if you have a
normal<00:01:56.649> television<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.369> still<00:01:57.700> hear

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
normal television you can still hear

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.340 
normal television you can still hear
people<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.780> still<00:01:58.959> hear<00:01:59.110> if<00:01:59.229> they're

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
people and you can still hear if they're

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.800 
people and you can still hear if they're
around<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.770> somewhere<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:01.569> makes<00:02:01.720> it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
around you somewhere and it makes it

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.859 
around you somewhere and it makes it
louder<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.300> kind<00:02:04.599> of<00:02:04.750> a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
louder so it's just that it's kind of a

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:14.249 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.129

this guy coming with my sitrep so I

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.230 
this guy coming with my sitrep so I
decided<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.680> take<00:06:20.800> them<00:06:20.979> out<00:06:21.099> quickly<00:06:21.460> with

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
decided to take them out quickly with

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.619 
decided to take them out quickly with
the<00:06:22.800> akimbo<00:06:24.539> g18<00:06:25.539> okay<00:06:25.960> yeah<00:06:26.259> it<00:06:26.409> was<00:06:26.529> g18<00:06:27.629> one

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
the akimbo g18 okay yeah it was g18 one

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.409 
the akimbo g18 okay yeah it was g18 one
of<00:06:28.719> my<00:06:28.779> favorite<00:06:29.080> of<00:06:29.169> chemo<00:06:29.409> guns<00:06:29.620> by<00:06:29.979> the<00:06:30.039> way

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
of my favorite of chemo guns by the way

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.119 
of my favorite of chemo guns by the way
it's<00:06:31.419> pretty<00:06:31.930> quick<00:06:32.199> I<00:06:32.409> don't<00:06:32.770> like<00:06:32.830> steady

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 
it's pretty quick I don't like steady

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.249 
it's pretty quick I don't like steady
aim<00:06:33.310> on<00:06:33.490> it<00:06:33.610> because<00:06:33.879> the<00:06:34.539> recoil<00:06:34.900> is<00:06:35.020> pretty

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
aim on it because the recoil is pretty

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.200 
aim on it because the recoil is pretty
high<00:06:35.439> so<00:06:35.830> if<00:06:36.009> you<00:06:36.159> use<00:06:36.430> steady<00:06:36.639> aim<00:06:36.759> on<00:06:36.909> it<00:06:37.090> you

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
high so if you use steady aim on it you

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.719 
high so if you use steady aim on it you
need<00:06:37.360> like<00:06:37.740> major<00:06:38.740> accuracy<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.550> kill

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
need like major accuracy to kill

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.600 
need like major accuracy to kill
somebody<00:06:39.969> with<00:06:40.150> it<00:06:40.590> so<00:06:41.590> I<00:06:41.620> prefer<00:06:41.889> to<00:06:42.189> just<00:06:42.219> use

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
somebody with it so I prefer to just use

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.429 
somebody with it so I prefer to just use
that<00:06:42.639> silence<00:06:43.240> or<00:06:43.389> something<00:06:43.719> worse<00:06:43.930> or

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:44.439 
that silence or something worse or

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.240 
that silence or something worse or
something<00:06:45.039> else<00:06:46.560> and<00:06:47.560> here<00:06:47.860> we<00:06:47.889> got<00:06:48.039> a<00:06:48.069> nice

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
something else and here we got a nice

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.589 
something else and here we got a nice
final<00:06:48.580> kill<00:06:48.759> take<00:06:49.000> out<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.240> claim<00:06:49.419> with<00:06:49.569> a
