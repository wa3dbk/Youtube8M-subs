00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.110 
mindset when he first got there I just
had<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.920> change<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.610> way<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.790> looked<00:02:22.000> at

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
had to change the way I looked at

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
had to change the way I looked at
basketball<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.110> buying<00:02:23.470> what<00:02:23.739> he<00:02:23.800> was

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
basketball in and buying what he was

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.080 
basketball in and buying what he was
trying<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.129> get<00:02:24.220> done<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.459> once<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.879> did<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
trying to get done and once I did that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
trying to get done and once I did that
it<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.780> really<00:02:26.050> smooth<00:02:26.290> ride<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.860> what's

devastating was out for them
it<00:02:34.840> was<00:02:34.959> tough<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.590> was<00:02:35.650> tough<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.040> I'm<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
it was tough it was tough but I'm a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.949 
it was tough it was tough but I'm a
getting<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.640> great<00:02:37.209> coach<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.540> coach<00:02:37.750> Turgeon

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
getting a great coach and coach Turgeon

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.660 
getting a great coach and coach Turgeon
and<00:02:38.350> they<00:02:38.650> got<00:02:38.800> some<00:02:38.950> great<00:02:39.250> group<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.520> guys

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and they got some great group of guys

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.430 
and they got some great group of guys
coming<00:02:39.880> back<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.020> think<00:02:41.080> they<00:02:41.260> should

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
coming back and so I think they should

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.130 
coming back and so I think they should
be<00:02:41.530> fine<00:02:41.709> next<00:02:42.010> season<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.580> he<00:02:43.569> left<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.050> in

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
be fine next season and he left it in

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.300 
be fine next season and he left it in
the<00:02:44.230> great<00:02:44.380> situation<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.920> think<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.100> hitting

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the great situation I think the hitting

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.980 
the great situation I think the hitting
the<00:02:45.370> way<00:02:45.459> they're<00:02:45.910> headed<00:02:46.120> right<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.300> us<00:02:46.720> to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
the way they're headed right for us to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.059 
the way they're headed right for us to
