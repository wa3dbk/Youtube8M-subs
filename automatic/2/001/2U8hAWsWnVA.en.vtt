00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.750
 Marat performed on the coolest 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.570
 intermot exhibition in europe this year 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.369
 performed with chris fayfer and represented 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230
 tell Russia at this event 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.970
 Generally your impressions that you brought 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.560
 I learned maybe I had the honor 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.939
 represent Russia on really 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.810
 the largest international exhibition 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.600
 intermot 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 was very happy about this new experience for me 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.010
 never skated europe more and more 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.780
 Russia in Russia is very interesting 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.239
 event was well organized by 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.160
 several shows a day I rode in a team 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.249
 with the Dutch rider name option 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.679
 grafon riding a harley motorcycle 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:42.769
 davidson is not often used for sleeping 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.870
 trolling type mutation when also 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.979
 skated kris pfeifer other 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.399
 Riders think very worthy showed 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.559
 there was clearly a middle 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.989
 pure riding style looked like they 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.309
 ride ride as we noted that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.809
 something in the stunt riding and going 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.850
 some appear new trick or in 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.400
 principle here well here we go at level 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.500
 all the same but the level of skating 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.140
 our corridors are not worse than in Europe 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 absolutely sure that is here on 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.719
 riders who become often championship 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.110
 which aspire 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.210
 we have our good level guys and here 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.680
 German riding style he is different then 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.270
 there she spends germany he has his 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.820
 handwriting for a certain style is still 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.509
 more such old school tricks little jump off 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.310
 few quick changes here combinations yes but 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.299
 very good quality riders in 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.729
 mainly represent 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.710
 Motsyk summer brands ie one raider 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.689
 rolls roll for example someone for 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.600
 husqvarna someone for april someone for 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.090
 suzuki tata motorcycles all very well 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.820
 prepared practically look like 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.460
 stock very little external screw where 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.649
 lady and minimum minimum of external changes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.829
 I can say that out of 12 people who 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.170
 performed were only 2 classes 636 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.119
 the rest of the motorcycle were all absolutely 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.859
 which we do not see in the market has become 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.649
 pharmacists all these stereotypes are already by 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.649
 to a large extent a remnant of debt 4 5 6 6 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.149
 this one but probably they are comfortable for riders 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.310
 who do not roll for the brand 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.090
 motorcycle but if riders tours 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 him 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 the company offers a sponsorship contract 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 he chooses a brand for example suzuki then he 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.599
 forced to choose motorcycles marat you there 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.599
 anyway surprised everyone with his mods yes 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.720
 in general , he will tell about his employees 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.319
 start varna 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.360
 this is husqvarna sm 511 originally 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.580
 born as supermoto now has two 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.410
 absolutely prepared the same 2 clones 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.150
 two motorcycles which I have one 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 training other main i can them 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.340
 use to go 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:46.700
 the bike is a bit heavier than the previous one 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.799
 May cf and mach w and this is both a plus and a minus 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.360
 it is different gearbox that is 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.180
 transmissions shorter than blast y 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.680
 man was a plus in that first 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.640
 the transfer is very long bargain here 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.620
 The first is short, that's why the cartoon 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.260
 very angry i like beautiful design i 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.760
 preferred this time they do not change 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.829
 the back part is to have a motorcycle 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.230
 looked heavier so that 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.810
 possible there was less change here external 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.709
 in boogie lipton about cf it was easy 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.700
 very powerful cheeky furious motorcycles 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.230
 husqvarna 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.790
 she is heavier motor more elastic 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.769
 for stunt riding maybe of course 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.019
 easier still doing tricks on it 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.900
 why here supermoto but in the world not the most 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.329
 popular class in trolling though 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.819
 really looks cool from all the tricks 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.250
 we have this unusual work seems to me 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.989
 senal expands because you can 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 a little bit about frodo connect some 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.290
 jump there to one in a hangout syrup in the world 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.200
 but the plane seats are still highways on 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.000
 motorcycle and so were ponderous 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.639
 that is, people seem to me just 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.959
 more like it later on sports 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.650
 motorcycles which are basically 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.239
 drivers are used for performances in 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.109
 between still wide tank wide 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.419
 the seat 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.060
 cell there are so many places where you 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.220
 you can climb poison sit down so on us 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.099
 format harder I have to 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.780
 jump on a very narrow seat and there 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.910
 do some footboards for yourself here 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.299
 possibilities are limited for some 3 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.859
 for example if you make a spacer here 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.539
 she looks different then fresh 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.210
 I sit on the seat I have a gas tank and no 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.669
 strut on a motorbike scene and hitch those 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.380
 for some reason they practically deal swing 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.289
 because he looks ridiculous at the very 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.849
 business for supermoto Muratov did you 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.219
 it turns out in the season constantly what 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.890
 event performance fest this not 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.260
 considers tournaments sports question it 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.760
 When you train in progressing 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.710
 mostly progress I have is in winter 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.120
 when I train now we have 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.750
 the opportunity to train closed 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.270
 carting circuit 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.370
 we used to go to Sochi in the summer of course I 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.500
 also I keep fit but progressing 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.909
 don't do anything risky because 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.430
 I can bring partners who 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:59.590
 invite to the event now our 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:03.460
 the team does about 40 shows per season and 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.450
 about 20 shootings of various TV shows 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.039
 films so it is practically 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.610
 performances occur two times in 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:14.030
 week tightest schedule yes moving 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.580
 but there is simply no time for it, so here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.469
 all the same now we already have a goal is not a victory 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.360
 competition yes precisely participation 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.599
 maintain your level and quality 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.599
 show
