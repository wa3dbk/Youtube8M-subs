00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:14.509
 so hello tell you about my experience 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.800
 Valdai operation 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:21.619
 car valdai great cummins 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 level 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:35.540
 engine compartment means trouble 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:41.510
 started with the house here's native pipe 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 ripped on 20 thousand and half 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 the stores did not find anything 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 put this one means 245 is sealed I 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:08.700
 did it like this and put it this way 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.100
 passed means well a couple of thousand came here 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.880
 a little more 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 burst it is absolutely not reinforced 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.950
 just rubber these this reinforced 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.009
 inside you can see fibers and filaments 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:33.979
 when the burst's this combination was 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:39.840
 350 rubles silicone price and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 trouble started means too weak 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.299
 tightening the clamp leads to the fact that his 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:53.159
 takes off but as soon as I tightened it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:58.200
 as it should, and here she vomited here 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:01.649
 see almost in half how with this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.439
 I donâ€™t know yet to fight 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.640
 I will still have a new pipe 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:12.170
 set 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.650
 then I will do the following 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 until 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:22.250
 this way you have to work means here 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.250
 drilled a hole in the pipe clamp 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:33.590
 a piece of plastic 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:37.460
 Now I will install a new approach and this 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.959
 hole and looked as if este 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.709
 the car then gradually bit it a little 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:53.150
 for the crown half pushed this 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 petal although we want me to be 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.270
 confidence that I will finish 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.650
 wives from place to place that's because his 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.300
 regular pipe rupture 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:13.269
 which in our store unfortunately already 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:17.680
 run out can mean union work and 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.680
 as a result loss of profit 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.400
 so mustache 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.400
 amplify something else these connections 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.840
 maybe it makes sense but i'm afraid then what 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.100
 if you put some kind of powerful pipe 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.790
 find such i'm afraid then calling myself 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.980
 cooler 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.100
 that is, an aluminum radiator that there 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.410
 often happens on our machines 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.530
 so here is the hole she will 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.260
 serve as a trap for me 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.709
 for overpressure 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.130
 let's see what happens if someone 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.200
 came across this 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.320
 tell me in the comments I will 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.540
 welcome any advice 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.080
 can someone come in handy my experience all up 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.080
 dates thanks
