that's good for society I think that is
after<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.069> first<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:32.000> Sessions<00:02:32.330> Court<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
after the first the Sessions Court that

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.360 
after the first the Sessions Court that
is<00:02:34.010> correct<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.000> has<00:02:35.599> there<00:02:35.780> been

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
is correct that is so has there been

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.630 
is correct that is so has there been
changing<00:02:37.370> tide<00:02:37.580> after<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.410> bail<00:02:39.640> sometimes

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
changing tide after the bail sometimes

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.820 
changing tide after the bail sometimes
what<00:02:40.790> also<00:02:40.970> happens<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:42.019> when<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.440> person

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830
