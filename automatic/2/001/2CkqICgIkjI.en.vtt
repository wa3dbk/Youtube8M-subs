00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.750
 hello my name is arches ivan you 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.190
 Watch the video site revolverlab.com 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.620
 Today we have a review of the device 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.570
 unusual even by modern standards 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.299
 and we will talk about asus transformer 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.700
 2 unusual hybrid laptop and tablet 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.619
 which works on full windows 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.109
 8 device comes here 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.119
 beautiful box opening the top cover 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.430
 you will surely be a little surprised and 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.410
 you will see the tablet part 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.199
 this device and everything would be fine 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.210
 13.3 diagonal 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.610
 very impressive especially considering 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.620
 what's in front of you tablet if you compare 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.629
 in size with other tablets the difference 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.309
 visible to the naked eye next in 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.589
 power adapter kit 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.479
 They are carefully packed the most important 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.159
 Part of this device is keyboard dock 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.320
 the station which turns it into 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.729
 a full-fledged asus laptop pampers its 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.379
 users and bundled with 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.000
 The device comes with a case in the form of 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.769
 envelope where you can put 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.629
 laptop for safer 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.850
 transportation how to position 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.869
 This device I would say that asus 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.640
 transformer book 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.619
 This is primarily a full-fledged laptop 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.720
 with the ability to transform into 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.130
 a tablet which by the way even without a dock 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.500
 station retains all the functionality 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 full computer remember those dashing 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.190
 times when with the advent of the first 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 tablets people wondered 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.940
 whether the tablet can replace them 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.340
 full computer can now be with 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.420
 with confidence to answer yes may asus 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.190
 transformer book 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.410
 very similar to previous devices 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.170
 companies and in design and materials 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.450
 the case is a mixture of a ruler 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 zenbook laptops and asus tablets 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.740
 vivopc dock housing is made of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.050
 aluminum assembly everything is fine 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.110
 there is a feeling of solidity here 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.930
 there are two usb outlets micro hdmi and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.370
 sd card slot and even network 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.550
 ethernet interface to connect 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.650
 network cable besides the company asus 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.080
 focuses on the bin sound system 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.880
 gunn dawson speakers which carefully 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.950
 hidden on the lower side faces 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.060
 The tablet part is also sharpened in 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 aluminium case 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.110
 there is a large active hole in the back 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.909
 cooling which is to my pleasure 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.920
 surprise 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.020
 has a low sound barrier therefore 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.479
 even under heavy load the device is not 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.849
 the front part is noisy and does not heat up 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.110
 display covered with protective glass display 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.010
 with a diagonal of 13.3 solution 1920 to 1080 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.110
 points 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 has a high brightness and in general 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.440
 leaves only positive 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360
 experience in communicating with the device and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.220
 now it's time to tell how and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.140
 the most important thing is what does this 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.239
 an unusual machine to tell the truth 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.830
 price factor devices two in one or 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.629
 as the company asus calls them 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.610
 transformer am i treated more like 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.590
 mobile devices and nothing much 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.299
 Specifications not expected in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.860
 the beginning of this review, I do not just like that 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.989
 said it should be evaluated as 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.549
 watch the full laptop yourself 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.549
 the heart of this device is 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.010
 core i7 processor with a clock speed of 1 and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.379
 9 gigahertz also exists younger 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.629
 model with a core i5 processor inside of 5 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.609
 4 gigabytes of RAM per 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.349
 graphics oddly responds chip 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.720
 intel hd 4000 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.640
 but the most amazing thing is that in 13 inch 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.980
 device found a place 2 hard 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.950
 drive system disk ssd solid state 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.510
 128 gigabyte drive and also 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.010
 500 gigabyte hard drive with 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.220
 expandable up to 1 terabyte 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.599
 it seems to me for a miniature 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.010
 13-inch device is just 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.380
 excellent with such technical 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.630
 characteristics of asus transformer book 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.450
 may well be with macbook air from 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.620
 Apple's all the stuffing device 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 located in and off of the laptop 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.180
 so disconnecting the screen dock you 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.989
 will continue to work in full 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.269
 windows environment 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.980
 for this reason the manufacturer was 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 forced to abandon passive 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.940
 cooling due to good old cooler 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.680
 and large sash hoods 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.359
 asus transformer book is fine 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.040
 copes with a lot of 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.930
 everyday tasks for all time 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.669
 I did not notice the use of the device 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.919
 significant braking or 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.750
 hangs photoshop work passes 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.430
 fairly smoothly such tasks as 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.590
 surfing the internet work with office 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.139
 docs or watching video full hd 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.599
 The format is quite possible by the way. 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.310
 he could not play some games 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.590
 although you must understand that everything is there 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 rests on the graphics chip intel hd 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.859
 4000 and run on this laptop 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.140
 demanding 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.420
 and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.970
 not worth special attention deserves 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.950
 keyboard and touchpad device perhaps 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.180
 one of the most comfortable keyboards among 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.760
 notebooks on the operating system 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.739
 windows ergonomic ease of entry 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.840
 I can only compare with the companyâ€™s laptops 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.000
 sony random hit rate 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.160
 adjacent keys minimum touchpad 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.990
 responsive perfectly fulfills the function with 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.880
 trolling with two fingers plus everything 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.350
 programmed with certain gestures 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.160
 using special software 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.720
 ensure 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.060
 asus now let's talk about the screen 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.550
 device or rather about his permission 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.800
 it just so happens that with a diagonal of 13 and three 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.180
 inch full hd resolution you 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.190
 literally have to 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.020
 peer into the text of course if you 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.940
 not ultra vision but it's not a problem 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.040
 just recommend to go directly to 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.800
 display settings and zoom with 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.720
 increasing to 100 or 150 percent in 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.120
 the rest of the screen has excellent viewing angles 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.740
 big and even violent sunshine you 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.320
 can work while on the street 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.760
 now a few words about windows 8 i know 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.220
 that among our viewers and readers 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.230
 there are a lot of people who put it mildly not 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.030
 are supporters of this version 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.870
 operating system can say one thing 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.300
 exactly 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.370
 subway interface in the form of tiles perfectly 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.169
 adapted to control with your fingers and 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.910
 touch part of the screen on asus 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.790
 transformer to be here like never before 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.440
 although the question is different or consumers 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.330
 so wanted to see touch 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.669
 laptops that microsoft company was 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.290
 forced to make such an interface or 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.090
 manufacturers are forced to let out 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.370
 sensory devices because companies 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.930
 microsoft banged to the head that worthy 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.490
 systems must be managed by 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.229
 fingers please write in 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.300
 comments what exactly do you think by 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.280
 it remains to discuss the most 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.720
 sick topic that concerns any 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.770
 a laptop that works under 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.780
 running windows 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.060
 battery life speaking 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.250
 about the technical component of the situation 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.650
 looks like this in the dock 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.750
 fit 5000 battery capacity 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.000
 milliampere hour and immediately located 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.760
 500 gigabyte hard drive tablet 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.740
 has a battery capacity of 3100 20 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.110
 milliampere hour at the same time when the device 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.150
 assembly the tablet will not charge from 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.010
 docking station as all the energy goes away 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.930
 to work hard drive and all 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.940
 functional outputs but if translated 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.340
 tablet to sleep it will start to eat 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.560
 from docking station in full mode 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.560
 laptop included wifi when working 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.210
 browser and office suite attach 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.280
 and the laptop keeps about five with 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.050
 half hours in tablet mode when 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.760
 the same load honest four with 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.800
 half an hour asus cost 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.300
 transformer 2 about one and a half thousand 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.700
 dollars for the money you get 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.860
 sufficiently productive laptop with 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.330
 impressive memory capacity and most importantly with 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.810
 opportunity to turn it into a not 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.060
 an ordinary tablet with a diagonal of 13.3 tim 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.660
 all the advantages and disadvantages of the device 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.760
 + and 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.070
 good performance excellent 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.210
 display versatility convenient 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.040
 keyboard and touchpad 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.990
 quality sound from the speakers and 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.180
 quite good working time compared to 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.950
 other solutions on windows to minuses 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.820
 I would like to include the dimensions and weight 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.530
 devices 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.389
 the thing is that for constructive 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.700
 features of asus transformer book 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.710
 thick enough and the weight of the device in 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.050
 compilation is almost two kilograms
