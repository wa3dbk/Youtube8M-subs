00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
let's be honest I'm pretty sure all of

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.810 
let's be honest I'm pretty sure all of
our<00:01:37.990> deaths<00:01:38.200> occur<00:01:38.410> like<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.800> so<00:01:39.490> usually

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
our deaths occur like that so usually

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.340 
our deaths occur like that so usually
that's<00:01:39.970> basically<00:01:40.480> checking<00:01:40.690> social<00:01:41.080> media

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
that's basically checking social media

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.070 
that's basically checking social media
like<00:01:41.530> YouTube<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.340> other<00:01:42.580> stuff<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.270> after<00:01:44.050> I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
like YouTube and other stuff so after I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.540

will<00:01:44.260> realize<00:01:44.650> that<00:01:44.830> I'm<00:01:44.920> pretty<00:01:45.190> late<00:01:45.400> so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
will realize that I'm pretty late so

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.280 
will realize that I'm pretty late so
