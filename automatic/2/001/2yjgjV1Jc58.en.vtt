00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.610
 accepting a heated setting 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.130
 competitive game very different right 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.810
 I like it a lot too but I have a lot 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.269
 that learning is mainly for

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.070
 I know if to attack or whether or not 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.070
 I do not know what can and can not 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.940
 He was a human enemy . 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.940

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:14.640
 the U1 killed over a very good kid but 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.940
 He does not want to die, I do not want 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.940

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.690
 kill back the almost killed boy 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.310
 and then I have to travel the maps well and 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.810

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.370

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.680
 Your little hand remembering that I'm going to play. 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.640
 within the standards however the team 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 Changed some things, right? 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.720
 the guy who soon enough 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.460
 strategy goes the galera with will wrap 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.570

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.570
 sides 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.000
 I believe in this capiroto joke. 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.460
 It's even going to be the monkey thing. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.450
 so it will be slower than another 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.550
 thing so let's get what it is 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.690
 I do not even know where to go. 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.690

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.690

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.890
 it has several zin spikes 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.070

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:53.960

00:06:45.590 --> 00:07:05.270
 several sinister peaks there I'm Jewish 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:08.770

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.940
 I need to train if I'm not going to take a cassette. 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:30.700
 in this game, and kept the motto not that 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.700
