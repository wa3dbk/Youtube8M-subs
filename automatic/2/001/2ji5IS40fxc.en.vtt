one of my tutorials and today we are
going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.200> build<00:00:10.200> ourselves<00:00:10.490> my<00:00:11.750> damp<00:00:12.750> farm

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
going to build ourselves my damp farm

going to build ourselves my damp farm
mark<00:00:14.070> 3<00:00:15.170> this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.560> slightly<00:00:17.400> altered

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
mark 3 this is a slightly altered

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
mark 3 this is a slightly altered
version<00:00:17.910> from<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> previous<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.350> which<00:00:19.529> I've

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
version from the previous one which I've

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
version from the previous one which I've
showed<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.910> only<00:00:21.090> thing<00:00:21.330> that's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
showed you the only thing that's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.240 
showed you the only thing that's
different<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.740> actually<00:00:22.859> use

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
different is that they actually use

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.269 
different is that they actually use
fence<00:00:23.580> gates<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.980> lever<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.849> simplicity

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
fence gates and a lever for simplicity

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
fence gates and a lever for simplicity
so<00:00:29.279> let<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.699> show<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.420> works

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
so let me show you how this one works

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.700 
so let me show you how this one works
real<00:00:30.869> fast<00:00:32.300> walk<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.200> notice<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
real fast walk up you notice that it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.959 
real fast walk up you notice that it
looks<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.760> want

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
looks pretty good in there that you want

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.819 
looks pretty good in there that you want
to<00:00:36.030> take<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> stuff<00:00:36.739> flip<00:00:37.739> switch<00:00:38.300> head<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.450> in

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
to take the stuff flip switch head on in

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.240 
to take the stuff flip switch head on in
get<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.100> loot<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.860> before<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> leave

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
get all your loot and before you leave

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.060 
get all your loot and before you leave
you<00:00:44.700> fill<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> land<00:00:51.320> close<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.530> gates<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you fill the land close the gates if you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.810 
you fill the land close the gates if you
want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.710> put<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> land<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
want to and put the land back down and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
want to and put the land back down and
it<00:00:57.090> should<00:00:59.180> you<00:01:00.180> should<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.690> perfectly<00:01:01.079> fine

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it should you should be perfectly fine

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.959 
it should you should be perfectly fine
after<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
after that

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
after that
ok<00:01:02.969> let's<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.420> ahead<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.040> start<00:01:05.040> building<00:01:05.430> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
ok let's go ahead and start building one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.200 
ok let's go ahead and start building one
in<00:01:05.700> ourselves

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
in ourselves

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
in ourselves
this<00:01:06.960> model<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.260> 10<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.280> 6<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.350> 10

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
this model is it's a 10 by 6 so it's 10

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
this model is it's a 10 by 6 so it's 10
long<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:14.070> 6<00:01:14.340> wide<00:01:14.930> we're<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
long by 6 wide we're actually going to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.719 
long by 6 wide we're actually going to
use<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.189> space<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
use a little bit of this space for the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.899 
use a little bit of this space for the
switch<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.869> 11<00:01:19.320> by<00:01:19.470> 6<00:01:19.909> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
switch as well so it's about 11 by 6 so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.429 
switch as well so it's about 11 by 6 so
let's<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.020> start<00:01:22.229> digging

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
let's go on over here and start digging

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.210 
let's go on over here and start digging
our<00:01:22.650> hole<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> start<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.799> 4<00:01:26.490> wide

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
down here and dig out a couple of side

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.600 
down here and dig out a couple of side
paths<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:01.360> these<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.920> gonna<00:02:03.070> fill<00:02:03.400> them

paths and in these we're gonna fill them

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.660 
paths and in these we're gonna fill them
with<00:02:03.640> redstone

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.480 

okay<00:02:11.830> directly<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:12.890> front<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.250> redstone

they both work I mean okay those stalks
will<00:04:34.230> be<00:04:34.320> able<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.560> grow<00:04:34.740> because<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
will be able to grow because of the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.640 
will be able to grow because of the
glass<00:04:35.880> above<00:04:36.180> them<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.540> also<00:04:37.350> they'll<00:04:37.530> be

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
glass above them and also they'll be

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.620 
glass above them and also they'll be
able<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:37.950> give<00:04:38.460> off<00:04:38.610> fruit<00:04:39.000> because<00:04:39.419> there's

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
able to give off fruit because there's

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.320 
able to give off fruit because there's
glass<00:04:40.229> above<00:04:40.590> them<00:04:40.830> there's<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.370> solid<00:04:41.610> block<00:04:41.940> I

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
glass above them there's a solid block I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.420 
glass above them there's a solid block I
have<00:04:42.780> noticed<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.500> if<00:04:43.800> there<00:04:43.979> is<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.100> solid

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
have noticed that if there is a solid

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.820 
have noticed that if there is a solid
block<00:04:44.610> above<00:04:44.970> these<00:04:45.240> plants<00:04:45.780> they<00:04:46.470> do<00:04:46.530> not

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
block above these plants they do not

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.600 
block above these plants they do not
give<00:04:47.310> off<00:04:47.580> fruit<00:04:48.510> also<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.560> these<00:04:49.710> Center

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
give off fruit also when these Center

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.990 
give off fruit also when these Center
blocks<00:04:50.880> are<00:04:51.180> raised<00:04:51.479> up<00:04:51.810> like<00:04:53.810> this<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:56.190> these

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
blocks are raised up like this and these

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.680 
blocks are raised up like this and these
if<00:04:57.930> these<00:04:58.200> were<00:04:58.500> solid<00:04:58.830> blocks<00:04:59.540> you<00:05:00.540> would

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
if these were solid blocks you would

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.850 
if these were solid blocks you would
create<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.290> pitch-black<00:05:01.910> area<00:05:03.200> around<00:05:04.200> your

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
create a pitch-black area around your

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.960 
create a pitch-black area around your
crops<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:07.020> doing<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.070> would<00:05:08.310> make<00:05:08.550> them<00:05:08.760> pop

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
crops and doing that would make them pop

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.090 
crops and doing that would make them pop
out<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.330> ground<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.750> seeds<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.950> do

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
out of the ground as seeds and you do

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.460 
out of the ground as seeds and you do
not<00:05:11.250> want<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.700> you<00:05:11.940> want<00:05:12.870> them<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.140> stay<00:05:13.320> in

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
not want that you want them to stay in

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.130 
not want that you want them to stay in
there<00:05:13.620> forever

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
there forever

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.710 
there forever
okay<00:05:16.140> now<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.669> pretty<00:05:18.030> much<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> done

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
okay now this is a pretty much a done

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.170 
okay now this is a pretty much a done
farm<00:05:19.169> other<00:05:19.470> than<00:05:19.860> putting<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.580> switch<00:05:20.850> in

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
farm other than putting the switch in

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.200 
farm other than putting the switch in
the<00:05:21.390> fence<00:05:21.600> up<00:05:22.160> now<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.220> that's<00:05:23.520> done<00:05:23.760> what

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
the fence up now that that's done what

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.010 
the fence up now that that's done what
we're<00:05:24.360> gonna<00:05:24.479> do<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:25.220> go<00:05:26.220> ahead<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.729> dig<00:05:27.479> out<00:05:27.690> a

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
we're gonna do is go ahead and dig out a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.670 
we're gonna do is go ahead and dig out a
pole<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:29.070> we<00:05:29.250> can<00:05:29.600> start<00:05:30.600> wiring<00:05:31.050> our<00:05:32.060> switch

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
pole so we can start wiring our switch

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.540 
pole so we can start wiring our switch
make<00:05:34.680> sure<00:05:34.800> you<00:05:34.890> don't<00:05:34.979> get<00:05:35.190> rid<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.430> this

go ahead and take it over there now

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.420 
go ahead and take it over there now
towards<00:05:55.920> the<00:05:56.130> redstone<00:05:56.640> over<00:05:57.000> here<00:05:58.250> there<00:05:59.250> we

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
towards the redstone over here there we

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.800 
towards the redstone over here there we
go<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:01.280> we're<00:06:02.280> gonna<00:06:02.340> put<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.670> block<00:06:02.940> back<00:06:03.270> here

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
go and we're gonna put a block back here

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.770 
go and we're gonna put a block back here
put<00:06:04.200> some<00:06:04.230> redstone<00:06:04.740> on<00:06:05.220> top<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.880> run<00:06:06.600> the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
put some redstone on top and run the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.970 
put some redstone on top and run the
wire<00:06:06.960> it<00:06:07.260> this<00:06:07.410> way<00:06:07.650> as<00:06:07.860> well<00:06:08.870> this<00:06:09.870> is<00:06:10.140> just

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
wire it this way as well this is just

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.040 
wire it this way as well this is just
long<00:06:11.490> enough<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.240> you<00:06:12.330> don't<00:06:12.480> have<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.720> use<00:06:12.840> any

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
long enough so you don't have to use any

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.330 
long enough so you don't have to use any
repeaters<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.590> reach<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.280> last<00:06:14.460> Pistons<00:06:16.340> okay
