00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.049
 hello good kids we are here 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.729
 Novices warfare and advance good this 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.590
 once in an informative video about the 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.929
 possible new weapon that will come out inside 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.519
 of little and I have found it because that is a 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.919
 pretty interesting information and it's 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.840
 that surely comes along with the new 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.460
 dlc delete that you have to be at 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.830
 to fall is seen in some websites that came out 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.480
 today but they have not confirmed anything of 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.490
 maybe I 'll stop commenting 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.890
 the video already confirm it would also be 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.600
 bad luck but good has to be 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.270
 when falling this week I guess it will come out 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.660
 because it came out then and two months ago the 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.030
 earlier then it also seems to me that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.339
 I've seen that by June 25 I was 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.350
 confirmed for play 4 so they do not have 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.589
 that take a lot but good in the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.399
 game of moment is a fierce playing 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.949
 with hell pretty fast and it goes very 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.800
 to saco you will see good I passed a one 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.319
 very epic thing you will see that it came out 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.089
 very much they did again like some 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.010
 if we said because it was practically 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.859
 already dead but 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 I have put you is a capture so that 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.810
 came a youtube I ask michael 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.180
 condrey what is he going to have then 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.439
 the new dlc no and where I answer 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.960
 busti which is the nickname of a 12 gauge 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.030
 a double-barreled shotgun that yes that 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.009
 there are some in previous call of duty 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.110
 that could be something like that 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.750
 one of them is the olympia of white is 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.570
 one that I guess you'll know what is 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.420
 one of the possibilities would be because 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.300
 I say something similar to this shotgun in the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.610
 5 minute in the word tattoo there was also 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.530
 one that was a little bit tougher than 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.450
 would also go into the possibilities and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.940
 then it seems to me that the rangers of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.619
 modern warfare2 would also be one of the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.960
 possibilities that this one would give me 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.250
 that I put them in the truth because it was 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.899
 One last one I loved the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.030
 shotguns those enzymes could be put 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.159
 in dual is what happens that they did not have 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.619
 a lot of reach but I got him it's like that 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.860
 hit and is that they burst but good and 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.750
 you will see why on the game was 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.580
 that I swelled a lot of good gusts 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.950
 for system so they do not usually kill 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.259
 much I do not always or not for 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.080
 the normal spine drone 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.360
 you carry in manual still swells in this 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.300
 good map, you fancy because you wear it 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.950
 you but now comes the moment for the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.750
 At the moment of departure, he had a run of 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.000
 15 I tried to throw the warning could not 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.970
 mental be here we are already dead 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.160
 something and wine my mate is what killed him 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.400
 because I do not know if I would have had time to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.010
 kill him but he left and as I told you 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.989
 they looked again as if we said no 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.819
 I understood that it had happened and you see that 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.819
 I stayed like two seconds and freaking out 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.849
 colors no no I did not know what had happened 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.340
 but I was still alive but not good inside 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.840
 20 I did not have much left over anymore 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 that he was super safe to go with the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.280
 hell yes you move so a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.870
 little slower than with the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.480
 help or help her so it's more 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.489
 quick but I liked it a lot 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.760
 already at least two or three ago 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.110
 weeks the game if you see the prestige 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.000
 at least in two or three prestige 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.910
 less but there you see the attack drone 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.980
 I was swelling good amazing 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.440
 I really liked the game 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.040
 but good that going back to 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.770
 from before surely because we will not know 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.410
 soon, if he bears the new 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.020
 dlc the new weapon but surely it is 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.440
 the next weapon comes out when it comes out but 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.030
 it will be one of these so like no 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.830
 that the truth that yes it was necessary 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.990
 because the shotguns in this game do 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.780
 that are a bit loose 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.510
 the other day I got the dna and 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 with the s12 so I got bloated 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.860
 very much with the elite model 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.890
 even as it has enough charger Yes 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.720
 that kills a lot you can play it 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.970
 Pretty much you can not kill two or 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.010
 three even with the others is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.710
 complicated but well let's hope it's 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.230
 quite checada no and already see if we can 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.850
 well get some game there with 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.620
 shotgun because in this game is that 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.500
 it costs a lot unless they are 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.990
 maps and how combat or one of these 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060
 it's complicated besides you can kill 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.490
 but they usually get a lot of not 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.770
 long distances and that give you a jump 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.690
 right in front and you can not do anything with 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.980
 the shotgun but well I hope that you 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.870
 I liked the video if you liked it 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.530
 then leave your like and nothing 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.530
 until next time 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.910
 because the vale 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.910
 me to do mother
