00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 around 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.880

 quite casual for example Online Murder 2 and Bonn Monsters 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.950
 but what you have to do is good on your own 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 but does not 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 that too no monsters or too 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.559
 the GDL demands a memory 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.749
