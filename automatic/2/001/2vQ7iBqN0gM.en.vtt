00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi guys my anger today is 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 on dior's chip and law is one of the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.490
 last arrived at the house of gold looks like one 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.710
 enamel also because it is made but 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.500
 exactly like their enamels but it is one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 gel color for lips for cheeks away 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.619
 this color they call it pink but they are 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.410
 never a pink coral so it is not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 really pink but more a coral is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 calculated that the first time I have it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 received we also received the I 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.859
 bought the first time I tried it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.660
 because I practically bought it on 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 site always on the site always online 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500
 because there was no mussels on it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 when the happy suit came not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 had used exactly in the bed the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 description so I thought it was kind 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 those of saint laurent inten oil 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.309
 instead it is quite another thing 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 the first time I tried it I took it off 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 the cap I never understood this stuff 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 here because they do these facts here is not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.390
 the only brand that does it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.270
 explain to me from the dog why they do these 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 tap you have to remove and then later or not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.500
 I never happened what they are anyway 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.120
 there but they tried it the first time 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 that he had arrived home with mine 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 package and I remained kind of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.350
 medicine that was mine my 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.439
 first time with this product sa da 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.299
 I don't know a little herbal medicine 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.700
 but it is not that it has a little smell that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.150
 makes her mad at least for mine mine 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.430
 nose as an applicator to this ball 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 so he didn't have much 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.850
 particular as an applicator rather than 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 else because if you have thin lips 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.640
 it could be a little inconvenient for me to record 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.710
 to do it both using it on the less pro but not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 It is that it is very convenient consistency 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.140
 more than gel they are almost water and a lot 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.180
 and very liquid so every time you do 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 pull out the applicator takes it up 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.040
 so much the product and I have to stay there 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 every time to remove it 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.420
 perinetti is too short it is not really 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.460
 had to study this a little better 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.230
 applicator this method we say the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.610
 price of the product and it is only the 37 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.590
 dollars in Italy failed to 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.140
 find a site where I sell it so not 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.330
 I can tell you with certainty how much it will cost 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.890
 but more or less looking at the conversion 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.150
 what they usually do should be on 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.180
 32 euros 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:15.500
 go and put it on your cheeks first 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.410
 it looks like almost water as you can see it is 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.020
 very easy admits recent watery 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.270
 I estimate almost finished reacts based 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.459
 also to your skin so it should 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.590
 be unique and colors that are right in 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.900
 based on your complexion so me 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.340
 like because it's easy to fade you see 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.200
 that despite having put those 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.080
 crawl there does not leave the streaks 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 but it fades before drying then 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.650
 let's say it's just provole there's a 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.880
 petit and from this color which is neither 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.580
 too intense in the ma is very natural 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.520
 as a color blend it well because it lasts 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.830
 so very much worked very well 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 because it really is a crazy day 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.660
 in case what I usually do is 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.940
 then take a brush with his team e 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.030
 work the corners to make it all 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 more natural then simply where 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.989
 however, the product ends with the brush is 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 there had n't been enough with the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.880
 dye a job this way and this 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.260
 is a cheeks then effect an effect 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.850
 very very healthy fresh on the lips 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.459
 we put on dry lips without 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.320
 cocoa butter the usual face two passes 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.640
 so wait for the first pass to be 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.709
 on which we do another 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.880
 once it has dried I do the 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.110
 second pass 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.910
 I'm always careful not to take myself 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.799
 too much color because obviously it ends 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.930
 all in the mouth and this is not very good 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.519
 the second past aspect that yes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.650
 dry and then come back 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.660
 ok they are back you can see the effect 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.130
 on the lips and this effect a lot 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.830
 light you see that it is not a lipstick 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.940
 that there is no body but that he has 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.700
 a feint and it's this pretty rose a lot 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.420
 Plescia shoot you a little recently posed the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.080
 duration 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.970
 when I look at the planks it is atomic 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.390
 incredible hard it all sweat sports and 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.980
 this and that other sum puts social 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.170
 hair hat scarf that make us 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.569
 front is hidden behind the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.090
 Lasting on the lips lasts a long time 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.609
 after a while the color starts a little 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.700
 be a little more tenuous so it is not so 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.919
 intense but I see a pink I do not see though 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.630
 let's say it's hard for so many hours if 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.389
 eat in the things they have 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.310
 inside a lot of oil we and if it is 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.930
 eat and then start to fade first 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.460
 so you have to be careful about what 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.270
 eat he ate he entered mendrisio 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.190
 no problem 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.960
 because there is no hatred for how much 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.300
 regards the expiry of the date of 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.280
 opening is twelve months and inside 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.610
 there are 10 ml of product 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.070
 my vote so then this product is 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.139
 drum roll 9 beach 9 why 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.030
 honestly if you pass the mirror 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.770
 the smell coming out of me is not good e 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.560
 really a great product 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.419
 the only flaw is the applicator and perhaps the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.340
 then with a very liquid sentence 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.460
 you have to be a little careful because it tends 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.050
 a little too much product apart 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.910
 I really like that a lot 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.460
 regarding the cheek area 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.990
 on the lips and beautiful but let's say that there 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 are other products maybe more beautiful and 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.169
 especially if you like the effect of 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.840
 lipstick this is not a lipstick though 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.090
 I really like it on my cheeks 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.090
 really so much girls beauties
