00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.890
 I think it's an idea is to make a real golazo 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.800
 at least since the three suits 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 first of all 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.610
 I do not want to offend delicate asus 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.870
 the British actor spd 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.050
 we have been observing the spirit world and you have learned something that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.330
 You do not like me 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.250
 African art 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.140
 if finally your cousin and your management 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
 libranda does not give up 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 to face us everything went wrong 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640
 the Syrian forces 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.490
 the same in the schools that wants to destroy us 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.700
 2 will look next 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.259
 are strong gusts john terrible how powerful this will be if it is capable of 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.259
 play with your riad destinations 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 percent 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.990
 damn I do not know what to think of this latest vision of the crystal sheraton 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 We looked for clues about the end of the universe 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.070
 but these days these are going to go 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.930
 therefore it is urgent to look for more 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.980
 we try to discover why the supreme mind created the queen of the blades 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 that became the one that destroyed the universe not 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 there are things 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.100
 I think she is the only one who can save him 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 I 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 sa 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.779
 I told you I've been looking at the logs 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.119
 those damned protos do not continue to have much advantage 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.559
 two years ago you can not believe 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.859
 Tell me 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.389
 they have learned a few new tricks since the last time we fought 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.529
 since when can transpose to the type unless they want I thought that 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.889
 at least they needed some portal 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.909
 where you want or do not need to be if you continue or not some other source of 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.729
 Energy 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.729
 but they have been working their technology like us 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 going around he planted himself just like crazy 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.569
 home Sweet Home 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.899
 what iniesta was doing 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.049
 I'm too old for this shit 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.399
 This old ship needs a set-up 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.399
 I should go out for a walk 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.039
 I like all the little lights 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.299
 for having a bold and unstoppable plan 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.109
 the revolution comes slow shore 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.409
 it's over I'll have to start pretending that I'm working 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.499
 iniesta was doing 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.079
 in care to whom 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.319
 I think you're lost
