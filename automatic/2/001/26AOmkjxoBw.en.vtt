00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 if you are here it is because really the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.060
 your hair is in need of a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.060
 help to shine around 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 I came today to do a shower of brilliance. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.869
 and I believe it's the first time 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 I'm doing a shower of brightness and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.640
 people will see here together if it works 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.970
 I want to leave my network 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.079
 grow one more time why this time 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.630
 I want to make lights still require 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 discolour all of it and reaches all of it I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.590
 I want to make lights here at the root is already 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.390
 asking for a Portuguese one is well stained and 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 this is the fact that it has stained that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 in the root was bothering enough and there 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.829
 I decided to make a bath of brilliance for 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.719
 see if there is an improvement in the business, right? 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 so I'm going to show you the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.120
 products that I return to using 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 that shine bath is okay I hope 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.650
 that works, and I also hope that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.549
 be it right but let's go there 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 12/11 high fashion 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.409
 there will need a white mask I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.720
 I use this then seb l'oreal 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 I'm going to put a few drops of oil 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.689

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.189
 also puts an ampola 'diet mine that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 This is the one I'm going to use this one of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.340
 skaf skaf I think that's how you talk 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.670
 for a drop of the chef 10 12 to give 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.290
 one set more and the measure of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.990
 coloration is the following we will put the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540
 each spoon in the case of the bag 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.409
 spoonful here that little woman 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 From Thursday, I'm going to use two och 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.170
 soc and the same quantity that will be used 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.660
 If I'm going to use white cream and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.050
 Mixer is ready she got like this 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.690
 consistently well okay I do not know why 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.940
 but the cream has to be white and then 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 I'm going to give a researched one the best 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.960
 to know why the credit in which 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.510
 White, but I believe it 's not for 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.730
 interfere with hair color I do not know more 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.520
 I'll research and then I'll tell you 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.850
 on the good nerd blog you will not be able to 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.770
 follow the list of products and not 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.430
 You got to see right that we're going 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.560
 need and the measurements quite right as well 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.710
 specific to what I used for my 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 Hair I put there on the blog is good and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.590
 Now I'm going to wash my hair with this 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.440
 shampoo akira 3 and baby is and moisturizing 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.050
 Deep and I'm coming back to make the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.800
 application of this mixture in hair is 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.240
 I'm with amato hair well on 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800
 bady dinho 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.340
 look a little in history to give a 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.650
 dried and not get so wet right 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 and now I had to start applying I'm going 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.680
 apply first to the most random root 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.239
 with bras applying a cream of the same 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.750
 hair nothing much ruled dinho vou 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.850
 apply with this with the brush because 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.540
 is loaded in the opening is 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.540
 ready 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.750
 I came here and see what's going to happen. 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 I've heard a lot of talk to use this 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:49.120
 hydration this hydration your bath 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:53.500
 with 10-volume ox which does not 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.840
 It interferes with color but I do not know 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.519
 A light here in this exit will stay 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.590
 well then why the zee is 30 but okay 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.310
 if you do not want to change that I 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.530
 I believe it's going to be 30 or gomes 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.099
 will interfere somewhat in the color of the root 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 assurance 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.739
 so if you do not want to change anything then 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.510
 He does not want to take any 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.500
 interesting that you use 10 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.500
 volume even okay 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.110
 and after 40 minutes the mixture 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.280
 the hair I vu and comes to show 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.070
 you are right 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.440
 girls this is the end result in 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.980
 in front of the people of the final result leaves 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.250
 very light hair well solted in the session 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.410
 which has just been hydrated in the 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.530
 truth a babel know how to damage dinho 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:39.880
 and I quite liked the result left 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.630
 a hair plus the movement let's say so 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.670
 huh 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.410
 leaves the hair in a smooth motion 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:50.380
 I need a lot of enjoyment just remembering that 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:55.150
 you should if you do not want to change the color 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:58.840
 of its root is do with hoshi of ten thousand 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.600
 names but the procedure is really cool and I 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.600
 I tested and I liked it and I'll do it 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.420
