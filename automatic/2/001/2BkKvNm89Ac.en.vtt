you can deep precision world war it also

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.659 
you can deep precision world war it also
is<00:04:24.900> proof<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.889> should<00:04:26.100> actually<00:04:26.250> try

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
is proof that you should actually try

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.949 
is proof that you should actually try
