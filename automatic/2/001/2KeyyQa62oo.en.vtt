00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.910
 maybe and will make a partnership 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.880

 it's the same spirit the events happen 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.840
 to delight is a dreamer it is a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.370
 develop their leu faithfully the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.380
 director was inspired the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.720
 personality crap wanted 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.280
 leave the future what they saw that the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.660
 personality diallo city ​​develops in 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.370
 liquid and I think they were working 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.040
 on a project but a lesson I 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.600
 leave to san francisco and are in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.730
 train to develop a tunnel you do 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.290
 an hour's drive while normally 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.610
 we do more than six hours seven hours 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.320
 others just one hour in bands 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.450
 magnetic a shift to the bomb 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.100
 a short believer it's people who 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.239
 develop these he develops empires 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.400
 development but if justin gatlin 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.519
 calls the machine a minimum commitment 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.010
 event and that's two things going on 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.380
 not apart from that we know they're going out 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.040
 and watch we know they're going out 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.810
 also activated we also know that they so 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.170
 to be far from dominating 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.819
 the simple the wade objectivity and are 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 developing one savard is 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.160

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.720
 develop special sensors for 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.200
 predict the onset of a crisis 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.180

 develops very interesting things 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.880
 but I find you to be the domain of 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.799
 health so-called that 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.660
