00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello in touch maria kari and we 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.980
 today we will meet with you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 important concept of photoshop as 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 transformation let's first now 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 turn we will load the picture into our 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.890
 the program can do it several 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:22.590
 ways first press the file key 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.369
 open we find the dad we need with 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
 pictures 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 select this picture and press the button 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 open in the distance and the picture plunged 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.520
 already in the program and the second most very 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 simple way is directly 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.550
 first on computers open folder with 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.270
 pictures 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 then choose this picture and 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 physical drag and drop 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 this picture is in our working field 5 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 nasta 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.910
 nevertheless it is a picture ready to work and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.440
 let's look now right here and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 we see that this layer we have a picture 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.769
 it goes as the source file you touch it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.189
 we will not and therefore press the control buttons 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.189
 jay 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.360
 duplicate the data layer with the picture and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 bottom layer 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 source files we include work 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 only with the top to do 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 Transformation picture from the first stage 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 have seen the body that is we can stand on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 some particular layer but if we 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 work in this picture let 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 select the layer that we need here 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.290
 your with your eyes here it is off 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.960
 switched off 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.150
 stand to do the transformation 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.820
 pictures need to call data 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.670
 commands this is done with the command 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 editing free 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 transformation and when you 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 click edit free 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.189
 transforming then he prompts 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 that you can press the control hotkey 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.619
 you 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.619
 remember by clicking on the keyboard combination 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.930
 kontrol keys then we pour out free 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.270
 transforming and see what's around 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.100
 pictures appeared a certain point 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 with the help of which we can do something 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.659
 bringing to these. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.280
 the mouse we see appears such 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.489
 arrows that shows something 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.319
 can do with this picture and so 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.220
 There are several types of 20 obrabi 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.770
 this is horizontal scaling then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.569
 when you take a picture of a lateral 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.000
 . 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.000
 some kind of edge to the picture 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.610
 or vertical scaling also 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.100
 there is a rational scale when you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.560
 You take a little corner of the image, and also, and 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.200
 start driving somewhere but you 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.310
 see that your hand may not exactly 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.360
 get lucky and the picture will break 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 in order to have a clear 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.780
 proportional scaling 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.980
 pictures there are certain commands 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.050
 left-hand hold down the shift key on 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.170
 keyboard and then take the mouse by 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.180
 little corner of the picture for the bottom and start 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.239
 lead the top corner in order to 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 transforms this picture and how would you 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.780
 then the mouse did not drive up and down 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.670
 the proportions do not change that is she 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.920
 proportional does not scale 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.390
 breaks and in the same way if you 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.390
 Take this tick. 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.200
 which one is another team 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 hold down the left hand 2 keys alt 6 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 that is, you squeeze take a corner and 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.910
 start to center or drive it 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.030
 squeezed proportional quite so 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.129
 way you now know that there are 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.510
 certain ways of transforming 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.670
 pictures zoom and and reduce 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.340
 increase with this learned so 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.180
 hot keys should work with 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.920
 this picture 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.049
 in order to secure this 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.250
 the result is valid in this way 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.170
 pressing alt shift scales the image 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.959
 we want it to be smaller 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.019
 initially to keep busy 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.090
 create some specific collage 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.510
 loss of volume and fix our result 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.549
 clicking on the button 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.440
 in this lesson transformation 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.549
 using scaling and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.560
 finishing and I'm waiting for you next video 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.610
 where we will study the next technique 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.610
 processing our
