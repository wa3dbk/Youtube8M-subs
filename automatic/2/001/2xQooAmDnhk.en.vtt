if<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.599> look<00:00:00.780> at<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.079> poll<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:01.800> right<00:00:02.340> look

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
if you look at this poll here right look

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.599 
if you look at this poll here right look
you<00:00:03.049> like<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.200> contact<00:00:04.680> so<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:04.950> can<00:00:05.160> get<00:00:05.400> put

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
you like the contact so you can get put

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.220 
you like the contact so you can get put
on<00:00:05.730> there<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.089> try<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.420> slide<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.049> can

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
on there and try and slide it you can

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.440 
on there and try and slide it you can
kind<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> feel<00:00:08.370> what<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> friction<00:00:09.120> value

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
kind of feel what the friction value

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.419 
kind of feel what the friction value
would<00:00:09.540> be<00:00:09.599> like<00:00:10.010> versus<00:00:11.010> something<00:00:11.250> that's

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
would be like versus something that's

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.600 
would be like versus something that's
shiny<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.719> if<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.799> start<00:00:14.009> shining<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
shiny like if you can start shining that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.970 
shiny like if you can start shining that
up<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> creating<00:00:15.450> heat<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> can't<00:00:16.800> create

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
up and creating heat I can't create

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340 
up and creating heat I can't create
enough<00:00:17.250> heat<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.000> when<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> tire<00:00:18.960> spins

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
enough heat now but when the tire spins

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080 
enough heat now but when the tire spins
crazy<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:19.949> polishes<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.730> ends<00:00:21.029> up

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
crazy it just polishes it ends up

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.509 
crazy it just polishes it ends up
turning<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.660> ice<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
turning and ice so you can get a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.370 
turning and ice so you can get a
friction<00:00:23.970> value<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> Chloe<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.080> run<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
friction value this is Chloe we run in

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.179 
friction value this is Chloe we run in
the<00:00:25.470> boat<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> 4<00:00:25.949> 5<00:00:26.480> 4<00:00:27.480> -<00:00:27.750> maybe<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.830> take<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the boat of 4 5 4 - maybe you take it

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.810 
the boat of 4 5 4 - maybe you take it
down<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> under<00:00:29.810> 2.0<00:00:31.099> great<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.460> then

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
down to under 2.0 great so then then

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
down to under 2.0 great so then then
they<00:00:32.969> dig<00:00:33.180> themselves<00:00:33.329> into<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.870> rock<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
they dig themselves into a rock so the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.049 
they dig themselves into a rock so the
trick<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:37.200> able<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.520> get<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
trick is to be able to get them out of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.360 
trick is to be able to get them out of
the<00:00:39.149> rock<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:40.170> without<00:00:40.379> spinning<00:00:40.860> anymore

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the rock right without spinning anymore

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.680 
the rock right without spinning anymore
get<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.329> bit<00:00:42.420> higher

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
get them on to a little bit higher

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.920 
get them on to a little bit higher
friction<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:45.510> almost<00:00:45.780> double

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
friction so you can get almost double

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.779 
friction so you can get almost double
the<00:00:46.289> friction<00:00:46.680> value<00:00:46.800> by<00:00:47.190> getting<00:00:47.550> them<00:00:47.670> out

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the friction value by getting them out

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.630 
the friction value by getting them out
of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> rut<00:00:48.180> under<00:00:48.989> some<00:00:49.170> snow<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of the rut under some snow and the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.049 
of the rut under some snow and the
beauty<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> type<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> strap<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
beauty about this type of strap is that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
beauty about this type of strap is that
it<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:55.050> harness<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.680> some<00:00:55.920> tension<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it will harness up some tension so that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
it will harness up some tension so that
you<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:58.050> almost<00:00:59.010> bungee<00:00:59.760> cord<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.390> use

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you actually almost bungee cord or use

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.080 
you actually almost bungee cord or use
the<00:01:00.899> elasticity<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> energy<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.820> fill

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the elasticity or the energy that fill

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
the elasticity or the energy that fill
filled<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> cord<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.979> thing

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
filled up in the cord to get that thing

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
filled up in the cord to get that thing
out<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> rut<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> first<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.979> got

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
out of the rut so first of all you got

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.890 
out of the rut so first of all you got
no<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:08.820> control<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.510> person

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
no you have no control of the person

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
no you have no control of the person
necessarily<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> vehicle<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.220> simply<00:01:11.640> ask

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
necessarily in the vehicle so simply ask

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.910 
necessarily in the vehicle so simply ask
them<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> jump<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.799> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
them that will get you to jump in this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.870 
them that will get you to jump in this
vehicle<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.549> good<00:01:14.880> ask<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.330> look<00:01:16.850> put<00:01:17.850> your

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
vehicle so good ask them look put your

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.580 
vehicle so good ask them look put your
vehicle<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.540> neutral

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
vehicle in neutral

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.469 
vehicle in neutral
let's<00:01:20.920> straighten<00:01:21.220> out<00:01:21.430> your<00:01:21.460> tires<00:01:21.880> right<00:01:22.270> so

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
let's straighten out your tires right so

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.700 
let's straighten out your tires right so
we<00:01:22.630> break<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.290> least<00:01:23.500> amount<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.890> resistance

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
we break the least amount of resistance

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.300 
we break the least amount of resistance
don't<00:01:26.710> put<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.950> vehicle<00:01:27.100> in<00:01:27.400> neutral

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.880 

okay<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.030> what<00:01:31.900> I'm<00:01:32.049> getting<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
okay so what I'm getting this is the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.710 
okay so what I'm getting this is the
instructions<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.580> we<00:01:33.820> would<00:01:33.970> give<00:01:34.180> what<00:01:34.600> I'm

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
instructions that we would give what I'm

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.070 
instructions that we would give what I'm
going<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:34.990> do<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:36.250> I'm<00:01:36.460> going<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:37.720> up<00:01:37.900> some

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
going to do is I'm going to take up some

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.140 
going to do is I'm going to take up some
tension<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:39.369> I'm<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.700> take<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> little

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
tension then I'm going to take a little

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.730 
tension then I'm going to take a little
bit<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.360> run<00:01:40.600> you're<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.020> feel<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.290> jerk

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
bit of run you're going to feel a jerk

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.310 
bit of run you're going to feel a jerk
your<00:01:42.610> vehicle<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.270> move<00:01:43.450> forward

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
your vehicle is going to move forward

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.740 
your vehicle is going to move forward
don't<00:01:44.830> let<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.190> roll<00:01:45.369> back<00:01:45.670> once<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.570> goes

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
don't let it roll back once it goes

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.609 
don't let it roll back once it goes
forward<00:01:47.290> step<00:01:47.560> on<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.830> brake<00:01:48.040> okay<00:01:48.399> not<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
forward step on the brake okay not it so

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.050 
forward step on the brake okay not it so
then<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.520> jump<00:01:51.700> in<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.850> truck<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
then one of you can jump in the truck so
