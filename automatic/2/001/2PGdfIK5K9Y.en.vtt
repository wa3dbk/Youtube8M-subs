thing about drum rack is actually these

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.940 
thing about drum rack is actually these
different<00:02:16.459> options<00:02:16.610> over<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.770> as<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
see you have your chain list and you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260 
see you have your chain list and you
have<00:02:20.750> your<00:02:21.260> devices<00:02:21.920> some<00:02:22.700> will<00:02:22.819> go<00:02:22.910> ahead<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
turn on the chain list and the devices

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.350 
turn on the chain list and the devices
so<00:02:27.920> when<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.250> your<00:02:28.340> devices<00:02:28.880> open<00:02:29.209> which

so when you have your devices open which
is<00:02:29.480> actually<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.959> section<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.620> the

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
is actually this section here on the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.620 
is actually this section here on the
right<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:31.880> where<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.270> actually

right this is where you can actually

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.750 
right this is where you can actually
affect<00:02:33.020> each<00:02:33.260> sound<00:02:33.680> individually<00:02:34.040> depending

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
affect each sound individually depending

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.360 
affect each sound individually depending
on<00:02:34.880> which<00:02:35.000> one<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.239> have<00:02:35.330> selected<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> for

on which one you have selected so for
instance<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.880> have<00:02:38.150> whatever<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.959> zone<00:02:39.170> is

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
instance I have whatever this zone is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.370 
instance I have whatever this zone is
the<00:02:39.950> shaker<00:02:40.220> Iblees<00:02:41.319> selected<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:44.380> over

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the shaker Iblees selected it and over

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.170 
the shaker Iblees selected it and over
here<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:45.830> make<00:02:45.950> any<00:02:46.220> type<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.519> changes<00:02:47.000> to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
here I can make any type of changes to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.780 
here I can make any type of changes to
just<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.630> sound<00:02:47.930> alone<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.190> want<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
just that sound alone that I want to so

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.729 
just that sound alone that I want to so
I<00:02:49.819> can<00:02:50.209> um<00:02:51.069> change<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.250> start<00:02:52.519> point<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.970> it

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.430 

make<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.769> loop<00:02:58.130> turn<00:02:58.700> on<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:58.940> filter<00:02:59.440> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
make it loop turn on the filter the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:14.080 
make it loop turn on the filter the
spread<00:03:01.690> transpose<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:13.549> different<00:03:13.910> things

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
spread transpose it so different things

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.030 
spread transpose it so different things
like<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:15.380> really<00:03:15.470> cool<00:03:15.799> because<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
like that that's really cool because you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.650 
like that that's really cool because you
can<00:03:16.250> come<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.519> with<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:16.670> lot<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.060> different

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
can come up with a lot of different

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.780 
can come up with a lot of different
creativity<00:03:18.260> for<00:03:18.410> your<00:03:18.500> sounds<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.610> same

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
creativity for your sounds have the same

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.199 
creativity for your sounds have the same
sound<00:03:20.030> doing<00:03:20.329> all<00:03:20.420> kinds<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.690> crazy<00:03:20.810> things

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
sound doing all kinds of crazy things

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.610 
sound doing all kinds of crazy things
also<00:03:23.209> over<00:03:23.450> here<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.750> chain<00:03:23.989> list<00:03:24.260> is<00:03:24.440> where

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
also over here the chain list is where

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.759 
also over here the chain list is where
you<00:03:24.709> can<00:03:24.859> start<00:03:25.239> playing<00:03:26.239> around<00:03:26.359> with<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
you can start playing around with the

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.180 
you can start playing around with the
volume<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.269> panning<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.870> those<00:03:30.829> sounds

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
volume and the panning of those sounds

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.729 
volume and the panning of those sounds
individually<00:03:31.900> but<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.079> thing<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.320> love<00:03:33.560> is

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
individually but one thing I love is

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.440 
individually but one thing I love is
that<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.040> actually<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.790> as<00:03:34.940> well<00:03:34.970> up

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
that you actually can do that as well up

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.020 
that you actually can do that as well up
here<00:03:35.900> at<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> top<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.430> see<00:03:37.609> when<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.850> have

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
here at the top so you see when we have

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400 
here at the top so you see when we have
the<00:03:38.180> drum<00:03:38.390> rack<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.690> actually<00:03:39.019> this<00:03:39.200> new

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
the drum rack you actually this new

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.069 
the drum rack you actually this new
little<00:03:39.650> triangle<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.120> when<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.450> open<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.930> up

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
little triangle and when you open it up

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.449 
little triangle and when you open it up
it<00:03:42.260> will<00:03:42.350> actually<00:03:42.470> show<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.829> all<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.340> your

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it will actually show you all of your

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.449 
it will actually show you all of your
different<00:03:43.790> sounds<00:03:44.090> laid<00:03:44.299> out<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:46.130> they're<00:03:46.280> all

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
different sounds laid out so they're all

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:57.130 
different sounds laid out so they're all
separated<00:03:55.480> that's<00:03:56.480> pretty<00:03:56.750> cool<00:03:56.930> when<00:03:57.049> it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
separated that's pretty cool when it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.800 
separated that's pretty cool when it
comes<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.650> mixing<00:03:57.950> also<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.209> have<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.540> choke

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
comes to mixing also you have the choke

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.099 
comes to mixing also you have the choke
option<00:04:00.320> that's<00:04:00.920> good<00:04:01.160> for<00:04:01.340> high<00:04:01.489> hats

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
option that's good for high hats

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.559 
option that's good for high hats
basically<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.260> can<00:04:03.410> tell<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:04.120> certain<00:04:05.120> note

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
basically you can tell a certain note

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.979 
basically you can tell a certain note
MIDI<00:04:06.290> note<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.680> Mike<00:04:06.829> C<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:07.540> telling<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.690> when

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
MIDI note so Mike C and telling it when

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.530 
MIDI note so Mike C and telling it when
there's<00:04:09.920> no<00:04:10.069> distributing<00:04:10.790> choke<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.359> other

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
there's no distributing choke the other

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.240 
there's no distributing choke the other
one<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.560> when<00:04:12.709> you're<00:04:12.799> doing<00:04:12.890> things<00:04:13.160> like

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
one so when you're doing things like

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.340 
one so when you're doing things like
open<00:04:13.670> hi-hat<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.329> have<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.600> so<00:04:14.720> when<00:04:15.260> you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
open hi-hat you can have it so when you

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.729 
open hi-hat you can have it so when you
hit<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.709> Hyatt<00:04:15.919> again

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
hit the Hyatt again

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.390 
hit the Hyatt again
automatically<00:04:17.430> closes<00:04:18.919> so<00:04:19.919> let<00:04:20.039> me<00:04:20.099> just<00:04:20.220> pull

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
automatically closes so let me just pull

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.920 
automatically closes so let me just pull
up<00:04:20.519> another<00:04:20.639> file<00:04:21.030> real<00:04:21.239> quick<00:04:21.419> just<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.690> show

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
up another file real quick just to show

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.180 
up another file real quick just to show
you<00:04:21.989> how<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.289> looks<00:04:22.319> when<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.800> kind<00:04:22.949> of<00:04:23.039> mess

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you how it looks when you kind of mess
