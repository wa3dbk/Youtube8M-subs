00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.490
 now we install a wardrobe two 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:29.340
 mirrored doors 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 bronze profile design project fastened

 basic level 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.559
 so here we have this butt 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:57.350
 set 6 shelves and put them on 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:03.469

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.180
 and on the floor, too, without a gap 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.040
 established two crossbars in the second 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 compartment 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.310
 1 and 2 prepared the door already panels on the right 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 and left 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 here so stand all with my stick department 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.500
 we have prepared such a spacer 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 twisted out of scraps and pressed 2 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.810
 bezel now we have dealt him a foam 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.680
 mounting and insert the view in 1 body dropped 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:56.310
 they clamp the mouth on the panel, we figured 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.310
 foam and now my stick 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.149
 stuck right on mounting first straight 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.149
 to both 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:36.489
 inflicted white in the second bezel and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:57.549
 Now we, too, will stick our place 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:59.799
 you there beer is not a tower for mounting 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.540
 upper rails we use these here 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.959
 corners 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.959
 spotted with horror like this which poses 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:17.220
 exact grooves and in this groove we insert 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:26.829
 one shelf 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:31.209
 one corner shelf here from this side 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:35.940
 you can combine it right through this one 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.389
 here we are already fastening through the hole 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.579
 stuffing porn 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.459
 the upper rails put here such 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:46.299
 aluminum corners that we cut 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.419
 out of this fat we are drilling now 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.959
 here is a hole and fasten it under 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:57.400
 stretch ceiling for drilled for 2 answers 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:01.810
 now completely minced by secured 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.600
 top rail under the stretch ceiling mind 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.100
 false-panel 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.210
 under the bottom rail we need to put 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.720
 wedges 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.190
 10 guys and on the bottom rail mount two 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.200
 wedges here such 10 millimeters 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:22.180
 because the floor is uneven we need it 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:26.230
 align here he goes to zero here 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.650
 Forward thickness is 10 millimeter like this 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.470
 with a wedge we leveled it with wedges 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.560
 not visible on the door 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.920
 here there is a 10 millimeter climate and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.550
 set mirroring 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:49.590
 they have committed here such that the foam spacers 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.590
 we have easter eggs here exactly
