00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.680
 to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.960
 and how about youtube friends are 126 with 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.510
 another video this is a very short video is 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.400
 about the new update of clash of 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.130
 clans like this is about a 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.320
 week announces a new update 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.450
 we expected it to be with more 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.789
 more time however he was 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.980
 available today so you know 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.190
 update and briefly open what 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.840
 which is the first thing is that when 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.000
 we caught troops now we can write 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 the troop that we need that seems to me 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.010
 something very good so there are no mistakes 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.489
 the next thing is that to the spells of 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 radio spells and healing them 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.850
 have increased one more level just like 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.409
 to the warehouse of dark elixir they have 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.350
 increased life so it's not going to be 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.660
 so easy to steal them with lightning spell 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.940
 obviously for this 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.400
 put one more level also to the factory 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.560
 of spells then when you enter a level 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.390
 more to the spell factory also 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.050
 we will be able to see that there is already a new 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 spell the new guy is from ice 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.530
 It will be that the troop freeze 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 of the enemy clan or you can freeze 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.680
 some some building also with the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.830
 new update we can see that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.960
 we have 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.700
 another level more in the camp 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.290
 and obviously we will be able to have more 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.570
 troop this seems good to me because 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.940
 lately many do not give us time to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.310
 to finish attacking if we want 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.610
 raze some village also with the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 new update we see that you have been 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.060
 put one more level to the canyons like that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.610
 Spanish at level 12 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.290
 it seems very good to me among more troop 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.060
 we have obviously we are going to need 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.640
 more defenses so he has committed a 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 level more to the guns just like 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.350
 as we can see there at the bottom of the photo 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.289
 also and have put a level more to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.170
 wall the truth looks very good apart from 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.060
 that and it's going to be harder obviously 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.480
 we are going to have more troops to attack like this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.700
 we need to defend ourselves with 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.340
 this new update also the most 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 expected that many wanted one more level 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.160
 to the pk this is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.900
 pk level 4 alone is 13 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.849
 strong to level 4 should be even more 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.210
 so then that is what many 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.070
 they were waiting for the pec to one more level 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.940
 also in this update for me 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.970
 another important point was that tomorrow they have 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.760
 added a new crossbow or good one 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.550
 crossbow more to the town hall level 10 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.370
 that's right now it will have three crossbows 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.230
 and a hell tower more so 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.920
 now there will be three crossbows and two towers 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.010
 of hell plus another another balloon or 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.530
 black and another pump and another balloon 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.080
 orange balloon for me it seems good 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.670
 because in the previous update the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.550
 town hall at level 10 I thought that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.580
 did not have did not give much motivation in 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.990
 upload it now now it will be better and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.520
 obviously because we are going to have more 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.220
 troops to attack we need more 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.980
 defense also another point that I saw that I 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.840
 it seemed very good is that the castle of 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.120
 clan can now be accelerated the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.590
 request of the troop I imagine that it is going to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.239
 be with gems obviously 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.980
 and that seems very good to me because there 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.870
 times you needed it and you had to 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.430
 wait fifteen or twenty minutes 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.560
 it took 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.719
 well, it was just that, gentlemen, I hope 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.700
 you liked the video I hope they 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.129
 serve and you know if you want to continue 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.930
 watching videos from my channel subscribe 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:53.359

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.359
 and see you in a next video bay
