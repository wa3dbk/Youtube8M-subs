00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
 new leesplay by sims 4 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 you just look at it 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 great design just class 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.940
 I really like it but first I want 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.710
 see the famous gallery sims 4 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 then there are three tabs home 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 community page and my library 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 the most important thing is the community of course 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 because here we can scream 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.779
 plot series 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 yes, but this is kind of all that while we can 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 do here till maybe soon we will 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 here already download some clothes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 something else and still here we can swing rooms 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.870
 money is like this and my library is here 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 all characters you create will be 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 kept up but in general there is still laying 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 noticeboard and menu here 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.989
 I do not know I will not you there is nothing 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.180
 but only that training is shown here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.990
 how to do that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.330
 if you are interested and if you do not have a game 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.610
 you wonder what you are here to me 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 write i can take a picture of myself 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.549
 in the group throw off all these photos you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
 can read 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.030
 given if you want in general that is all 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.650
 so so that we can proceed to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.650
 creating our family 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.590
 and so these are my characters 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.320
 have turned out 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:17.790
 the first character is katherine house she 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.460

 I really like these leggings this 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.410
 In general, tights can be considered but to me 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.290

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.770

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.340
 cuddle with other characters with 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.170
 character trait in the board recruited 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.880
 confidence next to them and come

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.320
 parties in general we have such characters 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.390
 It turned out that we start playing 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.640
 finally 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.680

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:42.090

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:45.090

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.880
 a character needs to live with us somewhere 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.730

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.650

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.320
