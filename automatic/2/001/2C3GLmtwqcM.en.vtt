00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
pitch factor walking but folks I have

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.250 
pitch factor walking but folks I have
decided<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> build<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> new<00:00:14.370> studio<00:00:14.790> board

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
