how<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> make<00:00:02.790> one<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.149> fastest<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.780> paper

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
how to make one of the fastest a paper

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.240 
how to make one of the fastest a paper
airplanes<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.190> world<00:00:07.010> extremely<00:00:08.010> fast

airplanes in the world extremely fast

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.009 
airplanes in the world extremely fast
but<00:00:08.460> it's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> little<00:00:09.150> tricky<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.450> make<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.900> you

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
but it's a little tricky to make so you

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
but it's a little tricky to make so you
just<00:00:10.110> got<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> follow<00:00:10.559> along<00:00:10.889> okay

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
just got to follow along okay

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.709 
just got to follow along okay
first<00:00:12.660> you're<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.230> take<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.969> top<00:00:14.969> see

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
first you're going to take your top see

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.240 
first you're going to take your top see
the<00:00:15.780> top<00:00:15.990> corners<00:00:16.379> right<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.010> you're<00:00:17.160> going

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the top corners right here you're going

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
the top corners right here you're going
to<00:00:17.400> fold<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:18.300> down<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:19.500> other

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
to fold them down just like in my other

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.429 
to fold them down just like in my other
tutorials<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.670> know<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:22.140> fold

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
tutorials you know like that so you fold

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.609 
tutorials you know like that so you fold
this<00:00:23.100> down<00:00:25.070> here<00:00:26.090> I'm<00:00:27.090> doing<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.900> safe<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
this down here I'm doing it safe and

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
this down here I'm doing it safe and
your<00:00:29.160> perspective<00:00:30.349> not<00:00:31.349> mine<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> could

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
your perspective not mine so you could

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.000 
your perspective not mine so you could
see<00:00:33.690> much<00:00:33.870> clearly<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> should<00:00:34.860> look

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
see much clearly what it should look

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
see much clearly what it should look
like<00:00:37.010> there<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.129> go<00:00:41.809> open<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
like there we go open and do it with the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
like there we go open and do it with the
other<00:00:44.430> top<00:00:45.270> side<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> doesn't<00:00:53.399> form<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
other top side and if it doesn't form a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770 
other top side and if it doesn't form a
good<00:00:53.969> point<00:00:55.039> just<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.430> try<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> fold<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
good point just we try to fold to get a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
good point just we try to fold to get a
nice<00:00:58.559> sharp<00:00:58.829> point<00:01:02.660> read<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.019> your

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
nice sharp point read it with your

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.580 
nice sharp point read it with your
fingernail<00:01:04.589> picks<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> crease<00:01:05.689> okay<00:01:06.720> now

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
fingernail picks out the crease okay now

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
fingernail picks out the crease okay now
you<00:01:07.650> should<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> nice<00:01:08.369> X<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.090> your

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you should just have a nice X in your

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.679 
you should just have a nice X in your
paper<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.590> take

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
paper you want to do now is you take

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.160 
paper you want to do now is you take
this<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:18.990> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this so you take this right here this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.770 
this so you take this right here this
side<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> take<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
side so you take your right side you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.039 
side so you take your right side you
take<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.710> fold<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.580> along<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> X<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.369> X<00:01:30.049> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
take it fold it along the X the X that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
take it fold it along the X the X that
you<00:01:31.200> made<00:01:31.380> before<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> fold<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.479> like

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you made before so when you fold it like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
you made before so when you fold it like
this<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.500> should<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.860> crease<00:01:35.130> running<00:01:35.280> down

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this it should be crease running down

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.230 
this it should be crease running down
here<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.780> tool<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> crease<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
here so this tool on to that crease so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.410 
here so this tool on to that crease so
it<00:01:39.299> forms<00:01:45.619> something<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.130> looks<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.909> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it forms something that looks like this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.050 
it forms something that looks like this
so<00:01:50.750> yeah<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.259> forms<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so yeah so it forms like that now do the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
so yeah so it forms like that now do the
same<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.750> other<00:01:54.960> side<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.430> you're

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
same with the other side but now you're

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
same with the other side but now you're
going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:58.399> okay

we're<00:02:05.600> going<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:07.240> we<00:02:08.240> don't<00:02:08.619> eat<00:02:09.619> if

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
we're going to have we don't eat if

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.800 
we're going to have we don't eat if
you're<00:02:10.039> wondering<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:10.820> case<00:02:10.850> there<00:02:11.780> should

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
you're wondering in case there should

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.620 
you're wondering in case there should
not<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:13.040> point<00:02:13.670> right<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> top<00:02:15.520> so

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
not be a point right here on the top so

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.590 
not be a point right here on the top so
to<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.430> she<00:02:19.430> need<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> do<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.480> need

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
to have that she need to do is you need

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.640 
to have that she need to do is you need
to<00:02:20.709> fold<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.220> half<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.810> right<00:02:24.440> side<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:26.650> to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
to fold this in half so right side on to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.680 
to fold this in half so right side on to
the<00:02:27.680> left<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.030> your<00:02:29.420> perspective<00:02:30.370> still<00:02:33.459> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the left and your perspective still and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.940 
the left and your perspective still and
open<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.900> now<00:02:36.620> there<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:38.510> trees<00:02:39.290> here<00:02:39.620> from

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
open up now there this trees here from

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.370 
open up now there this trees here from
the<00:02:40.190> overlap<00:02:40.910> pole<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.510> just<00:02:41.720> did<00:02:41.989> that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the overlap pole that we just did that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.210 
the overlap pole that we just did that
has<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.980> unfolded<00:02:43.700> okay<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.230> now<00:02:45.350> what<00:02:46.070> you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
has to be unfolded okay so now what you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.370 
has to be unfolded okay so now what you
need<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.400> do<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> need<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> fold<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.570> top

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
need to do is you need to fold this top

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.650 
need to do is you need to fold this top
all<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> way<00:02:49.340> down<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.120> bottom<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.540> this

here just like this okay shift your

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.560 
here just like this okay shift your
paper<00:03:03.650> should<00:03:04.310> look<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:05.000> now<00:03:05.320> okay<00:03:07.570> now

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
paper should look like this now okay now

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.970 
paper should look like this now okay now
you<00:03:09.380> need<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.680> do<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.750> need<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.930> take<00:03:12.290> your

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you need to do is you need to take your

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.039 
you need to do is you need to take your
upper<00:03:14.049> right<00:03:15.049> hand<00:03:15.100> corner<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.489> they<00:03:16.760> need<00:03:17.049> to

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
upper right hand corner and they need to

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.009 
upper right hand corner and they need to
fold<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.769> in<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:21.080> that<00:03:21.350> crease<00:03:21.709> line<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.840> it

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
fold it in to that crease line that it

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.009 
fold it in to that crease line that it
should<00:03:24.350> go<00:03:24.380> past<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.160> paper<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.519> little<00:03:25.730> bit<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
should go past the paper a little bit it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.729 
should go past the paper a little bit it
looks<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:29.500> okay

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
looks like that okay

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.350 
looks like that okay
do<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.160> same<00:03:31.370> with<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.730> other<00:03:31.940> side<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:34.360> you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
do the same with the other side and you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.949 
do the same with the other side and you
fold<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.739> hits<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.640> X<00:03:38.269> right

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
fold it in so that it hits this X right

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.780 
fold it in so that it hits this X right
here<00:03:38.989> there's<00:03:39.380> an<00:03:39.470> X<00:03:39.680> right<00:03:40.160> near<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.400> talking

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
here there's an X right near to talking

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.550 
here there's an X right near to talking
to<00:03:40.850> see<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.209> crease<00:03:41.510> line<00:03:41.720> we're<00:03:42.380> going<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
to see to crease line we're going to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.800 
to see to crease line we're going to
fold<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.280> point<00:03:43.519> in<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.760> center<00:03:44.120> if

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
fold it to that point in the center if

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.360 
fold it to that point in the center if
you<00:03:45.110> didn't<00:03:45.650> understand<00:03:46.070> me<00:03:46.220> earlier<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.600> now

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
you didn't understand me earlier so now

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.729 
you didn't understand me earlier so now
she'll<00:03:52.370> look<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:52.989> now<00:03:53.989> can<00:03:54.380> unfold

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
she'll look like this now can unfold

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.810 
she'll look like this now can unfold
those<00:03:54.980> flaps<00:03:55.329> see<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:56.450> back<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.920> your

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
those flaps see you back to your

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.240 
those flaps see you back to your
previous<00:03:59.090> step<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:00.230> what<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.829> need<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.100> do

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
previous step and what you need to do

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.449 
previous step and what you need to do
now<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:03.230> need<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.620> fold<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:06.910> fold<00:04:07.910> up

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
now is you need to fold is this fold up

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.369 
now is you need to fold is this fold up
there's<00:04:10.459> no<00:04:10.760> specific<00:04:11.180> crease<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.200> you're

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
there's no specific crease that you're

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.420 
there's no specific crease that you're
supposed<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.770> fold<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.129> up<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> what<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.319> do

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
supposed to fold it up to so what I do

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.150 
supposed to fold it up to so what I do
as<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:16.970> fold<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.479> just<00:04:18.470> stop<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:18.919> make<00:04:19.130> a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
as I fold it just stop we make a

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.610 
as I fold it just stop we make a
prediction<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.570> should<00:04:20.840> be<00:04:20.870> about<00:04:21.199> an<00:04:21.410> inch

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
prediction so it should be about an inch

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.090 
prediction so it should be about an inch
this<00:04:22.340> part<00:04:23.150> right<00:04:23.750> here<00:04:23.810> there<00:04:24.290> should<00:04:24.470> be<00:04:24.620> it

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
this part right here there should be it

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.620 
this part right here there should be it
should<00:04:25.130> from<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.660> here<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.169> be<00:04:27.440> done<00:04:27.620> inch

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
should from here to here to be done inch

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.600 
should from here to here to be done inch
so<00:04:29.630> once<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.620> have<00:04:30.740> done<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.550> a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
so once you have done that you have a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.999 
so once you have done that you have a
little<00:04:31.970> triangle<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.020> has<00:04:33.169> formed<00:04:33.620> but<00:04:33.860> it's

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
little triangle that has formed but it's

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.749 
little triangle that has formed but it's
still<00:04:34.310> it's<00:04:34.990> not<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.020> triangle<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.919> folded

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
still it's not a triangle that folded

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.999 
still it's not a triangle that folded
down<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.270> just<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.720> regular<00:04:39.710> piece<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.889> paper

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
down it's just a regular piece of paper

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.060 
down it's just a regular piece of paper
intersected<00:04:40.850> by<00:04:40.880> some<00:04:41.560> lines<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.889> paper

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
intersected by some lines in the paper

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.090 
intersected by some lines in the paper
so<00:04:43.820> now<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.120> should<00:04:44.180> end<00:04:44.449> up<00:04:44.539> like<00:04:44.750> this<00:04:45.100> now

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
so now you should end up like this now

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.930 
so now you should end up like this now
what<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.400> do<00:04:46.550> if<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.419> take<00:04:47.660> this<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:49.610> you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
what you do if you take this and you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.060 
what you do if you take this and you
fold<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.449> into<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.900> crease<00:04:51.260> line<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.770> runs

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
fold it into this crease line that runs

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.510 
fold it into this crease line that runs
from<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.180> from<00:04:53.930> here<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.100> want<00:04:55.340> to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
from here and from here and you want to

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.100 
from here and from here and you want to
take<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:58.310> fold<00:04:58.789> it<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.539> that<00:04:59.750> crease<00:04:59.960> line

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
take it and fold it to that crease line

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.260 
take it and fold it to that crease line
leave<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.830> little<00:05:01.039> bit<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.250> space<00:05:01.610> because<00:05:01.850> on

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
leave a little bit of space because on

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.040 
leave a little bit of space because on
the<00:05:02.449> next<00:05:02.840> step<00:05:03.460> we're<00:05:04.460> going<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:05.120> flip<00:05:05.900> it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
the next step we're going to flip it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.730 
the next step we're going to flip it
over<00:05:06.610> flip<00:05:07.610> that<00:05:07.880> fold<00:05:08.150> over<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:09.380> do<00:05:09.590> the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
over flip that fold over so you do the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:19.689 
over flip that fold over so you do the
same<00:05:10.010> except<00:05:11.289> it's<00:05:12.289> same<00:05:12.590> both<00:05:12.949> sides<00:05:18.699> better

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
same except it's same both sides better

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.719 
same except it's same both sides better
creasing<00:05:20.270> makes<00:05:20.530> better<00:05:21.530> makes<00:05:22.370> it<00:05:22.550> better

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
creasing makes better makes it better

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.719 
creasing makes better makes it better
flight<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:23.960> do<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.229> now<00:05:24.560> you<00:05:24.590> as<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.669> said

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
flight so you do that now you as I said

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:35.409 
flight so you do that now you as I said
before<00:05:26.030> flip<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.110> over<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:31.479> crease<00:05:32.479> hard<00:05:34.419> and

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
before flip it over and crease hard and

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.040 
before flip it over and crease hard and
you<00:05:36.139> have<00:05:36.349> something<00:05:37.099> that<00:05:37.520> looks<00:05:37.789> just<00:05:38.690> like

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
you have something that looks just like

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.350 
you have something that looks just like
this<00:05:40.090> now<00:05:41.320> you<00:05:42.320> fold<00:05:42.650> this<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:43.820> top<00:05:44.120> portion

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
this now you fold this this top portion

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.450 
this now you fold this this top portion
you<00:05:44.870> fold<00:05:45.139> it<00:05:45.260> all<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.440> way<00:05:45.530> down<00:05:45.800> until<00:05:48.460> yeah

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
you fold it all the way down until yeah

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.640 
you fold it all the way down until yeah
it<00:05:49.669> don't<00:05:49.849> it<00:05:50.570> won't<00:05:50.900> allow<00:05:51.199> you<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.409> fold

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
it don't it won't allow you to fold

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.149 
it don't it won't allow you to fold
anymore<00:05:52.630> so<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:53.930> fold<00:05:54.139> it<00:05:54.260> down<00:05:54.409> to<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.740> limit

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.730 

increase<00:05:58.159> hard<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:59.030> then<00:05:59.900> you've<00:06:00.229> had<00:06:00.530> to

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
increase hard and then you've had to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.640 
increase hard and then you've had to
flip<00:06:00.949> over<00:06:01.389> what<00:06:02.389> you<00:06:02.570> do<00:06:02.720> is<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:03.050> fold<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:03.530> in

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
flip over what you do is you fold it in

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.029 
flip over what you do is you fold it in
half<00:06:03.680> now<00:06:04.159> and<00:06:04.570> as<00:06:05.570> you<00:06:06.470> could<00:06:06.590> probably<00:06:06.740> tell

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
half now and as you could probably tell

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.430 
half now and as you could probably tell
if<00:06:07.310> you<00:06:07.400> made<00:06:07.580> me<00:06:07.760> enter<00:06:07.820> paper<00:06:08.150> planes<00:06:08.479> you're

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
if you made me enter paper planes you're

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.070 
if you made me enter paper planes you're
almost<00:06:09.620> done<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:13.270> make<00:06:14.270> sure<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.659> wings<00:06:14.840> are

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
almost done so make sure the wings are

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.360 
almost done so make sure the wings are
perfectly<00:06:15.560> lined<00:06:15.830> up<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:17.169> I<00:06:18.169> need<00:06:19.039> to<00:06:19.130> make<00:06:19.250> an

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
perfectly lined up and I need to make an

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.540 
perfectly lined up and I need to make an
adjustment<00:06:20.199> you<00:06:21.199> want<00:06:21.490> now<00:06:22.490> fold<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.240> wings

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
adjustment you want now fold the wings

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.790 
adjustment you want now fold the wings
so<00:06:25.150> let<00:06:25.270> me<00:06:25.389> do<00:06:25.509> it<00:06:25.660> here<00:06:25.930> in<00:06:26.199> perspective

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
so let me do it here in perspective

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.089 
so let me do it here in perspective
sorry<00:06:27.550> I'm<00:06:28.410> going<00:06:29.410> to<00:06:29.470> fold<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:29.800> wings<00:06:30.690> just

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
sorry I'm going to fold the wings just

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.550 
sorry I'm going to fold the wings just
so<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:33.250> thought<00:06:34.060> so<00:06:34.599> that<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:34.870> edge<00:06:35.050> sits<00:06:35.440> on

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
so the thought so that the edge sits on

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.629 
so the thought so that the edge sits on
the<00:06:35.650> bottom<00:06:35.949> corner<00:06:37.139> so<00:06:39.060> right<00:06:40.060> about<00:06:40.449> here

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
the bottom corner so right about here

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.550 
the bottom corner so right about here
there<00:06:42.639> we<00:06:42.759> go

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
there we go

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:54.089 
there we go
so<00:06:44.560> it<00:06:44.620> looks<00:06:44.830> like<00:06:44.949> that<00:06:45.250> flip<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:45.970> over<00:06:53.009> and<00:06:54.009> a

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
so it looks like that flip it over and a

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.730 
so it looks like that flip it over and a
precip<00:06:54.550> sorry<00:06:55.289> sometimes<00:06:56.289> it<00:06:56.470> works<00:06:56.650> better

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
precip sorry sometimes it works better

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.600 
precip sorry sometimes it works better
if<00:06:57.069> you<00:06:57.159> crease<00:06:57.430> in<00:06:57.610> here<00:06:58.199> okay<00:06:59.490> unfold<00:07:00.490> your

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
if you crease in here okay unfold your

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.010 
if you crease in here okay unfold your
wings<00:07:00.990> and<00:07:02.580> that<00:07:03.580> is<00:07:03.849> your<00:07:04.270> world's<00:07:04.690> fastest

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
wings and that is your world's fastest

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.219 
wings and that is your world's fastest
paper<00:07:05.199> plane<00:07:05.470> now<00:07:05.979> if<00:07:06.280> your<00:07:06.759> plane<00:07:07.150> keeps<00:07:07.930> it

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:08.229 
paper plane now if your plane keeps it

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.279 
paper plane now if your plane keeps it
moving<00:07:08.889> like<00:07:09.159> flies<00:07:09.460> upside<00:07:09.819> down<00:07:10.240> and<00:07:10.509> it

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
moving like flies upside down and it

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:15.719 
moving like flies upside down and it
flips<00:07:11.680> over<00:07:11.889> and<00:07:12.240> just<00:07:13.240> does<00:07:14.580> just<00:07:15.580> does

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:15.729 
flips over and just does just does

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.550 
flips over and just does just does
barrel<00:07:16.150> rolls<00:07:16.330> what<00:07:16.840> you<00:07:16.960> want<00:07:17.110> to<00:07:17.169> do<00:07:17.289> is<00:07:17.409> you

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
barrel rolls what you want to do is you

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.629 
barrel rolls what you want to do is you
make<00:07:17.740> sure<00:07:17.770> and<00:07:18.400> you<00:07:20.009> take<00:07:21.009> your<00:07:21.039> plane<00:07:21.400> and

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
make sure and you take your plane and

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.339 
make sure and you take your plane and
promote<00:07:21.880> it<00:07:22.000> like<00:07:22.150> this<00:07:22.360> up<00:07:22.599> to<00:07:22.629> your<00:07:22.840> eyes<00:07:22.990> and

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:23.349 
promote it like this up to your eyes and

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:26.790 
promote it like this up to your eyes and
for<00:07:24.280> the<00:07:24.370> rear<00:07:24.580> view<00:07:24.909> and<00:07:25.659> then<00:07:25.870> you<00:07:26.289> fold<00:07:26.650> your

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
for the rear view and then you fold your

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.570 
for the rear view and then you fold your
wings<00:07:26.919> up<00:07:27.310> so<00:07:27.699> that<00:07:27.819> forms<00:07:28.180> a<00:07:28.300> Y<00:07:28.509> shape<00:07:29.400> if<00:07:30.400> you

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
wings up so that forms a Y shape if you

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.610 
wings up so that forms a Y shape if you
see<00:07:30.729> what<00:07:30.849> I<00:07:30.880> mean<00:07:31.979> if<00:07:33.060> if<00:07:34.060> you<00:07:34.270> don't<00:07:34.590> have<00:07:35.590> a

see what I mean if if you don't have a

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.200 
see what I mean if if you don't have a
y-shaped<00:07:35.889> that's<00:07:36.460> your<00:07:36.610> problem

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210 
y-shaped that's your problem
