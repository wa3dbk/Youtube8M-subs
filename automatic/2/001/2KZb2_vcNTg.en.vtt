00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.860
 Trees are the largest organisms on Earth. 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.760
 But where do you get that mass to grow? 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 Take nutrients from the ground 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Oxygen or anything good from the soil 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.400
 Come from the soil! 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.340
 Yeah. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.880
 Good! 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.520
 Why is there no big hole around the tree where the soil is removed? 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.220
 Doing this soil gradually makes the soil time for recovery. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.740
 It is obvious that trees take most of the soil 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.600
 You see the roots digging into the soil and you have to take something from there 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.920
 I mean the tree looks like soil and its stubble. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.580
 But not so! 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.040
 In the early 1960s, there was the world of Johan Peptista van Helmut, trying to figure out where the tree mass came from. 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.080
 So, take a pot of soil and measured the amount of soil in it. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680
 He then planted a tree and cared for it for five years 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 And make sure that no soil is added or left to build. 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.480
 At the end of the experiment, he weighed the tree to find 72 kg 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.060
 But the soil mass was 60 grams lower. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.660
 This is a strong evidence that the mass of the tree is not from the soil. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.840
 I did not think about it really before because she did not eat anything, mad. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780
 Do not eat something? 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.340
 No ! 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.980
 Just absorb 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 Do not eat anything! 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580
 Yeah ! 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 That's all you eat. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.660
 Well, supposed water and food from the soil 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.760
 Is there anything else besides water and soil? 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.880
 Seed is not it? 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.540
 Seeds in soil and water become a large tree 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 Johan concluded, of course, that the tree was made entirely of water 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.000
 Now, that is not true it has been on track 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 Aware that the mass of the tree is not from the soil. 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.520
 Soil, and solar energy. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.860
 Solar energy! 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 Yeah! 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 Is the energy turned into a mass? 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 Do you understand what I'm saying? 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.460
 Yes I understand 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.680
 There were no things after which there were things, where did they come from? 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.180
 Charm! 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.060
 I have no idea. 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.420
 My question is: Where do you get that mass to grow big? 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 from the sun. 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 Of the rain. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 The sun is supposed. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.860
 Sun light. 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 Sun light. 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.540
 Sun rays. 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.000
 Sun rays! 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.580
 Do you add a block to the tree? 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.720
 Yes, it will not grow without it. 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960
 I do not know how to be a mass but do not grow without it. 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.800
 Of course, solar energy is necessary for the tree to build material for its branches and leaves 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.860
 But the sun itself is not material. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.780
 Well, suppose it was a wonderful atmosphere as well. 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320
 What is the obstacle? 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.780
 I think air is important as well. 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780
 oxygen. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 Trees need oxygen. 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.040
 I think oxygen. 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.480
 Oxygen of course. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.640
 oxygen! 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.580
 Yeah! 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 Are there any missing items? 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 Carbon Dioxide 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.400
 Carbon Dioxide 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.980
 So, will you be surprised if you know that 95% of the tree comes from carbon dioxide? 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.340
 Trees are made largely from air 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.680
 Okay! 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 I needed a reaction like ooh. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.480
 Oh my God! 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.980
 So it turned out that most trees are made of air. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.800
 Of the carbon dioxide it absorbs. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.020
 It's fun to extract carbon dioxide and water 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900
 And so we lose mass 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.560
 But the grain inhales exactly to gain the mass 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.440
 So, imagine that a closed device where you and the tree only 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.940
 Carbon dioxide and water will be removed and taken by the tree 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.900
 It becomes smaller while the tree is larger 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.260
 It becomes a tree to some extent. 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.580
