the<00:02:53.160> key<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> voice<00:02:54.300> coils<00:02:54.840> poles

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the key is that the voice coils poles

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.500 
the key is that the voice coils poles
are<00:02:55.590> constantly<00:02:56.250> reversing<00:02:56.940> position

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
are constantly reversing position

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
are constantly reversing position
because<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.290> electrical<00:02:58.830> current<00:02:59.220> running

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
because the electrical current running

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.090 
because the electrical current running
to<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> speaker<00:03:00.330> is<00:03:00.510> an<00:03:00.840> alternating<00:03:01.680> current

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
to the speaker is an alternating current

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.640 
to the speaker is an alternating current
meaning<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.240> switches<00:03:03.540> between<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:04.080> positive

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
meaning it switches between a positive

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
meaning it switches between a positive
and<00:03:04.830> negative<00:03:05.250> charge<00:03:05.580> several<00:03:06.360> times<00:03:06.390> per

and negative charge several times per
second<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:08.400> makes<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> magnets<00:03:09.300> attract

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
second this makes the magnets attract

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.650 
second this makes the magnets attract
and<00:03:09.990> repel<00:03:10.140> each<00:03:10.530> other<00:03:10.710> continuously

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
and repel each other continuously

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
and repel each other continuously
causing<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> voice<00:03:12.990> coil<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.680> move<00:03:13.860> back<00:03:14.130> and
