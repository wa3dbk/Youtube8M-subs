00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
on-screen so let's get started so there
are<00:00:27.240> two<00:00:27.390> basic<00:00:27.750> phases<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.590> fight<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
are two basic phases to this fight the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.479 
are two basic phases to this fight the
siege<00:00:30.210> mode<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> assault<00:00:30.990> mode

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
siege mode in the assault mode

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
siege mode in the assault mode
throughout<00:00:32.489> both<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.809> main

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
throughout both of these the main

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.770 
throughout both of these the main
mechanic<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> most<00:00:36.180> important<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
mechanic that will be most important to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.770 
mechanic that will be most important to
worry<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.730> mines<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:39.360> crawler<00:00:39.629> mines

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
worry about is mines they crawler mines

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
worry about is mines they crawler mines
the<00:00:40.710> reason<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.760> deal

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the reason for this is that these deal

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
the reason for this is that these deal
the<00:00:42.270> most<00:00:42.480> significant<00:00:43.140> single<00:00:43.710> target<00:00:44.100> spike

the tank that is basically not on the
boss<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> time<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:06.240> try<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> soak<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
boss at the time will try to soak up the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
boss at the time will try to soak up the
majority<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:07.790> however<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:09.060> he<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.510> she

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
majority of these however if he or she

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
majority of these however if he or she
is<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.500> other<00:01:10.979> players<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is not able to do so other players in

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
is not able to do so other players in
the<00:01:11.640> raid<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.840> pick<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the raid can and should pick them up the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.249 
the raid can and should pick them up the
idea<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:16.229> or

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
idea is that you do not want two or

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.789 
idea is that you do not want two or
three<00:01:16.860> mines<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.460> explode<00:01:18.030> simultaneously<00:01:18.810> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
three mines to explode simultaneously so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.080 
three mines to explode simultaneously so
you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.040> 15<00:01:20.400> seconds<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you have 15 seconds in which to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
you have 15 seconds in which to
deactivate<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.500> explode<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> mines

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
deactivate or explode the mines

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.270 
deactivate or explode the mines
purposely<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.159> going

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
purposely so here you can see I'm going

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
purposely so here you can see I'm going
to<00:01:26.340> right-click<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.810> fly<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> air

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to right-click one and fly up in the air

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.010

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
because that's a pretty significant

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.760 
because that's a pretty significant
amount<00:03:24.360> during<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.200> phase<00:03:25.440> when<00:03:25.650> you're

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.410 
afraid to use all your raid cooldowns
during<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.410> phase<00:03:31.650> after<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.880> minute<00:03:33.150> or<00:03:33.270> so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
during that phase after the minute or so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.360 
during that phase after the minute or so
is<00:03:33.600> up<00:03:33.750> he'll<00:03:34.350> go<00:03:34.500> back<00:03:34.650> into<00:03:34.800> assault<00:03:35.160> mode

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
is up he'll go back into assault mode

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.640 
is up he'll go back into assault mode
and<00:03:35.790> things<00:03:36.300> will<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.720> much<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:37.410> stable

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and things will get much more stable

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.130 
and things will get much more stable
from<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.910> things<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.870> repeat

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
from there and just things just repeat

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.780 
from there and just things just repeat
after<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.100> real<00:03:41.250> basic<00:03:41.400> fight

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
after that it's a real basic fight

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.270 
after that it's a real basic fight
