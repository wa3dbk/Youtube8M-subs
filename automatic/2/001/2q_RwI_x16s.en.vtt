00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
greater than less than and equal to when

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.539 
greater than less than and equal to when
you<00:00:04.110> compare<00:00:04.529> numbers<00:00:04.740> you're<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.430> use

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
you compare numbers you're going to use

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.000 
you compare numbers you're going to use
one<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.879> three<00:00:06.060> symbols<00:00:06.660> you're<00:00:07.589> going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> use

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
one of three symbols you're going to use

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250 
one of three symbols you're going to use
the<00:00:08.220> greater<00:00:08.550> than<00:00:08.670> symbol<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.780> arrow<00:00:10.019> that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the greater than symbol the arrow that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.379 
the greater than symbol the arrow that
points<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> right<00:00:11.070> means<00:00:11.519> greater<00:00:12.059> than

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
points to the right means greater than

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.430 
points to the right means greater than
so<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.049> reads<00:00:13.500> five<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.190> greater<00:00:14.460> than<00:00:14.940> three

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
so this reads five is greater than three

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.840 
so this reads five is greater than three
perhaps<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.710> would<00:00:16.859> use<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> less<00:00:17.640> than

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
perhaps you would use the is less than

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.910 
perhaps you would use the is less than
symbol<00:00:18.359> an<00:00:18.510> arrow<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.199> points<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> left

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
symbol an arrow that points to the left

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.670 
symbol an arrow that points to the left
is<00:00:20.369> red<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> less<00:00:21.150> than<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.930> says<00:00:22.199> three

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
is red is less than and this says three

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.859 
is red is less than and this says three
is<00:00:22.890> less<00:00:23.250> than<00:00:23.490> six<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.570> course<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
is less than six and of course the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.970 
is less than six and of course the
symbol<00:00:25.170> you're<00:00:25.260> probably<00:00:25.470> most<00:00:25.830> familiar

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
symbol you're probably most familiar

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.089 
symbol you're probably most familiar
with<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.820> equal<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.500> symbol<00:00:28.800> means<00:00:28.949> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
with is equal to this symbol means is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
with is equal to this symbol means is
equal<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.000> read<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> eight<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> equal

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
equal to and we read it eight is equal

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:31.939 
equal to and we read it eight is equal
to<00:00:31.439> eight

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

whenever<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.700> comparing<00:00:33.120> two<00:00:33.360> numbers

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
whenever you're comparing two numbers

whenever you're comparing two numbers
what<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> want<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.620> able<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.399> decide

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
what you want to be able to do is decide

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
what you want to be able to do is decide
which<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> these<00:00:36.270> signs<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.079> most

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
which of these signs is the most

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.069 
which of these signs is the most
appropriate<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> use<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> example<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
appropriate one to use for example if I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
appropriate one to use for example if I
was<00:00:40.440> comparing<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> numbers<00:00:41.430> 14<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> six<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
was comparing the numbers 14 and six I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
was comparing the numbers 14 and six I
know<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.469> 14<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> bigger<00:00:44.280> than<00:00:44.460> six<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.030> I

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
know that 14 is bigger than six so I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
know that 14 is bigger than six so I
would<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> use<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.170> greater<00:00:46.500> than

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
would want to use the is greater than

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.729 
would want to use the is greater than
symbol<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.969> would<00:00:48.149> write<00:00:48.360> 14<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.289> greater

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
symbol and I would write 14 is greater

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
symbol and I would write 14 is greater
than<00:00:49.950> six<00:00:50.360> we're<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> work<00:00:51.840> with

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
than six we're going to work with

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
than six we're going to work with
comparing<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.800> signed<00:00:53.129> numbers<00:00:53.610> perhaps

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
comparing some signed numbers perhaps

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
comparing some signed numbers perhaps
you'd<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> compare<00:00:55.350> some<00:00:55.590> other<00:00:55.739> numbers

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
you'd want to compare some other numbers

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
you'd want to compare some other numbers
maybe<00:00:56.579> four<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.360> eleven<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> four

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
maybe four and eleven you know that four

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
maybe four and eleven you know that four
is<00:00:59.280> smaller<00:00:59.670> than<00:00:59.940> eleven<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.510> less<00:01:00.840> than

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
is smaller than eleven or less than

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
is smaller than eleven or less than
eleven<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.710> we'll<00:01:01.890> use<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> less<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.489> symbol

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
eleven so we'll use the less than symbol

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
eleven so we'll use the less than symbol
and<00:01:03.390> we'll<00:01:03.840> say<00:01:04.049> four<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.890> less<00:01:05.189> than<00:01:05.430> eleven

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
and we'll say four is less than eleven

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
and we'll say four is less than eleven
an<00:01:06.060> important<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> remember<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
an important thing to remember is the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
an important thing to remember is the
open<00:01:08.310> end<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> arrow<00:01:08.909> always<00:01:09.240> points

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
open end of the arrow always points

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
open end of the arrow always points
toward<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> larger<00:01:10.799> number<00:01:11.159> we're<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
toward the larger number we're going to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
toward the larger number we're going to
compare<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.689> sign<00:01:12.930> numbers<00:01:13.290> using<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.799> number

numbers two and negative four to start

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
numbers two and negative four to start
with<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:19.170> look<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> number<00:01:19.799> line<00:01:19.830> trying

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to locate these numbers and we see

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.219 
to locate these numbers and we see
negative<00:01:22.170> four<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:23.729> since<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.750> lies<00:01:24.990> to

the right of negative four we know it's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
the right of negative four we know it's
the<00:01:27.180> larger<00:01:27.540> number<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the larger number and we know two is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
the larger number and we know two is
greater<00:01:29.490> than<00:01:29.759> negative<00:01:30.000> four<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.079> we'll<00:01:31.229> use

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
greater than negative four so we'll use

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590

our greater than sign to is greater than
negative<00:01:33.750> four<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.829> right

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

of negative 4 on the number line as
another<00:01:38.130> example<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.759> compare<00:01:39.090> negative

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
another example will compare negative

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
another example will compare negative
four<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.780> two<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.369> negative<00:01:41.549> four

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
four and two if we look at negative four

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.460 
four and two if we look at negative four
we<00:01:42.180> find<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> number<00:01:42.899> line<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
we find it on the number line to the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
we find it on the number line to the
left<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.860> zero<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.729> find<00:01:44.970> two<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
left of zero and we find two to the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
left of zero and we find two to the
right<00:01:45.590> since<00:01:46.590> two<00:01:46.860> lies<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
right since two lies to the right of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.490 
right since two lies to the right of
negative<00:01:47.850> four<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> larger

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
negative four we know it's the larger

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
negative four we know it's the larger
number<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.979> negative<00:01:50.189> four<00:01:50.610> must<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.030> less

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
number and negative four must be less

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
number and negative four must be less
than<00:01:51.390> two<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.710> we'll<00:01:52.860> write<00:01:53.009> negative<00:01:53.250> four<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
than two so we'll write negative four is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.499 
than two so we'll write negative four is
less<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.939> another<00:01:56.939> comparison

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
less than two as another comparison

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
less than two as another comparison
we'll<00:01:57.810> look<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.140> negative<00:01:58.380> four<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:58.950> negative

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
we'll look at negative four and negative

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
we'll look at negative four and negative
two<00:01:59.820> plus<00:02:00.090> negative<00:02:00.210> two<00:02:00.869> when<00:02:01.560> we're<00:02:01.680> adding

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
two plus negative two when we're adding

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
two plus negative two when we're adding
sign<00:02:02.280> numbers<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.939> start<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.390> zero

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
sign numbers we can start at zero

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.109 
sign numbers we can start at zero
negative<00:02:04.500> two<00:02:04.740> moves<00:02:05.130> two<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> left<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
negative two moves two to the left and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029 
negative two moves two to the left and
adding<00:02:06.780> negative<00:02:06.899> two<00:02:07.320> moves<00:02:07.619> two<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
adding negative two moves two to the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
adding negative two moves two to the
left<00:02:08.250> again<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.819> puts<00:02:09.030> us<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.330> negative

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
left again and it puts us on negative

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.020 
left again and it puts us on negative
four<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.250> negative<00:02:11.400> two<00:02:11.790> plus

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
four we know that negative two plus

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
four we know that negative two plus
negative<00:02:12.270> two<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.840> negative

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
negative two is negative

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830 
negative two is negative
or<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.040> these<00:02:14.190> have<00:02:14.400> exactly<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.150> same<00:02:15.180> value

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
or so these have exactly the same value

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780 
or so these have exactly the same value
and<00:02:15.990> we'll<00:02:16.200> say<00:02:16.350> negative<00:02:16.800> 4<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.250> equal<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
and we'll say negative 4 is equal to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.470 
and we'll say negative 4 is equal to
negative<00:02:18.360> 2<00:02:18.810> plus<00:02:19.140> negative<00:02:19.170> 2

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
negative 2 plus negative 2

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400 
negative 2 plus negative 2
finally<00:02:21.480> when<00:02:21.630> we're<00:02:21.750> comparing<00:02:21.870> two

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
finally when we're comparing two

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.170 
finally when we're comparing two
negative<00:02:22.830> numbers<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.310> negative<00:02:23.730> 6<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
negative numbers like negative 6 and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.120 
negative numbers like negative 6 and
negative<00:02:24.210> 4<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.290> only<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.680> find<00:02:25.860> them<00:02:26.010> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
negative 4 we have only to find them on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.190 
negative 4 we have only to find them on
the<00:02:26.250> number<00:02:26.490> line<00:02:26.540> we'll<00:02:27.540> look<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.870> negative

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the number line we'll look for negative

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.550 
the number line we'll look for negative
6<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.800> negative<00:02:29.370> 4<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.690> see<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.020> negative<00:02:31.170> 4

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
6 and negative 4 we see that negative 4

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.550 
6 and negative 4 we see that negative 4
is<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> right<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.670> negative<00:02:33.030> 6<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.410> is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
is to the right of negative 6 so it is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560 
is to the right of negative 6 so it is
the<00:02:34.709> larger<00:02:35.070> number<00:02:35.130> we<00:02:36.090> know<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.420> negative

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
the larger number we know that negative

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.430 
the larger number we know that negative
6<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.440> less<00:02:37.680> than<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:39.440> put

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
6 is less than they get it for put

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.250 
6 is less than they get it for put
negative<00:02:40.620> 6<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.430> less<00:02:41.459> than<00:02:41.850> negative<00:02:42.030> 4<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
negative 6 is less than negative 4 to

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.570 
negative 6 is less than negative 4 to

consider thinking about money that you

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.910 
consider thinking about money that you
owe

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
owing negative 4 dollars is not as big a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
owing negative 4 dollars is not as big a
debt<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.739> owing<00:02:50.010> negative<00:02:50.340> 6<00:02:50.610> you're<00:02:50.790> further

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
debt as owing negative 6 you're further

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.510 
debt as owing negative 6 you're further
in<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> hole<00:02:51.750> with<00:02:52.080> negative<00:02:52.500> 6<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
in the hole with negative 6 so it is a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.760 
in the hole with negative 6 so it is a
smaller<00:02:54.000> number<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.080> left<00:02:55.380> of
