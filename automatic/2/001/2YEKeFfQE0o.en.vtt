you about Jiro cycling shoes now a bit
of<00:00:08.349> a<00:00:08.470> backstory<00:00:08.800> first

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
of a backstory first

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.480 
of a backstory first
Eric<00:00:10.089> Horton<00:00:10.540> used<00:00:10.900> to<00:00:11.049> had<00:00:11.200> a<00:00:11.230> specialized<00:00:11.980> BG

Eric Horton used to had a specialized BG

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.209 
Eric Horton used to had a specialized BG
cycling<00:00:13.030> shoe<00:00:13.209> program<00:00:13.450> and<00:00:14.379> he<00:00:14.740> thought<00:00:14.950> that

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
cycling shoe program and he thought that

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.830 
cycling shoe program and he thought that
while<00:00:15.490> their<00:00:15.700> shoes<00:00:15.940> were<00:00:16.150> really<00:00:16.450> good<00:00:16.630> for

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
while their shoes were really good for

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.080 
while their shoes were really good for
many<00:00:17.020> reasons<00:00:17.529> their<00:00:18.130> design<00:00:18.519> principles

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
many reasons their design principles

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.910 
many reasons their design principles
were<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.510> little<00:00:19.810> bit<00:00:20.080> too<00:00:20.289> rigid<00:00:20.679> for<00:00:20.710> his

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
were a little bit too rigid for his

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.300 
were a little bit too rigid for his
liking<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:22.090> he<00:00:22.779> wound<00:00:22.960> up<00:00:23.080> in<00:00:23.230> zeros<00:00:23.619> hands<00:00:24.099> and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
liking so he wound up in zeros hands and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.220 
liking so he wound up in zeros hands and
they<00:00:24.910> told<00:00:25.150> him<00:00:25.330> he<00:00:25.509> can<00:00:25.660> take<00:00:25.840> whatever

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
they told him he can take whatever

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.410 
they told him he can take whatever
materials<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.099> whatever<00:00:27.220> time<00:00:27.580> necessary<00:00:28.150> to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
materials and whatever time necessary to

materials and whatever time necessary to
make<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.259> shoe<00:00:29.470> best<00:00:30.009> to<00:00:30.220> his<00:00:30.339> liking<00:00:30.900> so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
make the shoe best to his liking so

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.200 
make the shoe best to his liking so
these<00:00:32.650> shoes<00:00:32.980> their<00:00:33.310> biggest<00:00:33.610> selling<00:00:33.880> points

these shoes their biggest selling points

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.420 
these shoes their biggest selling points
can<00:00:34.300> be<00:00:34.330> broken<00:00:34.750> into<00:00:34.900> three<00:00:35.020> categories<00:00:35.860> the

can be broken into three categories the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.670 
can be broken into three categories the

big story with engineering of these

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.050 
big story with engineering of these
shoes<00:00:44.140> was<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.830> Jiro<00:00:45.280> teamed<00:00:45.610> up<00:00:45.820> with

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
shoes was that Jiro teamed up with

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.900 
shoes was that Jiro teamed up with
Eastern<00:00:46.600> Harbin<00:00:46.960> sports<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:48.100> design<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.460> carbon

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
design as well as manufacturer of carbon

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.340 
design as well as manufacturer of carbon
and<00:01:00.400> what<00:01:00.730> they<00:01:00.850> gave<00:01:01.060> this<00:01:01.210> project<00:01:01.720> was<00:01:02.050> a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
and what they gave this project was a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.229 
and what they gave this project was a
carbon<00:01:03.340> outsole<00:01:03.700> with<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:03.970> highest

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
carbon outsole with the highest

stiffness to weight ratio on the market

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.999 
stiffness to weight ratio on the market
one<00:01:07.719> thing<00:01:07.899> that<00:01:08.020> strikes<00:01:08.200> me<00:01:08.350> about<00:01:08.439> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
one thing that strikes me about the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.480 
one thing that strikes me about the
soles<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:11.289> heel<00:01:11.679> step<00:01:12.009> as<00:01:12.250> well<00:01:12.399> as

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
soles is that the heel step as well as

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.039 
soles is that the heel step as well as
the<00:01:12.609> toe<00:01:12.789> step<00:01:13.060> are<00:01:13.539> actually<00:01:13.899> not

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
the toe step are actually not

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.709 
the toe step are actually not
replaceable<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.039> time<00:01:15.429> will<00:01:15.579> tell<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:15.969> see<00:01:16.210> how

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
replaceable so time will tell to see how

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.620 
replaceable so time will tell to see how
well<00:01:16.929> they<00:01:17.079> go<00:01:17.259> about<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:18.149> with<00:01:19.149> respect<00:01:19.299> to

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
well they go about it with respect to

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.039 
well they go about it with respect to
the<00:01:19.719> upper<00:01:20.399> it's<00:01:21.399> made<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.880> tasia<00:01:22.299> 100

are so what we have here is a upper
that's<00:01:44.990> actually<00:01:45.560> overkill<00:01:46.040> for<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> cyclist

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
that's actually overkill for a cyclist

strong and breathable the last point

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.260 
strong and breathable the last point
with<00:01:54.409> engineering<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.580> if<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:55.940> look<00:01:56.149> at

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
with engineering is that if you look at

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.100 
with engineering is that if you look at
the<00:01:56.420> way<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.049> straps<00:01:58.119> line<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.360> linearly

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
the way the straps line up linearly

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.710 
the way the straps line up linearly
they're<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.670> same<00:02:01.910> line<00:02:02.179> so<00:02:02.479> you'll

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
they're not in the same line so you'll

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.899 
they're not in the same line so you'll
never<00:02:02.869> actually<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:03.560> hotspots<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> same

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
never actually get hotspots to the same

arch support issues so if you think
about<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:06.010> makes<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.370> lot<00:03:06.520> of<00:03:06.550> sense<00:03:06.910> most

inside<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.540> shoe<00:03:13.810> what's<00:03:14.560> happening<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.160> when

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
inside the shoe what's happening is when

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
inside the shoe what's happening is when

down to fill the volume of the shoe and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.310 
down to fill the volume of the shoe and
potentially<00:03:25.030> your<00:03:25.180> toes<00:03:25.450> move<00:03:25.810> forward

creating<00:03:26.709> fictional<00:03:27.190> hotspots<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.090> then

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
creating fictional hotspots and then

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.949

only once the foot is completely

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.510 
only once the foot is completely
collapsed<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.620> start<00:03:32.890> applying<00:03:33.100> pressure

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
collapsed you start applying pressure

becomes<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:37.060> big<00:03:37.270> issue<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.500> what<00:03:38.740> they've<00:03:38.890> done

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920
