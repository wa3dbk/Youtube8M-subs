00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
smells okay like it has a nice smell I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
smells okay like it has a nice smell I
mean<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> does<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.070> vitamin<00:01:38.430> E<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
mean it does have vitamin E in it so I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
mean it does have vitamin E in it so I
don't<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.460> smell

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
don't know you know what kind of smell

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
don't know you know what kind of smell
that<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.180> anything<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.369> only<00:01:44.549> has

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that has or anything so it only has

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.620 
that has or anything so it only has
thirty<00:01:45.000> percent<00:01:45.360> petroleum<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.360> means

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
thirty percent petroleum so this means

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
thirty percent petroleum so this means
that<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.049> guess<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.649> has<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.520> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.000> vitamin<00:01:51.390> E

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that I guess it has a lot of vitamin E

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
that I guess it has a lot of vitamin E
which<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.500> vitamin<00:01:53.189> E<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:54.000> for

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
which is good vitamin E is very good for

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
which is good vitamin E is very good for
