00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.280 
video so far things went quite well at
first<00:02:32.660> until<00:02:33.230> things<00:02:33.590> didn't<00:02:34.010> go<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.489> well

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
first until things didn't go so well

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.569 
first until things didn't go so well
then<00:02:36.290> some<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.769> screws<00:02:37.040> were<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> bit

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
then some of the screws were a bit

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.890 
then some of the screws were a bit
tougher<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.390> unscrew<00:02:39.200> oh<00:02:39.730> come<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.940> they<00:02:41.299> put

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
tougher to unscrew oh come on they put

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.640 
tougher to unscrew oh come on they put
Bru's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.580 

probably<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.760> stop<00:02:46.060> people<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.540> us<00:02:46.960> painting

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
probably to stop people like us painting

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.150 
probably to stop people like us painting
it<00:02:48.660> well<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.690> fought<00:02:50.110> Locke<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.530> talking<00:02:51.010> out

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it well I fought Locke was talking out

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.190 
it well I fought Locke was talking out
of<00:02:51.190> his<00:02:51.400> rectal<00:02:51.910> passage<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:52.720> either<00:02:52.900> go

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
of his rectal passage so either go

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.320 
of his rectal passage so either go
myself<00:02:53.470> although<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.610> turns<00:02:54.819> out<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.209> he

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
myself although it turns out that he

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.720 
myself although it turns out that he
wasn't<00:02:55.750> lying<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.500> screws<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.310> tough

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
wasn't lying the screws are so tough

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.460 
wasn't lying the screws are so tough
that<00:02:57.760> our<00:02:58.060> cheap<00:02:58.390> Chinese<00:02:58.840> screwdrivers

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that our cheap Chinese screwdrivers

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.140 
that our cheap Chinese screwdrivers
weren't<00:02:59.740> having<00:02:59.920> any<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.760> deny<00:03:01.660> your<00:03:02.110> job

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
weren't having any of it deny your job

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.780 
weren't having any of it deny your job
so<00:03:04.590> Locke<00:03:05.590> versus<00:03:06.100> cannon

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
so Locke versus cannon

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.030 
so Locke versus cannon
well<00:03:07.120> canon<00:03:07.630> came<00:03:07.870> out<00:03:08.020> on<00:03:08.200> top<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.709> we<00:03:08.740> had<00:03:08.920> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
well canon came out on top so we had to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.580 
well canon came out on top so we had to
change<00:03:09.280> plans<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.630> time<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:11.170> decide<00:03:11.470> to

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
change plans this time we decide to

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.530 
change plans this time we decide to
paint<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.160> without<00:03:12.459> disassembling<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.390> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
paint it without disassembling it and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.410 
paint it without disassembling it and
this<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> very<00:03:14.470> risky<00:03:14.860> procedure<00:03:15.489> with<00:03:16.300> all

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
this is a very risky procedure with all

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.030 
this is a very risky procedure with all
electronic<00:03:17.020> bits<00:03:17.200> still<00:03:17.500> attached<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
electronic bits still attached to the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.090 
electronic bits still attached to the
shell<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:19.060> risk<00:03:19.390> damaging<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.200> completely<00:03:20.860> new

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
shell we risk damaging a completely new

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.020 
shell we risk damaging a completely new
camera<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.290> was<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> massive<00:03:23.860> epic<00:03:24.610> fail

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
camera so that was a massive epic fail

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.949 
camera so that was a massive epic fail
wasn't<00:03:25.540> it

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
wasn't it

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.570 
wasn't it
we're<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.830> gonna<00:03:26.980> have<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.130> do<00:03:27.310> without

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
we're just gonna have to do without

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.610 
we're just gonna have to do without

tape up properly it's gonna get so I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.870 
tape up properly it's gonna get so I

and tears so there we have it we've
successfully<00:03:58.360> mummified<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.590> 600d<00:04:00.220> now

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
successfully mummified the 600d now

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:13.070 
successfully mummified the 600d now
let's<00:04:01.750> paint<00:04:02.019> it

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080

busy year for me why do people always
have<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.210> call<00:04:46.419> it<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.720> most<00:04:46.930> inconvenient

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
have to call it the most inconvenient

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.270 
have to call it the most inconvenient
time<00:04:48.100> right<00:04:48.639> stuff<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.360> let's<00:04:49.600> paint<00:04:50.280> switch

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
time right stuff it let's paint switch

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:09.680 
time right stuff it let's paint switch
on<00:04:51.460> silent<00:04:58.470> hey<00:05:01.710> let's<00:05:02.710> get<00:05:03.039> ready<00:05:03.550> -<00:05:05.190> yeah

okay that's done let's go back to HQ our

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.990 
okay that's done let's go back to HQ our
secret<00:05:16.810> underground<00:05:17.050> bunker<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:18.550> here's<00:05:18.820> one

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
secret underground bunker so here's one

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.210 
secret underground bunker so here's one
I<00:05:19.030> made<00:05:19.150> earlier<00:05:19.330> well<00:05:20.080> it's<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> same<00:05:20.740> one<00:05:20.950> is
