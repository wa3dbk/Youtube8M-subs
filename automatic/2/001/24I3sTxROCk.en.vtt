synthetic<00:02:24.010> air<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.610> do<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.569> go<00:02:25.750> any<00:02:25.900> higher

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
synthetic air one do not go any higher

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.970 
synthetic air one do not go any higher
on<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:27.220> future<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.730> hair<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.410> can<00:02:29.590> go<00:02:29.739> higher

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
on the future of hair you can go higher

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.140 
on the future of hair you can go higher
you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.519> high<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.760> an<00:02:31.060> eighth<00:02:31.269> on<00:02:31.510> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
you can go as high as an eighth on that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.770 
you can go as high as an eighth on that
but<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.690> not<00:02:34.900> future<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:37.120> non

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
but this is not future this is a non

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.390 
but this is not future this is a non
heat-resistant<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> show<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
heat-resistant but I'm going to show you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.360 
heat-resistant but I'm going to show you
that<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.820> heat-resistant<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.920> some<00:02:42.340> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
that it is heat-resistant I know some of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.940 
that it is heat-resistant I know some of
you<00:02:42.670> watching<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.750> probably<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.590> already

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
you watching this probably have already

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.930 
you watching this probably have already
seen<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.400> done<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.239> million<00:02:47.140> times<00:02:47.610> hmm<00:02:48.640> but

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
seen this done a million times hmm but

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.430 
seen this done a million times hmm but
I'm<00:02:49.180> doing<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.900> people<00:02:50.050> who<00:02:50.230> don't

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
I'm doing it for the people who don't

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.650 
I'm doing it for the people who don't
know<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.330> little<00:02:52.840> secret<00:02:55.140> excuse<00:02:56.140> me

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
know about this little secret excuse me

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.710 
know about this little secret excuse me
so<00:02:58.660> hold<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.080> there<00:02:59.290> about<00:02:59.910> twenty<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.360> thirty

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
so hold it there about twenty to thirty

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120 
so hold it there about twenty to thirty
seconds<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.709> will<00:03:03.700> probably<00:03:04.150> suffice<00:03:05.130> if

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
seconds is will probably suffice if

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.920 
seconds is will probably suffice if
you're<00:03:06.519> taking<00:03:06.910> thinner<00:03:07.180> pieces<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.750> hair

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
you're taking thinner pieces of hair

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.190 
you're taking thinner pieces of hair
don't<00:03:08.290> hold<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.920> probably<00:03:09.280> ten<00:03:10.200> seconds

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
don't hold it you probably ten seconds

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.560 
don't hold it you probably ten seconds
is<00:03:11.320> enough<00:03:11.440> because<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.040> hair<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.610> water<00:03:13.420> is

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
is enough because the hair the water is

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.300 
is enough because the hair the water is
going<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.840> evaporate<00:03:13.930> from<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.620> hair<00:03:14.890> much

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
going to evaporate from the hair much

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.370 
going to evaporate from the hair much
much<00:03:15.549> faster<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.269> thicker<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:17.019> time<00:03:17.260> it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
much faster the thicker the more time it

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.890 
much faster the thicker the more time it
takes<00:03:17.410> for<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.950> water<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.430> evaporate<00:03:19.060> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
takes for the water to evaporate you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.960 
takes for the water to evaporate you
don't<00:03:20.110> want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> let<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.620> completely<00:03:20.970> operate

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
don't want to let it completely operate

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.940 
don't want to let it completely operate
on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.540> curling<00:03:22.750> iron<00:03:23.049> because<00:03:23.440> then<00:03:23.739> you're

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
on the curling iron because then you're

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.789 
on the curling iron because then you're
going<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.160> start<00:03:24.459> melting<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.780> hair<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.440> you

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
going to start melting the hair and you

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.349 
going to start melting the hair and you
don't<00:03:27.040> want<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.760> do<00:03:27.910> that

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.020 

so<00:03:31.359> you're<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.739> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.070> pin<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> up<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:33.850> I

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so you're just going to pin it up like I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.560 
so you're just going to pin it up like I
just<00:03:34.090> did<00:03:35.430> grab<00:03:36.430> yourself<00:03:36.910> another<00:03:37.239> piece<00:03:37.540> of

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
just did grab yourself another piece of

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.360 
just did grab yourself another piece of
hair<00:03:40.590> spurts<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.580 

brush<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.579> through<00:03:47.930> make<00:03:48.930> sure<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.230> get<00:03:49.349> all

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
brush it through make sure you get all

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.229 
brush it through make sure you get all
the<00:03:49.739> water<00:03:50.010> all<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.489> down<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.939> ends

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
the water all the way down to the ends

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.599 
the water all the way down to the ends
because<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.170> when<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> first<00:03:52.739> started<00:03:53.400> doing

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
because I when I first started doing

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.729 
because I when I first started doing
this<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:54.000> did<00:03:54.180> make<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.390> mistake<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:55.109> didn't<00:03:55.650> get

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
this I did make a mistake and didn't get

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.349 
this I did make a mistake and didn't get
all<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.980> way<00:03:56.069> down<00:03:56.280> at<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.489> end<00:03:56.579> curled<00:03:57.180> it

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
all the way down at the end curled it

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.819 
all the way down at the end curled it
and<00:03:57.540> melted<00:03:58.049> it

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
and melted it

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.750 
and melted it
however<00:03:59.579> curling<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.299> any<00:04:00.599> of<00:04:00.750> those<00:04:00.870> little

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
however curling this any of those little

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.289 
however curling this any of those little
frizzy<00:04:02.760> split<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.569> looking<00:04:04.790> pieces<00:04:05.790> it's

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
frizzy split and looking pieces it's

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.319 
frizzy split and looking pieces it's
going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> smooth<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.530> fiber<00:04:08.250> back<00:04:08.639> down<00:04:08.939> and

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
going to smooth the fiber back down and

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.589 
going to smooth the fiber back down and
make<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.349> hair<00:04:10.560> look<00:04:10.590> renewed<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.700> if<00:04:12.030> you're

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
make the hair look renewed so if you're

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.539 
make the hair look renewed so if you're
thinking<00:04:12.810> about<00:04:13.019> throwing<00:04:13.590> away<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.129> old

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
thinking about throwing away that old

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.710 
thinking about throwing away that old
wig<00:04:15.259> don't<00:04:16.259> do<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.680> try<00:04:17.009> this<00:04:17.070> first<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:18.570> if

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
wig don't do it try this first see if

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.349 
wig don't do it try this first see if
you<00:04:18.900> can<00:04:19.109> come<00:04:19.410> up<00:04:19.500> with<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.709> style<00:04:20.039> I'm<00:04:20.359> almost

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
you can come up with a style I'm almost

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.890 
you can come up with a style I'm almost
sure<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:22.759> that<00:04:23.759> you<00:04:23.940> can<00:04:24.150> restore<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.750> wig

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
sure that that you can restore the wig

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.469 
sure that that you can restore the wig
to<00:04:25.110> looking<00:04:25.440> much<00:04:25.650> much<00:04:25.889> nicer<00:04:26.449> actually<00:04:27.449> I

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
to looking much much nicer actually I

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.570 
to looking much much nicer actually I
think<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:28.470> funny<00:04:28.740> thing<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:31.580> think

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
think the funny thing is is that I think

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.570 
think the funny thing is is that I think
with<00:04:32.849> synthetic<00:04:33.539> wigs<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.229> much<00:04:34.620> easier

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
with synthetic wigs it's much easier

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.999 
with synthetic wigs it's much easier
when<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.270> apply<00:04:36.720> heat<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.530> make<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.430> look<00:04:40.009> new

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
when you apply heat to make it look new

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.060 
when you apply heat to make it look new
again<00:04:41.039> versus<00:04:42.030> human<00:04:42.330> hair<00:04:42.539> human<00:04:43.530> hair<00:04:43.740> you

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
again versus human hair human hair you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.020 
again versus human hair human hair you
get<00:04:44.250> split<00:04:44.520> ends<00:04:44.669> it's<00:04:44.880> kind<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.180> tough<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.479> uh

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030
