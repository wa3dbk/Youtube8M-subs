00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
cool because you just go through all the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.430 
cool because you just go through all the
gates<00:02:40.040> through<00:02:40.819> avoid<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.480> jump<00:02:41.720> forward<00:02:42.049> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
gates through avoid to jump forward and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.339

then just touch the red post and then

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.130 
then just touch the red post and then
make<00:02:45.590> your<00:02:45.829> way<00:02:45.890> towards<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:46.910> bottom<00:02:47.450> going

make your way towards the bottom going
through<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.650> gate<00:02:48.920> here<00:02:49.250> everything<00:02:49.819> starts

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
through this gate here everything starts

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.640 
through this gate here everything starts
to<00:02:50.269> look<00:02:50.420> familiar<00:02:50.599> because<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.470> is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to look familiar because this is

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.400 
to look familiar because this is
actually<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.519> entranceway<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.900> Darkmoon

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
actually the entranceway to the Darkmoon

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.500 
actually the entranceway to the Darkmoon
Faire<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.069> used<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.489> number<00:02:55.790> 2<00:02:56.000> button<00:02:56.359> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
Faire so I used the number 2 button to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.229 
Faire so I used the number 2 button to
lift<00:02:56.720> myself<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.890> number<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.459> button<00:02:58.790> to

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
lift myself the number one button to

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.509 
lift myself the number one button to
give<00:02:59.359> myself<00:02:59.569> big<00:03:00.260> momentum<00:03:00.920> while<00:03:01.280> I'm<00:03:01.400> in

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
give myself big momentum while I'm in

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.800 
give myself big momentum while I'm in
the<00:03:01.640> air<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.209> then<00:03:02.720> let<00:03:02.989> myself<00:03:03.230> glide<00:03:04.099> down

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the air and then let myself glide down

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.899 
the air and then let myself glide down
using<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:06.049> rocket<00:03:06.680> number<00:03:06.829> one<00:03:07.190> button<00:03:07.700> to

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
using my rocket number one button to

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.789 
using my rocket number one button to
propel<00:03:08.269> myself<00:03:08.420> even<00:03:08.750> further<00:03:08.840> forward<00:03:09.409> and

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
propel myself even further forward and

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.430 
propel myself even further forward and
the<00:03:10.190> number<00:03:10.459> two<00:03:10.730> before<00:03:11.599> I'm<00:03:11.659> about<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> land

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the number two before I'm about to land

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.130 
the number two before I'm about to land
to<00:03:13.069> just<00:03:13.310> give<00:03:13.459> ourselves<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:14.180> much<00:03:14.209> momentum

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
to just give ourselves so much momentum

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
to just give ourselves so much momentum
then<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.829> used<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.400> couple<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.790> boots<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.269> give<00:03:17.419> me

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
then I used a couple of boots to give me

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.720 
then I used a couple of boots to give me
a<00:03:17.540> little<00:03:17.690> bit<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:17.989> speed<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.220> circle

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
a little bit of a speed then the circle

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.909 
a little bit of a speed then the circle
the<00:03:19.880> void<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.690> zap<00:03:20.930> me<00:03:21.109> through<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.620> then

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
the void to zap me through and then

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.780 
the void to zap me through and then
whoosh<00:03:22.660> through<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.169> gate<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:25.099> finish<00:03:25.519> off

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
whoosh through the gate to finish off

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.619

green gate lots of kind of mistakes

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.280 
green gate lots of kind of mistakes
which<00:03:51.470> could<00:03:51.739> easily<00:03:52.250> be<00:03:52.900> tightened<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:54.019> by

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
which could easily be tightened up by

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.580 
which could easily be tightened up by
you<00:03:54.349> there<00:03:54.739> that's<00:03:55.040> your<00:03:55.900> your<00:03:56.900> area<00:03:57.379> for

into the into the race and get yourself
up<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.459> speed<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:02.120> was<00:04:02.599> like<00:04:02.780> hanging<00:04:03.109> around

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
up to speed I was like hanging around

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.550 
up to speed I was like hanging around
the<00:04:03.680> outside<00:04:04.160> edges<00:04:04.750> running<00:04:05.750> into<00:04:06.079> trees<00:04:06.530> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
the outside edges running into trees and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.129 
the outside edges running into trees and
then<00:04:07.099> when<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.310> flew<00:04:08.090> over<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.540> edge<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.930> try

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
then when I flew over the edge to try

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.599 
then when I flew over the edge to try
and<00:04:09.260> get<00:04:09.379> into<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.650> green<00:04:09.889> gate<00:04:10.220> as<00:04:10.400> just

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
and get into the green gate as just

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.089 
and get into the green gate as just
spinning<00:04:10.970> myself<00:04:11.269> down<00:04:11.629> with<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.500> parachute

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099

to<00:04:13.250> try<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.549> get<00:04:13.669> through<00:04:13.879> it<00:04:13.910> as<00:04:14.030> quickly<00:04:14.269> as

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.930 
to try and get through it as quickly as
possible<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.109> plenty<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.099> margin<00:04:16.639> of<00:04:16.760> error

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
possible so plenty of margin of error

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.229 
possible so plenty of margin of error
that<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.389> can<00:04:17.709> use<00:04:18.709> here<00:04:18.739> plenty<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.699> mistakes

that you can use here plenty of mistakes
or<00:04:20.570> potential<00:04:21.169> areas<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.890> mistakes<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.460> you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
or potential areas of mistakes that you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.149 
or potential areas of mistakes that you
can<00:04:22.700> still<00:04:23.060> make<00:04:23.390> back<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.620> back<00:04:24.860> half
