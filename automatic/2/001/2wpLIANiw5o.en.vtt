00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.550

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.350
 and 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.700

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.309
 guitar i will start with my favorite models this 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.920
 tele caster is not with him somehow easier to live 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.790
 here and this telecaster uneasy 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.780
 especially the telecaster 72 custom japanese 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.730
 production famous 3 bolt 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.190
 mount alder body maple neck 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.680
 without lining in my yes thin 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.570
 quite comfortable in general telly in my 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 outstanding here and here with so that's quite 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.979
 cool and cute sensor intel here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.320
 test today instead of boogie 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.660
 f50 instead of a combo of course in general 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.580
 not a finder but still a clean channel 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.950
 it is quite as good a drive is 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.190
 so nothing so let's play today in 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.190
 him 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.960
 Here is the TV has a very radical difference 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.490
 in the sound of this here because 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.690
 so even though he is single 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.830
 special very single 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.540
 very so deep so and even buzzing 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 really actually very cool sounds 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.230
 here and of course the standard is this one 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.160
 trade 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.160
 bridge 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 but the nature of the sound on this st 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.030
 tele you can get anything 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 there is everything what he likes in general he will give 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.450
 Now let's see healthy but meat 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.610
 Of course I say again, that is all 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.010
 still more modern scott but still 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.510
 f50 is not the most evil option what 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.040
 maybe that's why I think nothing 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.100
 terrible will not turn off the gifted 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.160
 channel here and see what happens in 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.160
 us 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.910
 but 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.319
 but 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.350
 and 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.580
 the world 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:37.759
 Well, here is such a reef but generally speaking 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.399
 similar telly naturally remember telly 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.099
 there whale richards from the group rolling 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:46.279
 stones Well, in general, here are similar 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.679
 simple things there from the soul can be wet 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:51.349
 Here are such reefs in different ways completely 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:54.800
 will sound in my opinion very very 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:57.889
 explanatory tool that's so Welkom 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.969
