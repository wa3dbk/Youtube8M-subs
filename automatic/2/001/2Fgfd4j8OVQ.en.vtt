00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 we are going to need a big candle 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.350
 of the color that you want from 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.080
 Christmas colors preference 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.640
 a glass container either round 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.800
 or square 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.690
 we are also going to need a strip of 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.580
 thin cardboard 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.130
 scissors 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.400
 a few silicones and of course the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.500
 silicone pistolite 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.750
 we are going to need the type of 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.060
 flower they are going to put either poinsettia 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.500
 or any Christmas arrangement that goes to 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.110
 use 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.700
 and finally a piece of lath 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 Christmas preference 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.650
 let's go folding the cardboard strip 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 in this way in the event that 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.530
 our container is round so that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 let's mold the plaster and we can 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.330
 accommodate in this way if it is square 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 your recipient would have to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.660
 adjust it to the size of your container and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.400
 we are going to be measuring and what we go 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.800
 over the cardboard little girl the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.530
 we are cutting 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.530
 [Music] 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 very well since we had had the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.620
 Exact miles of cardboard strip 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.750
 let's start putting silicon in the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.440
 glass container so that you can 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.180
 paste the cardboard strip to the container and 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.360
 let's try to do it in a way 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.190
 in which the cardboard strip is very very 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.190
 tightly fitting to the glass container 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.840
 [Music] 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.140
 as you can see here on the screen such 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.910
 are the ornaments that I will be 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 using for my Christmas center 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.170
 open what I'm going to do is can 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.120
 cut the polytechnic that comes out of 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.730
 adornment because I will not serve 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.110
 nothing and that what I will be doing 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.110
 with the rest of flavor 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.160
 [Music] 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.150
 very well here and cut my ornaments 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.700
 Now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 I will stimulate as I want the ornaments 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.200
 as I'm not going to want to glued and I'm going to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 make sure I have enough 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.160
 ornaments to cover the crystal 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.520
 i 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.520
 [Music] 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.520
 and I start to stick my flowers and like 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.890
 can see I'm using quite 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.990
 silicon so that the flowers hold me 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.660
 the entire season that you are using the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.000
 metal center and it is also very 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.160
 important that we wait for the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.050
 silicone dry completely to start 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.130
 to do to start to paste the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.519
 next flower 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.519
 [Music] 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.490
 [Music] 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.800
 [Music] 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.220
 here it almost ends, nothing else 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.720
 stick the ribbon nothing else I will insure 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.650
 that all the flowers are very well 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.870
 fastened for the next step 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.810
 and the next step is to place the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.819
 very clear ribbon as it is a little too 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.430
 wide what I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.170
 fold and I'm going to stick it with silicon but 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.420
 you of preferences and have a 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.849
 It's going to be a lot thinner 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.189
 more favorable for you here I am 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.099
 putting the silicon on the cardboard strip 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:12.250
 to cover what are the sizes or 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.689
 roots of the flowers and that we are not going to 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 obviously also cover what is the 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.900
 cartonboard so that it does not look ugly and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.910
 see more as 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:39.810
 a Christmas aspect 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:39.810
 [Music] 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.749
 [Music] 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.920
 and 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.530
 [Music] 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.870
 finally I will place the candle in 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.390
 the center of the glass vessel I'm going 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.290
 to put a little bit of silicon and I'm going to 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:10.070
 try to stay in the center very very 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.070
 good to hold 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.129
 Now I'm going to turn on bulldozer 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.830
 how beautiful that right now I'm going to make a 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.599
 zoom so you can see it I hope it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.120
 encourage them to make girls really worth 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.819
 the penalty is very easy as they could see 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.340
 in the video and see what beautiful events 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.340
 I hope saluditos girl dare bye
