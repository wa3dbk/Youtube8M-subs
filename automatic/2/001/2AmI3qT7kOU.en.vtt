00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.810
 nine years in berlin and six years 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.740

 So see if he has first 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 has adulterations when he sees you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.550
 that the arc of one piece consists 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.280
 and of course the throw 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.670
 characteristics of a good bow 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 are included so if a fast 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690
 arrow throws 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 I started with the wood arch construction 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.940
 in southern Germany where I come from and 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.980
 had before nine years in Bogenbau 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.950
 course visited and the cultivation of the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.670
 wood to a traditional longbow 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.380
 that fascinated me a lot and that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.360
 I have as a hobby with to Berlin 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.280
 brought 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.070
 and then I had this hobby in 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.770
 Berlin made my career the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.810
 Difficulty at the beginning of the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.200
 Self-reliance was how do you know that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.660
 people know how to do advertising 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.120
 I step up and there I was at the beginning 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.100
 a lot on markets and show 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.290
 that 's just the gift bowing courses 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.500
 that you make courses in berlin bow building 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.500
 can 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.300
 Success is only when people are back 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.880
 so if the bulk of the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.590
 current customer comes through 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.209
 mouth-to-mouth propaganda so it de 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.709
 Talks around that there is me and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.640
 if I just notice that 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.800
 people come to me here 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.989
 arch us because they heard that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.260
 that there is me then it is for me 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.610
 a success 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.830
 Gerhard Wiedemann not only leads 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.780
 bow building courses but leads 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.580
 also interested in the art of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.580
 instinctive archery 1 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.190
 archery can also be in or 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.440
 takes place in different disciplines 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.750
 instead of that, there is a sport archery 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.690
 There are hunting archery with whole 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.910
 different floors for me 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.550
 It finds the traditional bow sport 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.550
 with the traditional wooden bow 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.300
 of course interesting and in that 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.970
 Connection meditation and archery 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.060
 yes, this concentration on your own 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.300
 Body on the movement on the breathing 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.130
 that what is bow to the 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.180
 wonderful to connect 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 and if there is every single component 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.540
 right movement breathing tension 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 relaxation then there is the possibility 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.390
 that the arrow finds its way into the target
