00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.929 
this and it look and it looks what looks
good<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:06.200> know<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.650> don't<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.549> see<00:02:07.820> the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
good you know I don't really see the

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.389 
good you know I don't really see the
difference<00:02:07.970> in<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.750> application<00:02:09.399> though

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
difference in the application though

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.949 
difference in the application though
obviously<00:02:10.549> if<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.000> use<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> stippling<00:02:11.750> brush

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
obviously if you use a stippling brush

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.870 
obviously if you use a stippling brush
and<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.650> effect<00:02:12.920> will<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.160> lot<00:02:13.489> lighter

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and the effect will be a lot lighter

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.690 
and the effect will be a lot lighter
like<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.390> coverage<00:02:14.660> wise

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
like the coverage wise

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.910 
like the coverage wise
in<00:02:15.760> terms<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.120> coverage<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:17.260> foundation

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
in terms of coverage the foundation

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.449 
in terms of coverage the foundation
isn't<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:19.800> wouldn't<00:02:20.800> say<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.099> medium

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
isn't I wouldn't say it's a medium

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.729 
isn't I wouldn't say it's a medium
coverage<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> light<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.569> medium<00:02:22.900> kind<00:02:23.560> of

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
coverage it's a light to medium kind of

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.500 
coverage it's a light to medium kind of
foundation<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:24.910> between<00:02:25.030> light<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
foundation so it's between light and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.170 
foundation so it's between light and
medium<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.519> build<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.849> up<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.090> your

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
medium but you can build it up to your

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.850 
medium but you can build it up to your
medium<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.050> think<00:02:29.260> that's<00:02:29.379> all<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.650> can

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
medium but I think that's all you can

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.619 
medium but I think that's all you can
get<00:02:29.980> without<00:02:30.280> getting<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> cakey<00:02:31.239> I'm<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.569> to

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.449 
get without getting a cakey I'm going to
recognize<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.470> promise<00:02:32.739> at<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> back<00:02:33.130> it

mind when I hear radiant glow is a dewy
effect<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.790> didn't<00:03:24.970> really<00:03:25.060> say<00:03:25.329> that

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
effect but it didn't really say that

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.420 
effect but it didn't really say that
it's<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.780> dewy<00:03:25.959> foundation<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.739> that's<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.190> my

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.630 
whatever the starter price and the
starter<00:06:03.180> price<00:06:03.390> so<00:06:03.750> it<00:06:04.740> was<00:06:05.010> relatively<00:06:05.550> cheap

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
starter price so it was relatively cheap

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.680 
starter price so it was relatively cheap
I<00:06:06.120> bought<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.450> for<00:06:07.160> $9.99<00:06:08.160> Australian<00:06:09.710> so<00:06:10.710> I

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
I bought it for $9.99 Australian so I

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.650 
I bought it for $9.99 Australian so I
know<00:06:12.690> foundations<00:06:13.590> here<00:06:13.800> regularly<00:06:14.330> go<00:06:15.330> for

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
know foundations here regularly go for

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.210 
know foundations here regularly go for
around<00:06:16.280> almost<00:06:17.280> $20<00:06:18.090> so<00:06:18.360> I<00:06:19.260> guess<00:06:19.980> that's<00:06:20.130> an

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
around almost $20 so I guess that's an

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.880 
around almost $20 so I guess that's an
OK<00:06:20.610> price<00:06:20.940> for<00:06:21.330> a<00:06:21.360> drugstore<00:06:21.810> foundation<00:06:22.620> but

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
OK price for a drugstore foundation but

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.980 
OK price for a drugstore foundation but

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
again I would not go out and bite again
