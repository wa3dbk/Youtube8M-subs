00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
fire usually shoots though blows up in

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.410 
fire usually shoots though blows up in
water<00:00:37.380> taking<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.879> surrounding

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
water taking out all the surrounding

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860 
water taking out all the surrounding
blocks<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.700> cool<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> works<00:00:42.570> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
blocks it's pretty cool and it works in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
blocks it's pretty cool and it works in
any<00:00:43.200> faction<00:00:43.739> server<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.760> actually

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
any faction server I can I'm actually

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
any faction server I can I'm actually
gonna<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> works<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.280> our

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
gonna show you how it works in our

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.779 
gonna show you how it works in our
server<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.450> another<00:00:49.379> video<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.670> we're

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
server in another video when we're

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
server in another video when we're
actually<00:00:50.940> rating<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> base<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.410> sure<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
actually rating a base so make sure to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.910 
actually rating a base so make sure to
check<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.399> out<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.870> wondering<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
check that out if you're wondering if it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.569 
check that out if you're wondering if it
works<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> servers<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.100> I'll<00:00:59.280> show<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
works and servers so here I'll show you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.800 
works and servers so here I'll show you
how<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.719> make<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:05.750> alright<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
how it how you make it now so alright so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
how it how you make it now so alright so
in<00:01:07.320> total<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.920> need<00:01:08.070> about<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.979> six

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in total you need about you need six

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
in total you need about you need six
repeaters<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:13.130> seven<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.979> here

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
repeaters here seven here to up here

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.640 
repeaters here seven here to up here
with<00:01:17.759> full<00:01:18.000> delay<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.380> delay<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
with full delay one little delay here

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
with full delay one little delay here
and<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:20.610> no<00:01:20.759> delay

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and one of two no delay

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
and one of two no delay
so<00:01:21.750> six<00:01:22.170> plus<00:01:22.470> seven<00:01:22.710> plus<00:01:22.920> four<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.759> need

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so six plus seven plus four you need

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
so six plus seven plus four you need
about<00:01:25.040> 17<00:01:26.040> repeaters<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.920> basically<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
about 17 repeaters and basically you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.340 
about 17 repeaters and basically you
just<00:01:30.530> place<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> button<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
just place a button here like this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
just place a button here like this
connected<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.890> redstone<00:01:35.130> while<00:01:36.259> you

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
connected up to one redstone while you

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
connected up to one redstone while you
have<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.369> gotta<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.850> four<00:01:39.570> blocks

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have it here it's gotta be four blocks

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
have it here it's gotta be four blocks
out<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.320> two<00:01:40.740> three<00:01:41.220> four<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> have

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
out one two three four so you have

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.840 
out one two three four so you have
enough<00:01:42.329> room<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.810> wire<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
enough room to wire it you put the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
enough room to wire it you put the
redstone<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.380> put

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
redstone all the way up to here put

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.889 
redstone all the way up to here put
seven<00:01:47.640> repeaters<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.540> no<00:01:48.840> delay<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.520> as

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
seven repeaters with no delay on it as

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.550 
seven repeaters with no delay on it as
you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.710> likes<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> TNT<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you can see and that likes the TNT and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.719 
you can see and that likes the TNT and
then<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.509> on<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:57.590> fourth<00:01:58.590> wire<00:01:59.280> we

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
then over here on our fourth wire we

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
then over here on our fourth wire we
have<00:01:59.880> six<00:02:00.420> repeaters<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.079> full<00:02:01.530> delay<00:02:01.829> one

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have six repeaters with full delay one

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
have six repeaters with full delay one
two<00:02:02.670> three<00:02:03.420> four<00:02:04.020> five<00:02:04.680> six<00:02:05.270> legs<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.540> going

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
two three four five six legs down going

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.309 
two three four five six legs down going
here<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.849> then<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.140> most

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
here and then this is one of the most

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.200 
here and then this is one of the most
confusing<00:02:10.739> parts<00:02:11.099> probably<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.819> me

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
confusing parts probably for me

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.300 
confusing parts probably for me
over<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:13.430> where<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:16.310> here

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
over here where you get like this here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.420 
over here where you get like this here
two<00:02:18.000> repeaters<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.990> full<00:02:19.230> delay<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.370> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
two repeaters with full delay and a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.630 
two repeaters with full delay and a
block<00:02:20.700> right<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.260> actually<00:02:22.920> where

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
block right here which is actually where

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.380 
block right here which is actually where
it<00:02:23.850> likes<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.390> TMT<00:02:25.730> because<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> piston<00:02:27.300> will

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it likes the TMT because the piston will

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.120 
it likes the TMT because the piston will
push<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> up<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.110> TMT<00:02:28.530> -<00:02:28.650> right<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
push it up for TMT - right there and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.940 
push it up for TMT - right there and
then<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.520> will<00:02:29.730> light<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.270> TMT

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
then this will light the TMT

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.980 
then this will light the TMT
so<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.490> comes<00:02:33.300> together<00:02:33.570> with<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
so and then it comes together with the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.170 
so and then it comes together with the
sand<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.410> Chooch<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.430> right<00:02:35.640> here<00:02:35.670> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
sand and Chooch and then right here you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.280 
sand and Chooch and then right here you
have<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:37.550> repeater<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:38.820> full<00:02:39.090> delay<00:02:39.450> comes

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
have a repeater with full delay comes

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.370 
have a repeater with full delay comes
over<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.160> activates<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.880> piston<00:02:42.380> with

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
over here this activates the piston with

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.490 
over here this activates the piston with
no<00:02:43.740> delay<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.460> that's<00:02:44.880> basically<00:02:45.470> how<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
no delay so that's basically how you

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.770 
no delay so that's basically how you
make<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.400> actually<00:02:47.760> incredibly<00:02:48.480> simple

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
make it it's actually incredibly simple

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
make it it's actually incredibly simple
and<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.490> wanna<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:52.380> first<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and if you wanna this first what you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.950 
and if you wanna this first what you
should<00:02:53.700> do<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:56.040> should<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:58.460> mounts<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.960> so

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
should do is you should a mounts and so

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960 
should do is you should a mounts and so
you<00:03:01.020> could<00:03:01.290> get<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> better<00:03:02.010> explosion<00:03:02.820> like

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you could get a better explosion like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.480 
you could get a better explosion like
this<00:03:03.210> watch<00:03:03.510> all<00:03:03.690> explain<00:03:07.100> don't<00:03:08.100> even<00:03:08.340> use

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
this watch all explain don't even use

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.730 
this watch all explain don't even use
TNT<00:03:08.970> yet<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.240> blow<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.910> find<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:14.630> shoot<00:03:15.740> -

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
TNT yet to blow in but find it shoot -

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.680 
TNT yet to blow in but find it shoot -
what<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.550> stacks<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.540> can

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
what you do is you stacks and so you can

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.190 
what you do is you stacks and so you can
get<00:03:18.810> an<00:03:19.320> explosion<00:03:19.800> like<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.400> here<00:03:21.140> instead<00:03:22.140> of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
get an explosion like up here instead of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.650 
get an explosion like up here instead of
an<00:03:22.590> explosion<00:03:23.250> down<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.760> after<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.300> say

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
an explosion down there so after you say

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.230 
an explosion down there so after you say
you<00:03:30.720> stack<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.350> about<00:03:31.770> five<00:03:32.720> sand<00:03:33.720> high<00:03:35.240> then

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
you stack it about five sand high then

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.330 
you stack it about five sand high then
you'll<00:03:36.480> actually<00:03:36.750> put<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.800> TNT<00:03:38.460> in<00:03:38.690> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
you'll actually put the TNT in and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.510 
you'll actually put the TNT in and
actually<00:03:41.340> blow<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.300 

see<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.210> TMT<00:03:48.650> explodes<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> higher

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
see the TMT explodes you get a higher

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.780 
see the TMT explodes you get a higher
explosion<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.560> that's<00:03:52.710> basically<00:03:53.280> how<00:03:53.640> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
explosion and that's basically how it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.440 
explosion and that's basically how it
works<00:03:53.820> guys<00:03:54.330> if<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.900> any<00:03:55.110> questions<00:03:55.620> um
