 for the installation is simple they will go 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.270
 to the folder that they have in my case I the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.670
 I passed this to one that I think we call 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.090
 by axis is good let's go find the 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.610
 mode usually appears in the week 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.740
 the download is good you are going to copy it or 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.100
 cut as you want and after that 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.890
 we are going to demand it follow next from 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.590
 route 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 the sd card 0 we go to android data 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.470
 with point rockstargames rate point and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.670
 here we stick it 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:56.500
 Read everything and overwrite 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 no that does not appear because in the grave 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 Well now we are going to see how they are 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.200
 muse 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.130
 for this they must keep this in mind 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.940
 that must be a root user and they need 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 the cards in any place that what 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.800
 find this one I'm going to leave 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 a link for the quilombos a video 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.220
 that since I saw it on the cards in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 spanish good now let's go see 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.250
 how is the mode that we just 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.250
 install 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 in aquesta j 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.200
 we go on the ones that the leads are going to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.500
 give the greeting down like it appeared 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.770
 one that I made transfer ndr we're going to give 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.270
 there 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.149
 but obviously when we have a 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 character exists or look for a car that 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.510
 like what is tourism 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.510
 It's cool 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.729
 and he looked for it 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 in another video I will teach how 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.180
 this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.580
 how to use the leads very well 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.580
 well really if we are in this video 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:23.230
 This is blue and you saw the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:27.640
 fingers the classes that the plugs the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:32.069
 tourism is tourism says let's go down 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.069
 this we go to the option that is transfused 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.060
 once it was like turning off the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.040
 screen and it's going to be put back but 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 obviously in the game we are going to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.150
 choose the color for example exterior 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.170
 color here and choose it 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:53.560
 black is and this contributes that I like 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.200
 that they do not charge 21 thousand 630 thousand 900 that 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.710
 It puts a lot of liter do not charge and I do not 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.300
 they come down 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.300
 let's eat the plugs 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.069
 the extra and the only ready 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.890
 what beauty 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.210
 I run very well how to operate as an asset 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.580
 in the nitro 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.340
 run you run like nonstop 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 why they wanted and hydraulic 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.740
 monkey make for the car to rise 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.860
 this is this there are many people 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.290
 the mix friends man asked that 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.520
 how this is used this part of the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.830
 dynamite 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.560
 they have told me a few regards that is used 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.150
 so I do not know what in a but this is 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.260
 use well 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.260
 because they are published 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.320
 this is used like this 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.299
 and so next to the other 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.569
 but the bad thing about this that can not 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.989
 sound the horn and the other 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.790
 and the other good way to have it cider 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.430
 the things then that you lose the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.400
 horn and tires and if so can 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.060
 have a vinci car of this that runs to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.330
 perfection very cool as well as this the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.610
 that I have to tourism 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.610
 and good looks very to fly 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.390
 to all of them love or good metal 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.320
 then from here you can go this does not 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.690
 to the 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.550
 to the mountains and so on but the bad thing about 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.010
 what if you hit a car and go 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.530
 at full speed as the water says 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.060
 there may be if a car is found on 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.600
 car that is over there of these the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.930
 airport 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.960
 let's make it from that I've done things that 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.420
 If you collide with one, the car is raised 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.800
 be the cei you turn and you have 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.530
 coincidentally they will explode to 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.319
