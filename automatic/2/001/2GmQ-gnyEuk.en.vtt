 Had 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.140
 I want to know more about old bikes to make better paper 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:30.880
 5 editorial staff sani woman is simply

 Note prefecture of the original gp rider ran through the Showa personally picture tea 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.310
 Honda, who is called a running laboratory and has brought its technological capabilities to the world, has challenged what challenges

 Large Insects Delivers Onda's Racer Development 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:55.310
 If the race is true, for example, 10 chappers in Ruray will be great 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.329
 Was it absolutely ace found in developing junior high school 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.670
 Well not me minutes 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 Is it doing to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 Leakage because even race to make anyway new ones fun 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:13.390
 And of course comfort women tile also say Toka made Why work early on and lock 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:28.490
 The piston is getting messy, and when the rotation gets rough, there are many soon

 More and more related ik あ っ セ ン タ ー セ ン タ ー セ ン タ ー center center route 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:39.230
 A little in the points only once: I mean you put out a number of times per minute as once what horsepower 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:46.220
 I just rotation rises 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:53.470
 Honda has repeatedly repeated technological innovations, such as cutting and dropping engines in order to create public communication 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.030
 The book did not stop the development process in order to realize the slogan of a running laboratory 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.479
 Every year the engine is different 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 Every year people like myself and if there are 4 cylinders then cheese also goes along the way 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:14.670
 The tin dinosaur which thinks that the change to the specification is 6 aircraft 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.270
 That's really all kinds of megane. 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 If you switch on the way, there is no bed and breakfast 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.240
 Ro' Maeda say there was a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.840
 It is amazing covering it the Atamagaa 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.400
 The team who developed a stronger engine wins 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.769
 That was the equation of victory at that time 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.769
 However, the equation started to collapse around the late 60's 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.609
 Just to this this this 60-year come the Grand Prix by one of the last Te Maikuhei Rudo' 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.439
 There is a great present person 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:53.469
 At the end of the generation I'm sorry everyone knees open a little 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.469
 Hmm 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:18.650
 here are buy marker spring high really begin to win 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:23.180
 Say that put the most deeply power from absolute Te of that bent the curve was already rising 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:27.200
 I've been more and more fat say when the metabolism or changed to from a place called 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.380
 Herbs are important but there is no straight line but a demo car 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:37.350
 Measurements also got more and more getting the curve even roughly that seed 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:43.260
 In the past it was common for the team with the fastest straight to win the game 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.160
 From the late 60's, it was gradually changed to a race where cornering divided the outcome 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.670
 It is 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.670
 The flow naturally influenced the development of the racer 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:09.860
 How do you make more boosy so that you can get rid of that corner quickly r? 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:15.830
 That bike mall yangdong

 Professional do not run faster Tara scared Datte rider of the original human rights 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.510
 I'm coming I ahead carried out not even whether goo that can be peace of mind because not strong last even it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:31.700
 Because I don't think it's okay here 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:35.820
 It 's a little more aggressive than trying to use the entrance 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.060
 You can be trusted, but the characteristics have changed 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.080
 I will 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:48.900
 An engine park that can be run with confidence from engines that are difficult to handle 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.259
 Not only riders get on the machine but also direction from the machine 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.240
 What 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.240
 The development stance has changed 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.660
 Sky and human being become one 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.660
 That has become a major theme of racer development 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.850
 There are a lot of more interesting types to say new 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:15.780
 Well, it's a bit of Honda's process 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.780
 Sound and sound engine pensentio a little yes
