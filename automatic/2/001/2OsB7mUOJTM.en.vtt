00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and I kind of did this before radio on

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.940 
and I kind of did this before radio on
my<00:02:53.519> super<00:02:53.850> deer<00:02:53.970> farm<00:02:54.180> Cuba<00:02:54.480> Lee<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.950> initially

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
my super deer farm Cuba Lee I initially

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.360 
my super deer farm Cuba Lee I initially
use<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.640> particular<00:02:56.880> one<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.800> deltas<00:02:59.190> arm

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
use this particular one the deltas arm

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.520 
use this particular one the deltas arm
code<00:02:59.610> Sparkle<00:03:00.239> glaze<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.170> one<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
code Sparkle glaze but this one is a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.820 
code Sparkle glaze but this one is a
bigger<00:03:02.160> chunks<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.019> think<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:04.680> works

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
bigger chunks and I think this one works

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.090 
bigger chunks and I think this one works
for<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.160> super<00:03:05.970> neat<00:03:06.120> form<00:03:06.769> wearing<00:03:07.769> appears

grade<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.920> go<00:03:11.069> something<00:03:11.970> smaller<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
grade I have to go something smaller and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.170 
grade I have to go something smaller and
actually<00:03:12.989> find<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.319> this<00:03:13.500> interesting

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180
