I<00:05:20.160> made

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:25.019 

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:30.749 

quite<00:05:26.759> a<00:05:27.759> bit<00:05:28.359> solar<00:05:29.139> observatories<00:05:29.949> it's

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
quite a bit solar observatories it's

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:35.069 
quite a bit solar observatories it's
really<00:05:31.209> bouncy<00:05:31.479> yet<00:05:32.349> very<00:05:32.679> bouncy<00:05:33.129> I<00:05:34.079> and

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:35.079 
really bouncy yet very bouncy I and

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.260 
really bouncy yet very bouncy I and
probably<00:05:36.119> Silicon<00:05:37.119> Valley

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
probably Silicon Valley

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:48.170 
probably Silicon Valley
and<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:40.440> think<00:05:42.919> it<00:05:45.110> took<00:05:46.110> hard<00:05:46.530> work<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.460> yeah

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
and I think it took hard work for a yeah

00:05:48.180 --> 00:06:00.290 
and I think it took hard work for a yeah
what's<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.199> word<00:05:49.460> yeah<00:05:50.460> that's<00:05:53.389> alright

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.840 

and<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.600> think<00:06:01.690> it's<00:06:02.020> quite<00:06:02.169> bouncing<00:06:03.010> and<00:06:03.310> the

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
and I think it's quite bouncing and the

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.740 
and I think it's quite bouncing and the
cheesiness<00:06:04.419> in<00:06:04.750> some<00:06:04.900> places<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.500> song<00:06:05.710> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
cheesiness in some places of the song so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.939 
cheesiness in some places of the song so
what<00:06:07.750> does<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:07.960> make<00:06:08.080> you<00:06:08.139> feel<00:06:08.260> when<00:06:08.470> you<00:06:08.800> just
