over a year were forty seven dollars I

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.470 
over a year were forty seven dollars I
think<00:00:24.830> they<00:00:24.950> had<00:00:25.040> to<00:00:25.070> devise<00:00:25.460> ways<00:00:25.490> to

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
think they had to devise ways to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.330 
think they had to devise ways to
demonstrate<00:00:26.830> change<00:00:28.150> fast<00:00:29.150> I<00:00:30.250> went<00:00:31.250> to

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
demonstrate change fast I went to

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.889 
demonstrate change fast I went to
architecture<00:00:31.610> school<00:00:31.940> in<00:00:32.300> University<00:00:32.809> of

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
architecture school in University of

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.869 
architecture school in University of
Cincinnati<00:00:33.379> took<00:00:34.010> all<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.370> architectural

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
Cincinnati took all the architectural

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.779 
Cincinnati took all the architectural
courses<00:00:35.300> got<00:00:35.510> my<00:00:35.690> degree<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:37.219> began<00:00:37.519> right

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
courses got my degree and I began right

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.139 
courses got my degree and I began right
then<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.929> think<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:39.730> architecture<00:00:40.730> was

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
then to think that architecture was

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.319 
then to think that architecture was
worthless<00:00:42.460> just<00:00:43.460> because<00:00:43.789> you're<00:00:43.909> hooked<00:00:44.120> up

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
worthless just because you're hooked up

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.479 
worthless just because you're hooked up
to<00:00:44.390> a<00:00:44.569> municipal<00:00:45.170> water<00:00:45.350> system<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.249> power

to a municipal water system and a power

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.520 
to a municipal water system and a power
system<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.480> doesn't<00:00:47.749> mean<00:00:48.019> that<00:00:48.170> those<00:00:48.319> things

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
system it doesn't mean that those things

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.149 
system it doesn't mean that those things
are<00:00:48.679> always<00:00:48.800> going<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.069> be<00:00:49.219> there<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:51.159> would
