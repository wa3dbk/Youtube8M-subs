00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.010
 end of a song I participate or not 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 and then I'm sorry I'm pissed 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.859
 same amount too I assume I have not 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 started very well the day I'm at 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.170
 arrival in Switzerland 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 I leave the station I got confused 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500
 with a guy who had the syndrome 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.460
 Gilles de la tourette 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.460
 in fact it's just in French 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.700
 the songs more and more here I 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.780
 am I like doing a song for 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.860
 the shot because it's true that at the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.060
 base me that was what I wanted to do 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.540
 really I throw myself singer in a 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.810
 group 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.800
 because that 's what's really 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.880
 because comic really it's from the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.610
 shit we will not lie to each other 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.140
 oh yes no it's bad because we're good 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 to talk to each other frankly I just want to 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.160
 banging chicks on it is the heart that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.620
 you really talk there it's true all 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.660
 it really is and it does not work the side 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.580
 so his two goals and a beaver in a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.640
 karting and after they make a ride in 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.930
 asia continues from mexico not walk 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.640
 too much no more it's cooler you see 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.570
 even for the drag actually changes it 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.250
 all because it's true that as soon as you 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 have an instrument really there is a trick 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.160
 is happening everyone I noticed 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.330
 this delirium there was a beach there 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.470
 four girls who are in circles who 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.660
 look at guys in the distance and who are 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.410
 there we saw you from the rabbit you saw he has 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.410
 seen at loll what is ugly to 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.800
 say a gremlin not the guy looks 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.800
 facts 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.410
 in response to 12 months do me tbb comes 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 steal my friend this trail to the minstrel 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.910
 distant waltz for you well amazing 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.260
 good after it does not work and that all 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.570
 musical instruments of course the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.979
 it's more complicated to flirt with 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.940
 people with a triangle for example 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.290
 no, but wait for this is something I 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.729
 have always wondered how you do 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.250
 to become a triangle player 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.570
 professionals are only one note and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.090
 ask what for an exam to have 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.410
 arms what's the name but it's 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.940
 really scary because if we 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 consider the triangle as the intro 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.440
 music means that there are 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.430
 triangle teachers that means 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.450
 that there are guys coming who are 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.060
 there hello sir 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.060
 go there sit first lesson 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:39.530
 it's up to you ok here I've taught you 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.530
 everything I knew
