00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello and special hello 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.470
 Regular viewers of my channel thanks 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 Great look at me today 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.259
 talk again in g b the thing is that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.780
 I am often asked by guys how 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.609
 changing motor power when moving to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.380
 gas falls flying acceleration well and so on and 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.930
 stand of some kind for measuring power 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.770
 motor 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.590
 I do not have I do not want to resort to this 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.140
 just measuring the acceleration of the car to a hundred 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.620
 twenty kilometers per hour we measure this 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.030
 conversation on gasoline measured on the gas and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.580
 let's see how these will be different 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.610
 why numbers up to 120 I will not give but because 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.410
 that way we will accelerate longer by 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.330
 time and the longer 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.300
 I think this is a temporary topic. 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.390
 less will be the measurement error well and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.000
 the more accurate the numbers will be more than 120 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.710
 I had thoughts there to 150 accelerate 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.910
 well, the motor is 12 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.190
 so for too long it will be a song and 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.880
 meaning i don't see i'm not a racer and so 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.390
 the readings were more accurate I will follow 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.310
 certain algorithm acceleration sneakers in 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.660
 floor 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.899
 shifting to top gear as 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.320
 only tachometer comes to 5000 and so 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.680
 so we start on gasoline windows 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 closed air conditioning all ventilation 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.920
 turned off 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.430
 overclocking will be long but still 3 2 1 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.430
 start 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.409
 we are going 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.229
 fear 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.049
 stay 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.250
 approximately from the same place 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:09.890
 same conditions 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.890
 start on gas 321 stop 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.310
 1 day 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.590
 acceleration is slow 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 Stop 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.910
 120 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 Feels like I can not say can 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.709
 well be a little bit a little bit slower 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.709
 than gasoline 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.910
 Now specially measured for those who 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.459
 little volumetric engine who thinks 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.190
 put gas on it to compare 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.620
 could understand how to lose your 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.930
 engine power now i will 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.040
 accelerate on gasoline included 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 air conditioned and so drove 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.930
 petrol included missionary included 3 2 1. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.380
 Stop 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.570
 120 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.780
 so it remains only to take stock 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.090
 Of course these numbers are absolutely not exactly 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920
 would you call but some big picture 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.790
 draw out and that 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.190
 skoda fabia 1 2 3 cylinder 69 horse 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.520
 forces up to one hundred twenty kilometers per hour in 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.760
 average rides in 23 seconds on petrol 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.650
 gas these 120 kilometers occupy 24.7 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.580
 seconds is somewhere a little more than seven 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.120
 percent 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.310
 longer on gasoline with the included 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.650
 air-conditioned car rides practically 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.930
 as well as on gas the difference is three 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.359
 the tenth of a second is 24.4 seconds by others 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.150
 words if you want to set yourself 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.490
 gebul then the transition to your gas 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.530
 the engine will feel exactly 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.350
 also as if you turned on 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 air conditioning on gasoline but there is one 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.170
 but before the measurements, I was more 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.870
 than one hundred percent sure that faster 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.860
 total car will go to the second gasoline 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.720
 the place is not particularly behind the gas will show and 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.610
 the third place will be with a large margin 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.600
 gasoline acceleration included 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.360
 air conditioning in numbers car on 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.430
 gasoline with air conditioning even faster 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.620
 I went than at Easter, well, if not by a little 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.130
 but by three tenths of a second 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.310
 how did it happen when you turn it on 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.560
 the air conditioner feels lost 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.090
 power well two to three times more than 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.860
 just switching it to gas clue in 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.660
 different engine operating modes 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.880
 after all when I did this measurement to one hundred 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.000
 twenty kilometers per hour then the engine 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.460
 I had to turn 3 somewhere up to 5000 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.940
 turns and survive with him all he 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.030
 can 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.990
 and this is a slightly different mode than you 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.000
 do you usually ride everyday 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.070
 motor you turn thousands there and a half to 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.230
 three three and a half thousand and not 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.660
 squeeze all the juices off him 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.270
 words if you like to drive love 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.550
 fast driving on the highway 120 kilometers and 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.810
 and higher frequent overtaking 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.360
 then of course you will notice a fall 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.380
 gas power and if you're calm 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.570
 drivers in life as I let you then 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.600
 hardly notice this loss 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.240
 power when switching to gas on this 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.490
 Thanks for watching me. Come in. 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.270
 on my channel watch other videos and 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.270
 until
