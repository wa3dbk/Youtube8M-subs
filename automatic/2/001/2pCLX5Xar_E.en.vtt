show how easy it is to install David's
kit<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.000> hid<00:00:09.450> conversion<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.410> 23

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
kit for the hid conversion for the 23

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.369 
kit for the hid conversion for the 23
what<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.870> half<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
what we have here this is one half of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.890 
what we have here this is one half of
the<00:00:16.440> system<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.010> ballast<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.020> where<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
the system of ballast this is where a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
the system of ballast this is where a
bulb<00:00:21.900> plugs<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.560> right<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:24.119> I'm

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
bulb plugs in right here and I'm

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.700 
bulb plugs in right here and I'm
actually<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> doing<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.350> backwards

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
actually kind of doing this backwards

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
actually kind of doing this backwards
you<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.880> system<00:00:27.359> set<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.900> had

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you already have my system set up I had

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.529 
you already have my system set up I had
to<00:00:28.170> redo<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> video<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:30.000> anyways<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
to redo the video but anyways this is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
to redo the video but anyways this is
what<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> bulb<00:00:31.109> looks<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.640> goes<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
what the bulb looks like and it goes in

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.250 
what the bulb looks like and it goes in
in<00:00:33.570> place<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> regular<00:00:34.469> h1<00:00:35.690> bulbs<00:00:36.690> set<00:00:37.110> up

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
in place of the regular h1 bulbs set up

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.500 
in place of the regular h1 bulbs set up
this<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.700> simple<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> ballast

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is very simple this is the ballast

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
this is very simple this is the ballast
okay<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.710> I'll<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
okay and what I'll have to do is is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.959 
okay and what I'll have to do is is
mount<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> ballast<00:00:45.780> later<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.520> but<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.400 

these<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> trigger<00:00:54.539> wires<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
these are the trigger wires I have it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
these are the trigger wires I have it
separated<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.510> go<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.050> side<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
separated to go from one side to the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
separated to go from one side to the
other<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> trigger<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
other but this is a trigger for the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.920 
other but this is a trigger for the
driver's<00:01:00.449> side<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.379> plugs<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
driver's side this plugs into the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
driver's side this plugs into the
regular<00:01:04.129> socket<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:07.159> where<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
regular socket for the where the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
regular socket for the where the
headlights<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> white

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
headlights and you want to put the white

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.960 
headlights and you want to put the white
wire<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> yellow<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> plug<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.970> then

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
wire to the yellow in the plug and then

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.560 
wire to the yellow in the plug and then
the<00:01:15.060> black<00:01:15.270> wire<00:01:15.509> goes<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> ground<00:01:17.390> okay<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the black wire goes to ground okay that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
the black wire goes to ground okay that
takes<00:01:18.780> care<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.210> ahead<00:01:21.330> and
