00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.880
 good everyone here they see again a 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.750
 occlusion demo and now we're in a 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.480
 that are blocks in or as pronounced 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.250
 it's a demo different from what I recorded 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.779
 so far it is not a game as such 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.119
 but simply one in addition to what 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.520
 what it is to immerse yourself in a world of real 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.950
 virtual completely simulates being 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.790
 sitting in a chair without misunderstandings and and 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.650
 look around 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.040
 you see that there is, for example, a 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.989
 Figure tetris screen not 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.559
 note but it looks surprisingly 3d and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.949
 inside that TV here we have a TV 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.140
 plus a cardboard game boy a phone 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.449
 of cardboard an unknown instrument 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.120
 cardboard a piece of tetris that is 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.800
 being built in process even 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.660
 has a plane under the lamp 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 he also throws me a little bit all this has 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.519
 an aesthetic of cartoon very well 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.489
 made of pixar or even a game tale 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.590
 daily game as how is walking 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.290
 dead is not an ancient mouse a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.850
 super dirty keyboard and I think this demo 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 it's the best you can teach some 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.480
 friend if you have locus ridge here is the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 mouse by the way if I noticed a little 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.140
 there if you have a plus list 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 The best you can teach a friend 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.450
 how you look at this is the most leaf 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.299
 it's quite shocking and see there the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.920
 pipe that rare all drawers 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.509
 conveys a lot the feeling of 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.399
 be here within this this demo as 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.049
 No one I think conveys the feeling of 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.789
 to be inside those a harness looks like a 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.549
 Danish 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.140
 Uruguay but yes and if we turn around we will see 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.550
 a window with tetris locks 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 giants falling 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.170
 incredible behind because there are more things that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.880
 however they are much weaker 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.240
 this is amazing we can not move 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 no matter how much we press the gloomy 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.549
 tepic to this russian train biffle go but 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.310
 if we throw a lot to us that is by 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.770
 much that we press buttons we can not 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 move though this conveys very 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.569
 well the feeling of being in a world 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.400
 alternative and I think it shows a lot 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.530
 capabilities of one who requests it so 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.989
 if you have a do not hesitate to go down to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.550
 this demo and try it because it's amazing 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.150
 the feeling of sitting here 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.660
 looking around and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.120
 living things happening is pretty good 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.010
