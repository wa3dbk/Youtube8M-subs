00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.720
 Revered in many countries, 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.040
 football is today a global sport, 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.840
 where governments and supporters 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.640
 display national pride and patriotism. 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.560
 In the eyes of many young people, 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.700
 the heroes of the round ball embody a true model of success, 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 and an example to follow. 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.940
 But as you will discover, 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.540
 it was not always so. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960
 In medieval England, 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.240
 the ball game did not have strict rules. 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.040
 No limit was set on the number of players, 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.860
 all the blows were allowed, 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 and the streets of the cities were systematically transformed 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 in real battlefield 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 where destruction, serious injury and death were commonplace. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.480
 In London, the parties became so chaotic 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.420
 that artisans and merchants asked King Edward II to put an end to it. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.080
 In response, the latter declared outlaw this dangerous game 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.740
 and threatened anyone who would touch a bullet again. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.500
 But this decision had the effect of a wet firecracker, 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.200
 and the craze for football continued to grow. 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.140
 Soon he turned men away from compulsory service, 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.100
 vital to the defense of the kingdom: 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.140
 the practice of the war arc. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480
 After all, why shoot arrows at inert targets, 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.380
 when we can draw some good potatoes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 in the face of his colleagues? 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.180
 Upset, the king banished then 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.300
 purely and simply football of England. 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.580
 His successor will not return to this decision. 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.300
 Proof that football then became for the whole country 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 not only a real passion, 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620
 but also a national security problem. 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.040
 But nothing works, and the power, again ignored, 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.500
 will have to tighten the laws in force. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 At present, any troublemaker player 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.080
 would end up chained to shackles and humiliated in a public place. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.160
 Fines or prison sentences would punish others. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.400
 In the middle of the 18th century, 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.780
 England promulgated a new law on the ownership of the land. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 Consequence, open land 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 - and so used by the community to play - 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.880
 passed to private use. 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.220
 The enthusiasts therefore had no other choice 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.180
 than to fall back on the only remaining public space: 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.060
 the street. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.900
 It's only a century later 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.580
 that the British government finally reached the goal: 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.480
 by prohibiting, by way of fines, 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.660
 the practice of the ball on the public road. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.020
 From now on, the players had to go on a ground reserved for this sport, 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.140
 who was finally recognized as such. 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.900
