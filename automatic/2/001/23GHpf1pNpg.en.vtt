00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
gate now yeah think about negate though

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.720 
gate now yeah think about negate though
is<00:00:58.090> we<00:00:58.290> we<00:00:59.290> like<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.559> tap<00:01:00.040> out<00:01:00.219> in<00:01:00.370> this<00:01:00.489> deck

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
is we we like to tap out in this deck

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.750 
is we we like to tap out in this deck
like<00:01:01.000> every<00:01:01.269> turn<00:01:01.510> sure<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:03.160> not<00:01:03.339> as<00:01:03.550> good

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
like every turn sure so it's not as good

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.910 
like every turn sure so it's not as good
as<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.030> could<00:01:04.180> be<00:01:04.560> trespassing<00:01:05.560> sole<00:01:05.710> leader

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
as it could be trespassing sole leader

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.149 
as it could be trespassing sole leader
now<00:01:06.130> work<00:01:06.280> by<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.690> um<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.740> even<00:01:08.920> bother

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
now work by that um do we even bother

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.060 
now work by that um do we even bother
looting<00:01:09.550> or<00:01:09.729> do<00:01:09.850> we<00:01:09.940> just<00:01:09.970> attack<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.890> just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
looting or do we just attack you just

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
looting or do we just attack you just
attack<00:01:12.369> I<00:01:12.520> think<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:12.729> just<00:01:12.759> need<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.000> get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
attack I think we just need to get

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.330 
attack I think we just need to get
points<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.780> don't<00:01:14.530> think<00:01:14.590> because<00:01:14.979> we<00:01:15.100> can't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
points in I don't think because we can't

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.800 
points in I don't think because we can't
go<00:01:15.460> off<00:01:15.610> as<00:01:15.820> long<00:01:15.940> as<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.119> spell<00:01:16.360> bomb<00:01:16.509> is<00:01:16.659> here

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
go off as long as the spell bomb is here

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.330 
go off as long as the spell bomb is here
so<00:01:17.049> yeah<00:01:17.229> our<00:01:17.470> strategies<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> little<00:01:18.100> bit<00:01:18.190> till

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
so yeah our strategies a little bit till

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.620 
so yeah our strategies a little bit till
it<00:01:18.460> changed<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.790> little<00:01:18.880> bit<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.119> I<00:01:19.180> just<00:01:19.360> attack

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
it changed a little bit so I just attack

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.060 
it changed a little bit so I just attack
drop<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.040> trespassing<00:01:21.700> thing<00:01:21.909> yep<00:01:23.070> such

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
drop this the trespassing thing yep such

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
drop this the trespassing thing yep such
as<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.280> like<00:01:24.570> leaving<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.690> out<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:26.020> negate

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
as I like leaving that out for negate

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.260 
as I like leaving that out for negate
yeah<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.830> mean<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.580> cäcilie<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.119> an

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
yeah I mean he could cäcilie on an

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.410 
yeah I mean he could cäcilie on an
extern<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:34.400> all<00:01:35.400> right

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
extern about it all right

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.910 
extern about it all right
I<00:01:37.479> guess<00:01:38.140> we<00:01:38.290> could<00:01:38.409> have<00:01:38.530> brought<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.799> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
I guess we could have brought in the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.950 
I guess we could have brought in the
mental<00:01:39.159> missteps<00:01:39.520> but<00:01:39.909> even<00:01:40.450> then<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:40.810> this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
mental missteps but even then if this

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.120 
mental missteps but even then if this
negate<00:01:41.259> was<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.409> mental<00:01:41.650> miss<00:01:41.799> that<00:01:41.950> but<00:01:42.040> would

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
negate was a mental miss that but would

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.359 
negate was a mental miss that but would
have<00:01:42.220> been<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> turn<00:01:42.580> too<00:01:42.729> late<00:01:44.159> liliana<00:01:45.159> that's

necrotic ooze which he probably does

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.929

waiting<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> use<00:03:37.470> post-mortem<00:03:38.470> are<00:03:38.769> now<00:03:39.430> do<00:03:39.489> we

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
waiting to use post-mortem are now do we

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.030

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
go for the beads to be honest the doom

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.520 
go for the beads to be honest the doom
blade<00:03:46.239> can't<00:03:46.569> kill<00:03:46.720> necrotic<00:03:47.019> ooze<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.470> we

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
blade can't kill necrotic ooze so we

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.990 
blade can't kill necrotic ooze so we
have<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.680> decent<00:03:47.920> chance<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:48.639> pointing

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
have a decent chance of just pointing

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.130 
have a decent chance of just pointing
with<00:03:49.150> beating<00:03:49.659> him<00:03:49.750> down

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.750 
well unless he gets back knee heal spell
bomb<00:06:19.110> but<00:06:19.890> even<00:06:19.980> then<00:06:20.190> we<00:06:20.280> just<00:06:20.400> attacked<00:06:20.670> with

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
bomb but even then we just attacked with

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.100 
bomb but even then we just attacked with
everyone<00:06:21.090> can't<00:06:21.810> kill<00:06:22.020> them<00:06:22.140> all<00:06:23.900> living<00:06:24.900> ring

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
everyone can't kill them all living ring

and with everyone okay good so yeah
seems<00:07:05.690> good<00:07:06.110> so<00:07:07.060> he<00:07:08.060> kind<00:07:08.600> of<00:07:08.690> got<00:07:08.840> a<00:07:09.110> little<00:07:10.480> he

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
seems good so he kind of got a little he

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.790 
seems good so he kind of got a little he
was<00:07:11.600> off<00:07:11.720> to<00:07:11.810> a<00:07:11.840> little<00:07:12.050> rough<00:07:12.230> start<00:07:12.590> there

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
was off to a little rough start there

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.850 
was off to a little rough start there
but<00:07:13.810> see<00:07:14.810> I'd<00:07:14.900> like<00:07:15.020> to<00:07:15.140> bring<00:07:15.320> in<00:07:15.470> the<00:07:15.560> mental

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
but see I'd like to bring in the mental

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.600 
but see I'd like to bring in the mental
missteps<00:07:17.800> yeah<00:07:18.800> but<00:07:19.010> again<00:07:19.310> like<00:07:19.460> I<00:07:19.580> said

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
missteps yeah but again like I said

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.130 
missteps yeah but again like I said
negate<00:07:20.120> would<00:07:20.450> be<00:07:20.540> better<00:07:20.660> for<00:07:20.780> that<00:07:21.020> because

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
negate would be better for that because

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.340 
negate would be better for that because
they<00:07:22.060> said<00:07:23.060> if<00:07:23.150> you<00:07:23.240> die<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.870> reason<00:07:24.170> I<00:07:24.230> want

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
they said if you die the reason I want

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.450 
they said if you die the reason I want
to<00:07:24.410> bring<00:07:24.500> a<00:07:24.590> mental<00:07:24.830> messed<00:07:24.980> up<00:07:25.100> is<00:07:25.220> if<00:07:25.370> he

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
to bring a mental messed up is if he

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.830 
to bring a mental messed up is if he
plays<00:07:25.640> it<00:07:25.790> turn<00:07:25.940> 1<00:07:26.180> then<00:07:26.450> we<00:07:26.540> can<00:07:26.660> still

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 
plays it turn 1 then we can still

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.200 
plays it turn 1 then we can still
counter<00:07:27.220> weights<00:07:28.220> are<00:07:28.340> 12<00:07:28.610> mental<00:07:28.880> missteps

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
counter weights are 12 mental missteps

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.290 
counter weights are 12 mental missteps
in<00:07:29.450> to<00:07:30.200> negate<00:07:31.240> that's<00:07:32.240> a<00:07:32.330> good<00:07:32.480> idea<00:07:32.570> I<00:07:33.280> mean

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
in to negate that's a good idea I mean

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.750 
in to negate that's a good idea I mean
maybe<00:07:35.300> I<00:07:35.900> just<00:07:36.470> like<00:07:36.620> the<00:07:36.740> gates<00:07:37.250> because<00:07:37.460> it's

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
maybe I just like the gates because it's

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.850 
maybe I just like the gates because it's
it's<00:07:38.510> guaranteed<00:07:39.080> could<00:07:39.350> use<00:07:39.470> out<00:07:39.560> anything

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860 
it's guaranteed could use out anything

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.370 
it's guaranteed could use out anything
but<00:07:39.890> creatures<00:07:40.370> and<00:07:41.020> maybe<00:07:42.020> we<00:07:42.140> should<00:07:42.290> take

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
but creatures and maybe we should take

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.900 
but creatures and maybe we should take
out<00:07:42.530> the<00:07:42.620> cage<00:07:42.860> breakers<00:07:43.310> for<00:07:43.580> mentalness

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:43.910 
out the cage breakers for mentalness

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.600 
out the cage breakers for mentalness
steps<00:07:44.240> because<00:07:44.920> but<00:07:45.920> if<00:07:46.010> we<00:07:46.040> post<00:07:46.340> mortem

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
steps because but if we post mortem

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.160 
steps because but if we post mortem
lunch<00:07:46.790> in<00:07:47.000> response<00:07:47.420> he<00:07:47.540> just<00:07:47.810> exile<00:07:48.140> our

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.170 
lunch in response he just exile our

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.480 
lunch in response he just exile our
graveyard<00:07:48.680> then<00:07:48.770> we<00:07:48.890> don't<00:07:49.070> get<00:07:49.190> the<00:07:49.280> kiss<00:07:49.460> of

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490 
graveyard then we don't get the kiss of

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.070 
graveyard then we don't get the kiss of
cage<00:07:49.790> Baker's<00:07:50.180> at<00:07:50.330> all<00:07:50.480> yeah<00:07:50.810> but<00:07:52.270> yeah<00:07:53.270> yeah

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 
cage Baker's at all yeah but yeah yeah

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.200 
cage Baker's at all yeah but yeah yeah
yeah<00:07:54.710> it's<00:07:54.890> fine<00:07:55.040> because<00:07:55.100> I<00:07:55.280> mean<00:07:55.430> if<00:07:55.550> if<00:07:56.030> we

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.210 
yeah it's fine because I mean if if we

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.580 
yeah it's fine because I mean if if we
can<00:07:56.360> mental<00:07:56.690> misstep<00:07:56.960> isn't<00:07:57.200> Hetal<00:07:57.410> spell

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:57.590 
can mental misstep isn't Hetal spell

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.980 
can mental misstep isn't Hetal spell
bomb<00:07:57.740> that<00:07:57.920> we<00:07:57.980> don't<00:07:58.130> have<00:07:58.220> to<00:07:58.280> worry<00:07:58.460> about

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:58.990 
bomb that we don't have to worry about

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.970 
bomb that we don't have to worry about
graveyard<00:07:59.990> stuff<00:08:00.170> when<00:08:00.290> we<00:08:00.320> can<00:08:00.530> bust<00:08:00.680> out<00:08:00.830> the

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:00.980 
graveyard stuff when we can bust out the

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.320 
graveyard stuff when we can bust out the
combo<00:08:01.370> so<00:08:01.550> yeah<00:08:01.670> I<00:08:01.730> think<00:08:01.760> that<00:08:02.060> might<00:08:02.180> be<00:08:02.210> a

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.330 
combo so yeah I think that might be a

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.700 
combo so yeah I think that might be a
good<00:08:02.450> trade<00:08:02.750> yeah<00:08:02.960> I<00:08:03.020> think<00:08:03.230> we'll<00:08:03.320> take<00:08:03.500> out

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:03.710 
good trade yeah I think we'll take out

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.450 
good trade yeah I think we'll take out
cage<00:08:04.130> breakers<00:08:04.730> and<00:08:05.500> bring<00:08:06.500> in<00:08:06.710> three<00:08:07.100> mental

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:07.460 
cage breakers and bring in three mental

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.110 
cage breakers and bring in three mental
missteps<00:08:07.940> that<00:08:08.590> seem<00:08:09.590> good<00:08:09.740> yeah<00:08:10.100> all<00:08:11.000> right

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 
missteps that seem good yeah all right

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.360 
missteps that seem good yeah all right
me<00:08:11.690> well<00:08:12.170> we're<00:08:12.440> still<00:08:12.560> testing<00:08:12.710> this<00:08:12.950> deck<00:08:13.160> so

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.370 
me well we're still testing this deck so

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.970 
me well we're still testing this deck so
let's<00:08:13.610> see<00:08:13.730> how<00:08:13.760> it<00:08:13.850> goes
