00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.569
 woerth 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 k1 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.419
 the world 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.419
 when it's over 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.679
 and it started again 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.199
 again and again 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199
 it must start again 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.400
 i love to live in miami 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.810
 I loved to draw 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.690
 for his return to the hemicycle 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 what I prefer 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.380
 perhaps 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 but tonight it's a new challenge I'm going to suffer 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 as we see in the distance 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.150
 last month same leader yellow jersey 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 m this one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.380
 what 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 Why 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.780
 we are now it's exactly what you say is wrong 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 so far you want you to use 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 and as you go 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 the 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 you can here 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.169
 next g20 meeting in london on thursday 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.429
 I am surprised 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.429
 but there was the look of alain weisz men 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 if we remember that I know 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 it took me some time to clean up the season 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.589
 he had been buried for six months 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.589
 I had to take this kind occurs 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.419
 I change that it was the people 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.550
 no 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.779
 public libraries if I tell you 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:20.009
 trials tight budget but it becomes difficult, sir 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.129
 November you will quickly find yourself at the boss 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.189
 when we are a simple news just dropped 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.849
 a rise of 10% 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.029
 of the world 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.189
 leisure to live 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.139
 what will become of our rights 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.350
 certainly 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.869
 more serene 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.529
 they are entitled 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:43.540
 more targets
