into the hole and push them down all the
way<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> bottom<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.960> that's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
way to the bottom so there we are that's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.490 
way to the bottom so there we are that's
the<00:01:25.259> first<00:01:26.250> set<00:01:26.460> planted<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.840> we're<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.320> do

the first set planted and we're gonna do
that<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.860> each<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.130> their<00:01:29.310> nine<00:01:29.579> holes<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that for each of their nine holes that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.390 
that for each of their nine holes that
we<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.680> let's<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:34.610> number<00:01:35.610> four

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
we have let's do one more number four

we have let's do one more number four
one<00:01:38.400> two<00:01:38.850> three<00:01:39.030> four<00:01:42.979> let's<00:01:43.979> book<00:01:44.310> push<00:01:44.670> them

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
one two three four let's book push them

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.750 
one two three four let's book push them
down<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> bottom<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.720> hole<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.170> again

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
down to the bottom a hole there again

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.460 
down to the bottom a hole there again
and<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.360> reason<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.720> push<00:01:47.930> them<00:01:48.080> down<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and the reason you push them down to the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.980 
and the reason you push them down to the
bus<00:01:48.650> with<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.890> hole<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.810> leak

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
bus with the hole is that the the leak

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.960 
bus with the hole is that the the leak
that<00:01:51.140> grows<00:01:51.320> under<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.680> ground<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.700> white

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
that grows under the ground is the white

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.300 
that grows under the ground is the white
part<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.750> deeper<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.230> is<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.860> more<00:01:55.010> white

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
part so the deeper it is the more white

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.460 
part so the deeper it is the more white
part<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.910> leak<00:01:56.120> you<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.810> then

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
part of the leak you have and then

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.770 
part of the leak you have and then
you've<00:01:57.650> got<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.130> green<00:01:58.460> part<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.510> the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you've got that the green part is is the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.590 
you've got that the green part is is the
bit<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.590> leak<00:02:00.740> over<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.250> ground<00:02:01.600> Sojo

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
bit of leak over the ground Sojo

everything and smell what i'm gonna do
is<00:02:09.229> give<00:02:09.410> them<00:02:09.530> little<00:02:09.680> water<00:02:10.010> in<00:02:10.250> now<00:02:11.030> with

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
is give them little water in now with

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.640 
is give them little water in now with
leaks<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.600> don't<00:02:11.780> have<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.050> fill<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.440> holes

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
leaks you don't have to fill the holes

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.860 
leaks you don't have to fill the holes
you<00:02:13.340> ever<00:02:13.580> look<00:02:13.700> at<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.240> I've<00:02:14.690> actually

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
you ever look at this here I've actually

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.410 
you ever look at this here I've actually
left<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.350> hole<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.920> haven't<00:02:16.580> pushed<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.970> soil

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
left the hole I haven't pushed the soil

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.730 
left the hole I haven't pushed the soil
back<00:02:17.630> into<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.020> because<00:02:18.200> what's<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:18.650> to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
back into it because what's going to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.990 
back into it because what's going to
happen<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> leaks<00:02:19.370> are<00:02:19.490> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> grow

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
happen is the leaks are going to grow

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.090 
happen is the leaks are going to grow
into<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.480> hole<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.070> little

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
into that hole and so just a little

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.960 
into that hole and so just a little
dribble<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.580> water<00:02:22.760> down<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.090> each<00:02:23.180> hole<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
dribble of water down in each hole and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.340 
dribble of water down in each hole and
it's<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.300> pull<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.140> soil

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's going to pull a little bit of soil

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.060 
it's going to pull a little bit of soil
down<00:02:27.560> with<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.690> get<00:02:29.930> there<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.650> roots<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
down with it and get there the roots a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.640 
down with it and get there the roots a
bit<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.310> moisture<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:32.090> well<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:36.110> that's<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
bit of moisture as well and that's this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.280 
bit of moisture as well and that's this
that's<00:02:36.980> me<00:02:37.160> done<00:02:37.310> now<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:37.940> again<00:02:38.540> just<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
that's me done now just again just to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.560 
that's me done now just again just to
emphasize<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:40.040> when<00:02:40.670> you're<00:02:41.330> gonna<00:02:41.480> have

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
emphasize that when you're gonna have

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.030 
emphasize that when you're gonna have
two<00:02:41.780> types<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.140> leaks<00:02:42.320> make<00:02:42.560> sure<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
two types of leaks make sure that you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.010 
two types of leaks make sure that you
only<00:02:43.220> plant<00:02:43.610> one<00:02:43.970> type<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.330> leak<00:02:44.630> into<00:02:44.900> each

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
only plant one type of leak into each

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.770 
only plant one type of leak into each
hole<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.340> reason<00:02:46.490> being<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
hole and the reason being is that the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.110 
hole and the reason being is that the
autumn<00:02:48.320> leaks<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.459> if<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.850> want<00:02:50.030> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
autumn leaks if you if you want to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.670 
autumn leaks if you if you want to
harvest<00:02:50.300> say<00:02:50.570> one<00:02:50.780> autumn<00:02:51.110> making<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.470> to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
harvest say one autumn making this to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.380 
harvest say one autumn making this to
winter<00:02:52.010> links<00:02:52.280> around<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.700> you're<00:02:53.209> gonna<00:02:53.300> have

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
winter links around it you're gonna have

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.150 
winter links around it you're gonna have
to<00:02:53.480> harvest<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.959> whole<00:02:54.140> lot<00:02:54.350> together<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.950> try

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
to harvest the whole lot together so try

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.610 
to harvest the whole lot together so try
and<00:02:55.310> keep<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.610> which<00:02:55.790> leads<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.270> one<00:02:56.930> hole<00:02:57.170> and

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and keep the which leads to one hole and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.080 
and keep the which leads to one hole and
the<00:02:57.739> autumn<00:02:57.980> needs<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.610> another<00:02:58.820> hole

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
the autumn needs to it to another hole

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.500 
the autumn needs to it to another hole
ok<00:02:59.930> that's<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.260> stun
