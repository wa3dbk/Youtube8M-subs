simple<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> use<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.239> tool<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
simple to use this tool all you have to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
simple to use this tool all you have to
do<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.190> drop<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.760> piece<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.120> wood<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
do is drop your piece of wood into the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.490 
do is drop your piece of wood into the
back<00:00:43.410> end<00:00:43.739> clamp<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> down<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.690> run<00:00:46.079> your

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
back end clamp it down and then run your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900 
back end clamp it down and then run your
router<00:00:46.739> bit<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.340> here<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.789> your

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
router bit into here to make your

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.090 
router bit into here to make your
dovetail<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.110> basically<00:00:49.770> makes<00:00:50.010> your

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
dovetail and this basically makes your

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.029 
dovetail and this basically makes your
tails<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> pins<00:00:52.379> made<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
tails now how you get the pins made is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
tails now how you get the pins made is
you<00:00:53.280> take<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.090> across<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.809> gauge<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you take this across the gauge as you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
you take this across the gauge as you
can<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.010> there's<00:00:56.250> several<00:00:56.879> teeth

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
can see right here there's several teeth

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.869 
can see right here there's several teeth
you<00:00:57.690> drop<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.320> place<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.800> such<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.760> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you drop it into place as such then you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
you drop it into place as such then you
tighten<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.629> piece<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.020> wood<00:01:01.199> hence<00:01:01.829> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tighten your piece of wood hence you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
tighten your piece of wood hence you
have<00:01:02.190> aligned<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> tails<00:01:03.840> above<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
have aligned it with the tails above and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
have aligned it with the tails above and
then<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> put<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> we'll

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
then you put this down like so and we'll

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
then you put this down like so and we'll
now<00:01:06.990> cut<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:07.500> pins<00:01:07.830> okay<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:09.090> pins<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
now cut our pins okay and these pins and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
now cut our pins okay and these pins and
tails<00:01:09.930> fit<00:01:10.260> together<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.790> not

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
tails fit together now you do not

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
tails fit together now you do not
necessarily<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:14.070> router

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
necessarily have to use this on a router

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539 
necessarily have to use this on a router
table<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> clamp<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.409> obviously<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
table you can clamp this obviously to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
table you can clamp this obviously to
the<00:01:17.670> side<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> bench<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> see

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the side of the bench as you can see

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
the side of the bench as you can see
right<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:20.280> anything<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.240> able

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
right here or anything that you are able

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
right here or anything that you are able
to<00:01:21.540> clamp<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> run<00:01:23.159> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
to clamp it to and then you can run your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
to clamp it to and then you can run your
router<00:01:23.580> across<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.210> top<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
router across the top now if you want to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.340 
router across the top now if you want to
make<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> longer<00:01:26.670> than<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.049> here

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
make it longer than what you have here

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
make it longer than what you have here
in<00:01:28.530> other<00:01:28.680> words<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.890> say<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> 12<00:01:29.490> inch<00:01:29.729> piece

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
in other words that say a 12 inch piece

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.179 
in other words that say a 12 inch piece
would<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.110> turn<00:01:31.259> around<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> put

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
would you can turn around then and put

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.760 
would you can turn around then and put
the<00:01:32.369> last<00:01:32.729> cut<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> you've<00:01:33.840> made<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.650> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the last cut that you've made into this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.910 
the last cut that you've made into this
slot<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.390> drop<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.200> space<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.650> tool<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
slot and then drop your space or tool in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
slot and then drop your space or tool in
there<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.189> align<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> go

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
there to align it and then you can go

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
there to align it and then you can go
through<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> cut<00:01:40.680> your<00:01:40.890> tails<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> pins<00:01:41.700> as

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
through and cut your tails and pins as
