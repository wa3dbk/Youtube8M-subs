show do all kind of stuff like that so
anyway<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.659> uh<00:01:15.930> I'd<00:01:16.770> say<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.220> 15<00:01:17.670> degrees

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
anyway it's uh I'd say about 15 degrees

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.539 
anyway it's uh I'd say about 15 degrees
I<00:01:18.210> thought<00:01:18.420> it'd<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.600> fun<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> crank<00:01:19.140> forward

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
I thought it'd be fun to crank forward

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.030 
I thought it'd be fun to crank forward
on<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:21.950> if<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> will<00:01:23.250> crack<00:01:24.799> quite<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> while

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
on see if it will crack quite a while

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
on see if it will crack quite a while
since<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.400> started<00:01:27.380> think<00:01:28.380> about<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> board
