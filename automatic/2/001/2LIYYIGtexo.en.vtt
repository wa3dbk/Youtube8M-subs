00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
apart if you do one in you literally

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.880 
apart if you do one in you literally
turn<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:27.570> turn<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.680> one

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
turn this one to the right turn this one

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.610 
turn this one to the right turn this one
to<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> left<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.370> apart<00:02:32.640> again<00:02:33.350> now<00:02:34.350> if<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
to the left and now apart again now if I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.310 
to the left and now apart again now if I
wanted<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> hand<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:35.820> Mouse<00:02:36.260> add<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
handle then I would just put them

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.560 
handle then I would just put them
together<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:40.820> clips<00:02:41.820> on<00:02:42.090> either

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
together with these two clips on either

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.230 
together with these two clips on either
side<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.130> show<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.520> easy<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.090> is

side and just show you how easy that is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.410 
side and just show you how easy that is
to<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:46.160> again<00:02:47.160> you'll<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:48.000> line<00:02:48.209> up<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to do again you'll just line up the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.080 
to do again you'll just line up the
clips<00:02:48.720> together<00:02:49.200> here<00:02:49.680> put<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.760> together
