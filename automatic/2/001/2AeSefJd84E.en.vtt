00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
once the top is snipped then you load up

so<00:02:57.430> very<00:02:57.760> detailed<00:02:58.300> I'm<00:02:59.019> going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> go<00:02:59.350> ahead

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so very detailed I'm going to go ahead

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.020 
so very detailed I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.800> little<00:02:59.950> bit<00:03:00.160> more<00:03:00.310> detailed<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:00.970> I'm

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and be a little bit more detailed so I'm

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.640 
and be a little bit more detailed so I'm
just<00:03:01.209> going<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.390> snip<00:03:01.480> off<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.840> top<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.530> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
just going to snip off the top so it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.040 
just going to snip off the top so it
comes<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:03.070> very<00:03:03.130> little<00:03:03.730> at<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:03.850> time<00:03:03.910> again<00:03:04.870> if

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
comes out very little at a time again if

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.900 
comes out very little at a time again if
you're<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.440> kind<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.950> wanting<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
you're just kind of wanting to get it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
you're just kind of wanting to get it
done<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.420> put<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.140> lot<00:03:08.350> in<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.890> of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
done and put a lot in there then of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.350 
done and put a lot in there then of
course<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.550> would<00:03:09.700> go<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.180> but

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
course then you would go like that but

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.170 
course then you would go like that but
again<00:03:10.450> 45<00:03:11.140> degree<00:03:11.440> angle<00:03:12.340> there<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.820> snips

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
again 45 degree angle there so it snips

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.199 
again 45 degree angle there so it snips
it<00:03:13.330> off<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:13.810> nice<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.470> clean<00:03:14.880> okay<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:16.060> got

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
it off really nice and clean okay we got

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.060 
it off really nice and clean okay we got
to<00:03:16.300> load<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.600> into<00:03:16.690> our<00:03:16.959> gun<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.709> now<00:03:17.860> all

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
to load it into our gun here and now all

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.580 
to load it into our gun here and now all
you<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.730> make<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.079> just<00:03:20.079> push<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you do to make it go just push on the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.020 
you do to make it go just push on the
trigger<00:03:20.709> there<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.370> that's<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.790> start

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
trigger there and that's going to start

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.060 
trigger there and that's going to start
