that's<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.930> best<00:03:58.080> way<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.349> what<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> was

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
that's the best way because what I was

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.949 
that's the best way because what I was
initially<00:03:59.280> doing<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.940> I<00:03:59.970> was<00:04:00.060> pressing<00:04:00.269> really

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
initially doing so I was pressing really

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.680 
initially doing so I was pressing really
hard<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.790> get<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.420> then<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.540> would

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
hard and to get it on and then I would

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.390 
hard and to get it on and then I would
always<00:04:03.840> miss<00:04:04.110> them<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> then<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.620> crash<00:04:04.830> really

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
always miss them and then I crash really

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.710 
always miss them and then I crash really
hard<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.640> get<00:04:05.700> often<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.120> always<00:04:06.239> mess<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.569> up

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
hard to get often and always mess it up

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.630
