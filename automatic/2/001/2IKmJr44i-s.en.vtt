00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
compromising the IPF size and weight so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540 
compromising the IPF size and weight so
rather<00:01:47.600> than<00:01:47.780> developing<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.800> separate<00:01:49.310> case

rather than developing a separate case

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.630 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:50.300> created<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.899> cover<00:01:51.259> at<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.830> same<00:01:52.099> time<00:01:52.369> that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.790 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:52.729> were<00:01:52.849> actually<00:01:52.970> designing<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.869> iPad<00:01:54.229> the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.919 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:54.979> are<00:01:55.130> made<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.610> work<00:01:55.759> together<00:01:55.970> it

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
two are made to work together it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.589 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:57.229> magnetically<00:01:57.759> Airlines<00:01:58.759> perfectly

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.809 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly
and<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.140> just<00:02:00.410> as<00:02:00.530> easy<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.800> remove<00:02:01.160> when<00:02:01.729> the

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
and it's just as easy to remove when the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.089 
and it's just as easy to remove when the
iPad<00:02:02.149> detects<00:02:02.780> you've<00:02:02.989> opened<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.379> cover<00:02:03.679> it

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.130 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it
immediately<00:02:04.640> wakes<00:02:05.060> from<00:02:05.179> sleep<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.840> when

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
immediately wakes from sleep and when

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.900 
immediately wakes from sleep and when
you<00:02:06.229> close<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.679> cover<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.220> puts<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.580> back<00:02:07.700> to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
you close the cover it puts it back to

things<00:04:30.170> for<00:04:30.350> this<00:04:30.560> iPad<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.520> we<00:04:31.640> never<00:04:32.090> could

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
things for this iPad that we never could

things for this iPad that we never could
have<00:04:32.480> done<00:04:32.660> before<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.470> it's<00:04:34.010> because

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
have done before and it's because

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.850 
have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.000> lot<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.270> new<00:04:35.630> innovation<00:04:36.290> driving

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:38.510> starts<00:04:38.930> with<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.260> new<00:04:39.440> dual-core<00:04:39.980> a5

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.640 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:40.850> that's<00:04:41.240> added<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.660> lot<00:04:41.870> more<00:04:41.930> speed<00:04:42.410> to

web sending email and multitasking in
fact<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.740> twice<00:04:48.950> as<00:04:49.190> fast<00:04:49.400> but<00:04:49.760> the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.120 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:50.720> we've<00:04:50.930> made<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.260> biggest<00:04:51.500> jump<00:04:51.950> is

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
place we've made the biggest jump is

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.460 
place we've made the biggest jump is
with<00:04:52.430> graphics<00:04:52.970> with<00:04:53.450> performance<00:04:54.110> that's<00:04:54.320> up

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
to nine times faster you'll really

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.380 
to nine times faster you'll really
notice<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.800> in<00:04:58.010> games<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.700> apps<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.240> use<00:04:59.360> a

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
notice this in games and apps that use a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.260 
notice this in games and apps that use a
lot<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.720> video<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.290> for<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.340> first<00:05:01.550> time<00:05:01.730> we

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
lot of video and for the first time we

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.900 
lot of video and for the first time we
built<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.660> gyro<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.380> design<00:05:03.770> head<00:05:04.040> that

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
built a gyro in the design head that

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.909 
built a gyro in the design head that
gives<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.300> very<00:05:05.630> precise<00:05:06.080> control<00:05:06.650> in

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
gives you very precise control in

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.490 
gives you very precise control in
multiple<00:05:07.520> dimensions<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.600> allows<00:05:08.840> us<00:05:09.169> to

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500 
multiple dimensions and it allows us to
really<00:05:09.830> measure<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.610> orientation<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.450> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
really measure the orientation of the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
features add all kinds of possibilities

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.780

when it comes to apps and even though we

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.580 
when it comes to apps and even though we

the<00:05:43.530> original<00:05:44.040> iPad<00:05:44.540> defined<00:05:45.540> a<00:05:45.750> category<00:05:46.350> and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.190 
the original iPad defined a category and
I<00:05:47.430> think<00:05:47.700> that<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:48.060> peg<00:05:48.330> tube<00:05:48.660> will<00:05:48.930> really

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.810 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.650> category<00:05:50.370> for<00:05:50.670> years<00:05:50.940> to<00:05:51.030> come
