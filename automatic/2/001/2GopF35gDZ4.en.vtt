00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
or three years tweaking with the tuning

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
or three years tweaking with the tuning
pegs<00:00:20.010> till<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.810> buttons<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> be

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
pegs till we got the the buttons to be

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
pegs till we got the the buttons to be
the<00:00:22.470> way<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> wanted<00:00:23.160> yeah<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.640> deal<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.000> the

the way you wanted yeah the deal on the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.200 
the way you wanted yeah the deal on the
tuning<00:00:24.420> keys<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.640> well<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.029> we

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
tuning keys is that well first of all we

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.510 
tuning keys is that well first of all we
got<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:28.910> blocking<00:00:29.910> tuners<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.779> work<00:00:30.990> right

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
got the blocking tuners to work right

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.130 
got the blocking tuners to work right
where<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:33.480> didn't<00:00:33.719> weigh<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> ton<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:36.140> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
where they didn't weigh a ton and you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
degree to figure out how to change the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.400 
degree to figure out how to change the
string<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> forgot<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> gig<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
love I love I love the tuners that they

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.189 
love I love I love the tuners that they
had<00:00:58.289> come<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.480> just<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.780> day<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> took

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
had come up with but just one day I took

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.110 
had come up with but just one day I took
all<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> buttons<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.280> held<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.059> my

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
all the buttons off and held them in my

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.679 
all the buttons off and held them in my
hand<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.960> weighed<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> pound<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
hand and they weighed about a pound and

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
hand and they weighed about a pound and
I<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:07.979> need<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.520> extra

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
I was like do we really need an extra

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
I was like do we really need an extra
pound<00:01:09.240> weight<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> headstock<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:13.010> I<00:01:14.010> had

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pound weight on the headstock so I had

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.800 
pound weight on the headstock so I had
seen<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> love<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> look<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> old

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
seen you know I love the look of old

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.219 
seen you know I love the look of old
clue<00:01:16.110> signs<00:01:17.150> but<00:01:18.150> obviously<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> wanted<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
clue signs but obviously I wanted to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
clue signs but obviously I wanted to
keep<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> locking<00:01:19.799> tuners<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.340> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
keep the locking tuners I think it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
keep the locking tuners I think it's
more<00:01:20.640> effective<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> tremolo<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.689> terms

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
more effective with the tremolo in terms

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.399 
more effective with the tremolo in terms
of<00:01:22.049> tuning<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.060> came<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> i've

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of tuning so we came up with this i've

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
of tuning so we came up with this i've
royde<00:01:25.740> plastic<00:01:26.520> whatever<00:01:26.790> went<00:01:27.000> oh<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.360> don't

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
royde plastic whatever went oh I don't

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.210 
royde plastic whatever went oh I don't
know<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.680> wait<00:01:28.920> nothing

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
know what it is but they wait nothing

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
know what it is but they wait nothing
bone<00:01:29.630> faux<00:01:30.630> bone<00:01:30.840> high<00:01:31.590> void<00:01:31.890> whatever<00:01:32.720> but

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
bone faux bone high void whatever but

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.719 
bone faux bone high void whatever but
they<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.650> weigh<00:01:35.250> practically

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
they don't they weigh practically

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
they don't they weigh practically
nothing<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
nothing so and I also think that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.640 
nothing so and I also think that
aesthetically<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.369> nice

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
aesthetically they look really nice

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
aesthetically they look really nice
which<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> important<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> me<00:01:41.310> too<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which is important to me too just to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.620 
which is important to me too just to
have<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.540> sonically<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
have you know not just the sonically and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
have you know not just the sonically and
playability<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.130> actually<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.820> do

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
playability but I like I actually I do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
playability but I like I actually I do
like<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> guitar<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> looks<00:01:48.869> cool<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like a guitar that looks cool and I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.910 
like a guitar that looks cool and I
think<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> adds<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> overall<00:01:51.920> vibe

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
think that it adds to the overall vibe

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
think that it adds to the overall vibe
of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> guitar<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.390> same<00:01:54.600> discussion<00:01:55.110> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
of the guitar so the same discussion we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.990 
of the guitar so the same discussion we
have<00:01:55.500> about<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> fry<00:01:56.310> wire<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.670> finally

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
have about the fry wire we finally

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
have about the fry wire we finally
decided<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> same<00:01:57.930> discussion<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
decided on the same discussion can be

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
decided on the same discussion can be
about<00:01:59.310> leaving<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> tremolo<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> long<00:02:00.689> but

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
about leaving the tremolo and long but

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.959 
about leaving the tremolo and long but
some<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> things<00:02:01.500> being<00:02:01.770> changed<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.399> huge

with<00:02:39.340> these<00:02:39.489> pickups<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.540> way<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:41.290> was<00:02:41.470> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
with these pickups and the way it was a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.949 
with these pickups and the way it was a
it<00:02:42.400> was<00:02:42.550> an<00:02:42.700> interesting<00:02:43.090> process<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.900> was

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
it was an interesting process it was

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.630 
it was an interesting process it was
frustrating<00:02:44.230> at<00:02:44.620> times<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.040> ultimately<00:02:45.520> it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
frustrating at times but ultimately it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.100 
frustrating at times but ultimately it
was<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.120> were<00:02:46.239> rewarding<00:02:46.900> because<00:02:46.989> I

the<00:03:49.780> pickups<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:50.670> ed<00:03:51.670> Reynolds<00:03:51.970> built<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.570> test

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
the pickups and ed Reynolds built a test

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.170 
the pickups and ed Reynolds built a test
guitar<00:03:53.200> where<00:03:54.010> literally<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.730> could<00:03:54.880> slide

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
guitar where literally you could slide

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.800 
guitar where literally you could slide
the<00:03:55.480> pickups<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:57.340> guitar<00:03:57.700> on<00:03:58.000> Rails<00:03:58.450> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
the pickups in the guitar on Rails that

the pickups in the guitar on Rails that
he<00:03:58.900> built<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.320> then<00:04:00.100> they<00:04:00.459> had<00:04:00.610> alligator

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
he built and then they had alligator

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.949 
he built and then they had alligator
clips<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.600> terminals<00:04:02.730> right<00:04:03.730> here<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.630> in

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
clips to the terminals right here so in

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.140 
clips to the terminals right here so in
it<00:04:05.320> took<00:04:05.500> 15<00:04:05.890> seconds<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.370> change<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.760> pickups

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it took 15 seconds to change out pickups

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.530 
it took 15 seconds to change out pickups
so<00:04:07.239> you've<00:04:07.450> got<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> true<00:04:08.880> comparison<00:04:09.880> apples

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
so you've got a true comparison apples

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.199 
so you've got a true comparison apples
too<00:04:10.660> in<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.989> past<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.980> process<00:04:12.519> of<00:04:12.670> okay<00:04:12.820> put

too in the past the process of okay put
the<00:04:13.299> pickups<00:04:13.630> in<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.900> listen<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.290> them

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
the pickups in you listen to them

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.560 
the pickups in you listen to them

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
this went on for a year until we hit on

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.960 
this went on for a year until we hit on
what<00:05:10.889> I<00:05:10.919> think<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> company<00:05:11.820> know<00:05:11.940> that

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
what I think is the company know that

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.990 
what I think is the company know that
the<00:05:12.300> magic<00:05:12.599> combination<00:05:12.780> for<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:13.380> guitar

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
the magic combination for this guitar

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.060 
the magic combination for this guitar
and<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.960> other<00:05:16.110> thing<00:05:16.380> about<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.710> pickups

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and the other thing about the pickups

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.290 
and the other thing about the pickups
that<00:05:17.460> we<00:05:17.550> did<00:05:17.729> is<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:19.550> in<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.699> past<00:05:20.940> with<00:05:21.150> the

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
that we did is that in the past with the

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.370 
that we did is that in the past with the
guitars<00:05:21.599> the<00:05:21.840> McCarthys

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
guitars the McCarthys

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.589 
guitars the McCarthys
the<00:05:22.680> coil<00:05:22.949> tap<00:05:23.220> position<00:05:23.699> to<00:05:23.849> me<00:05:24.000> has<00:05:24.240> been<00:05:24.389> too

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
the coil tap position to me has been too

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.529 
the coil tap position to me has been too
bright<00:05:24.840> into<00:05:25.639> too<00:05:26.639> much<00:05:26.759> of<00:05:26.819> a<00:05:26.970> drop<00:05:27.240> in<00:05:27.389> volume

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
bright into too much of a drop in volume

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.740 
bright into too much of a drop in volume
and<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:28.759> we<00:05:29.759> went<00:05:30.000> through<00:05:30.060> this<00:05:30.240> elaborate

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
and so we went through this elaborate

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.240 
and so we went through this elaborate
process<00:05:31.349> of<00:05:32.180> capacitor<00:05:33.180> networks<00:05:33.780> and

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
process of capacitor networks and

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.189 
process of capacitor networks and
everything<00:05:35.250> trying<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:36.030> get<00:05:36.240> what<00:05:36.990> I<00:05:37.020> was

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
everything trying to get what I was

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.189 
everything trying to get what I was
after<00:05:37.470> was<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.650> 75%<00:05:38.310> like<00:05:38.909> a<00:05:38.969> 25%<00:05:39.719> drop<00:05:39.870> so

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
after was a 75% like a 25% drop so

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.620 
after was a 75% like a 25% drop so
you're<00:05:40.320> left<00:05:40.469> with<00:05:40.560> 75%<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:42.210> initial

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
you're left with 75% of the initial

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.339 
you're left with 75% of the initial
volume<00:05:43.940> I'm<00:05:44.940> not<00:05:45.150> sure<00:05:45.389> where<00:05:45.570> we<00:05:45.690> ended<00:05:45.960> up

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
volume I'm not sure where we ended up

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.620 
volume I'm not sure where we ended up
but<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.830> know<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.789> the<00:05:48.120> coil<00:05:48.389> tap

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
but I know that the the coil tap

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.990 
but I know that the the coil tap
positions<00:05:49.110> on<00:05:49.229> this<00:05:49.349> guitar<00:05:49.469> are<00:05:50.000> eminently

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
positions on this guitar are eminently

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.670 
positions on this guitar are eminently
more<00:05:51.449> usable<00:05:51.900> than<00:05:52.020> any<00:05:52.199> other<00:05:52.409> guitar<00:05:52.650> I

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
more usable than any other guitar I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.830 
more usable than any other guitar I
played<00:05:53.099> the<00:05:53.550> wind<00:05:53.849> finally<00:05:54.090> came<00:05:54.419> up<00:05:54.449> with<00:05:54.719> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
played the wind finally came up with the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.570 
played the wind finally came up with the
solution<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:55.500> sent<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.919> to<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.340> you<00:05:56.400> said

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
solution and sent it to you and you said

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.459 
solution and sent it to you and you said
that's<00:05:56.789> it<00:05:56.969> I'm<00:05:57.090> done<00:05:57.300> yeah<00:05:57.599> in<00:05:57.810> fact<00:05:57.990> I<00:05:58.259> can

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
that's it I'm done yeah in fact I can

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.110 
that's it I'm done yeah in fact I can
show<00:05:58.650> you<00:05:58.710> real<00:05:59.130> quick<00:06:01.099> so<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.699> know<00:06:02.789> in<00:06:03.000> the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
show you real quick so you know in the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.220 
show you real quick so you know in the
bridge<00:06:03.330> pickup

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.140 

that<00:06:08.230> that's<00:06:08.590> full<00:06:08.890> humbucking<00:06:09.340> not<00:06:09.790> playing

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
that that's full humbucking not playing

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:24.090 
that that's full humbucking not playing
too<00:06:10.360> too<00:06:10.780> hard<00:06:12.240> if<00:06:13.240> I<00:06:13.360> go<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.660> coil<00:06:13.900> tap<00:06:23.100> so

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
too too hard if I go to the coil tap so

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:31.640 
too too hard if I go to the coil tap so
I<00:06:24.130> can<00:06:24.370> really<00:06:24.580> get<00:06:24.700> up<00:06:30.030> you<00:06:31.030> know<00:06:31.120> really

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
I can really get up you know really

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.530 
I can really get up you know really
convincing<00:06:32.650> telly<00:06:32.920> kind<00:06:33.280> of<00:06:33.340> tone<00:06:33.550> and<00:06:33.880> then

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
convincing telly kind of tone and then

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.990 
convincing telly kind of tone and then
the<00:06:35.230> one<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:35.650> really<00:06:36.010> blows<00:06:36.220> my<00:06:36.460> mind<00:06:36.730> is<00:06:36.880> the

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
the one that really blows my mind is the

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:59.580 
the one that really blows my mind is the
neck<00:06:37.180> pickup<00:06:37.450> where<00:06:38.440> I<00:06:38.470> can

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:08.500 

so<00:07:00.590> that's<00:07:00.770> single<00:07:01.160> coil<00:07:06.700> it's<00:07:07.700> not<00:07:07.940> a<00:07:07.970> drastic

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
so that's single coil it's not a drastic

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.870 
so that's single coil it's not a drastic
change<00:07:08.780> but<00:07:09.320> it's<00:07:09.440> just<00:07:09.560> enough<00:07:09.950> to<00:07:10.220> where<00:07:10.550> if

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
change but it's just enough to where if

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.830 
change but it's just enough to where if
I<00:07:11.060> want<00:07:11.300> a<00:07:11.419> a<00:07:11.540> strat<00:07:11.960> neck<00:07:12.260> sound<00:07:16.570> it's<00:07:17.570> there

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
I want a a strat neck sound it's there

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.140 
I want a a strat neck sound it's there
so<00:07:18.560> it's<00:07:18.710> not<00:07:18.770> actually<00:07:19.250> it's<00:07:19.639> the<00:07:19.880> way<00:07:20.000> it's

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
so it's not actually it's the way it's

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.120 
so it's not actually it's the way it's
wired<00:07:20.330> it's<00:07:20.630> not<00:07:20.780> completely<00:07:21.290> single<00:07:21.740> coil<00:07:21.950> it

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
wired it's not completely single coil it

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.980 
wired it's not completely single coil it
cuts<00:07:22.520> out<00:07:22.700> about<00:07:22.970> two-thirds<00:07:23.540> of<00:07:23.750> the<00:07:23.840> other

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
cuts out about two-thirds of the other

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.050 
cuts out about two-thirds of the other
coil<00:07:24.320> it's<00:07:24.830> very<00:07:25.160> interesting<00:07:25.669> the<00:07:25.760> way<00:07:25.790> it's

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
coil it's very interesting the way it's

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.750 
coil it's very interesting the way it's
wired<00:07:26.240> but<00:07:26.419> it<00:07:26.540> works
