00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
I think 41 next thirty ones will work

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.450 
I think 41 next thirty ones will work
and<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.310> won't<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.769> cable<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and you won't need your the cable that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.830 
and you won't need your the cable that
plugs<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.820> your<00:00:32.850> mic<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.320> expertise<00:00:34.770> -

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
plugs in your mic for your expertise -

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.869 
plugs in your mic for your expertise -
we're<00:00:36.840> gonna<00:00:36.960> need<00:00:37.050> 360<00:00:38.040> controllers<00:00:40.850> alright

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we're gonna need 360 controllers alright

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.590 
we're gonna need 360 controllers alright
then<00:00:42.390> you'll<00:00:42.690> need<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.280> plate<00:00:44.280> charge<00:00:44.550> kit<00:00:47.270> um<00:00:48.270> I
