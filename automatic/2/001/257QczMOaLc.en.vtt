 Because the role is the role I'm only one I wanted to say something different than anything else 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.020
 The longest four-fold period is about ten years. 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.810
 Oh yes yes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.070
 Hello, I will buy a man. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 Many people say that I am a name. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.600
 So far I have lived comfortably and comfortably. 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 But it's not true. 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.910
 My parents divorced. 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 I do not have any part-time job. 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.560
 Uh, I've been doing my own care with my mom and sister. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.720
 I just need to do a personality or 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:21.399
 I'm not a fun person. 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.649
 Something that is tough to defend those who defend the four and also taking the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:29.049
 I always say I am in my heart 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:31.770
 So when we saw Mrs. Taewe get married, let's just get it right now. 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.689
 I just came to know you. 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.789
 I do not think I can get a job like that. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.090
 It's going to be very difficult to talk. 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.509
 I think I had a charm 4 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.680

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 I've heard that I think it really well I think that will 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.790
 Hello. Yes. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.510
 I am Korean 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.100
 My father died when I was 18 . 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.140
 She died. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.140
 In the meantime, 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.810
 He said a word to me. 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.910
 So I got to music, I thought it was my way, 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.000

 And the music in the spot advertisement and the music in the opening video 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.970
 You know, I wrote 80% in that year . 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.730
 I'm stout 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.730
 4 O man comes 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.590
 I was born in a wealthy family. 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.549
 Last year I had a house. 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 I do not have any real estate motivations and I would appreciate it immediately . 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.239
 I'm still doing my job too much . 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.430
 It seems you are coming in. 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.780
 I can still do military service two years ago in anticipation that I will have one or two children 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.650

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.050
 I presented the cup to drink and some fun time today, and I think the meantime 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.910
 It's a common request memorable 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:58.320
 If you have a lot of tea cleansing, chats will break up and talk about breaking up with my mouth 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:02.040
