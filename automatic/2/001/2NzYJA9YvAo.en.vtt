00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
strong and this is also very good for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180 
strong and this is also very good for
any<00:00:37.469> strength<00:00:38.040> building<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:40.100> we're<00:00:41.100> looking

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
any strength building so we're looking

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
any strength building so we're looking
at<00:00:41.370> playing<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:41.910> strings<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.420> once

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:06.930 

you've<00:00:55.480> got<00:00:55.659> to<00:00:55.750> stretch<00:00:55.960> you<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:05.820> what's<00:01:06.820> a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
you've got to stretch you know what's a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.609 
you've got to stretch you know what's a
really<00:01:07.149> good<00:01:07.299> thing<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.570> do<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:07.990> break<00:01:08.320> up

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
really good thing to do is to break up

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:20.130 
really good thing to do is to break up
the<00:01:10.680> semi<00:01:11.680> cuevas<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:12.939> you've<00:01:13.060> got<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
the semi cuevas so if you've got that

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.830 
the semi cuevas so if you've got that
means<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.590> got<00:01:23.190> 16<00:01:24.190> notes<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.700> break<00:01:24.909> up<00:01:25.119> so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
means you got 16 notes to break up so

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.120 
means you got 16 notes to break up so
let's<00:01:25.960> break<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.409> up<00:01:26.470> like<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> 3<00:01:29.020> 3<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.520> 4

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
let's break it up like with a 3 3 a 4

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.940 
let's break it up like with a 3 3 a 4
and<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.280> 3<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:34.240> 3<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:35.319> it's<00:01:35.470> like<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.619> bossa

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
and a 3 and a 3 so it's like a bossa

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and a 3 and a 3 so it's like a bossa
nova<00:01:36.549> type<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:37.590> splitting<00:01:38.590> up<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.369> beads

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
nova type of splitting up of the beads

00:01:39.970 --> 00:02:10.449 
nova type of splitting up of the beads
so<00:01:40.600> we've<00:01:40.720> got<00:01:41.700> soy<00:01:42.700> seen<00:01:43.119> at<00:01:43.299> first

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:03:34.879 

this<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.580> good<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.360> is

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.339 

so<00:03:35.889> it<00:03:36.040> gets<00:03:36.190> bad<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.989> have<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.200> keep

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
so it gets bad but just have to keep

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.250 
so it gets bad but just have to keep
calm<00:03:38.560> rational<00:03:38.769> okay<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:39.790> yeah<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:41.019> then<00:03:41.139> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
calm rational okay so yeah and then you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:51.979 
calm rational okay so yeah and then you
do<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> same<00:03:41.829> on<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.099> g<00:03:42.280> string

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.130 

ok

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.610 

so<00:03:59.140> then<00:03:59.290> you've<00:03:59.440> got<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> nice<00:03:59.830> cool<00:04:01.620> gorgeous

in

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
in

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:29.720 
in
ok

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.170 

so<00:04:30.730> you<00:04:31.180> do<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.510> every<00:04:31.750> morning<00:04:32.100> for<00:04:33.180> 10

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
so you do that every morning for 10

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.450 
so you do that every morning for 10

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
strong and it also creates supples

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.830 
strong and it also creates supples
because<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.960> be<00:04:42.450> loose<00:04:43.450> in<00:04:43.690> the
