here<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> have<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.110> new<00:00:04.259> 2015<00:00:04.740> model<00:00:05.339> prestige

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
here I have the new 2015 model prestige

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.440 
here I have the new 2015 model prestige
this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.359> APS<00:00:07.010> 997<00:00:08.010> II<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.610> model<00:00:09.300> has

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
this is the APS 997 II this model has

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.140 
this is the APS 997 II this model has
replacing<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.170> APS<00:00:10.590> 997<00:00:11.340> C<00:00:11.639> which<00:00:11.849> has<00:00:11.940> been

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
replacing the APS 997 C which has been

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.720 
replacing the APS 997 C which has been

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.980 
size you'll notice that the some other
differences<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> engineering

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
differences in the engineering

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.480 
differences in the engineering
department<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.590> far<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:25.949> concerned<00:00:26.070> as

department as far as that's concerned as

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.599 
department as far as that's concerned as
well<00:00:27.029> as<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> siren<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> size

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
well as with the siren you see the size

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.250 
well as with the siren you see the size
of<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.849> arm<00:00:30.060> which<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.599> cumbersome<00:00:31.109> by

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
of this arm which was not cumbersome by

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.060 
of this arm which was not cumbersome by
any<00:00:31.439> degree<00:00:33.079> take<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> look<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> new<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.710> by

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
any degree take a look at the new one by

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
any degree take a look at the new one by
comparison<00:00:35.670> side-by-side<00:00:37.399> you<00:00:38.399> tell<00:00:38.640> me<00:00:39.620> same

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
comparison side-by-side you tell me same

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.200 
comparison side-by-side you tell me same
note<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.219> noise<00:00:41.460> level<00:00:41.879> output

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
note is the same noise level output

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.200 
note is the same noise level output
smaller<00:00:43.050> size<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
smaller size I'm all about that the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
smaller size I'm all about that the
antenna<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.960> new<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.010> they

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
antenna is all new you can see that they

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.660 
antenna is all new you can see that they
have<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> LEDs<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.120> angle<00:00:48.390> right<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:49.670> 15

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have the LEDs on an angle right now 15

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
have the LEDs on an angle right now 15
degrees<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.059> whatever<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.690> guess

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
degrees or whatever have you I guess

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.420 
degrees or whatever have you I guess
that's<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.379> doing<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> better<00:00:52.890> job<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that's going to be doing a better job to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
that's going to be doing a better job to
disperse<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> light<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.469> through<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
disperse the light on through the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
disperse the light on through the
windshield<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> onto<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> dash<00:00:56.699> area<00:00:56.969> they

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
windshield and onto the dash area they

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.310 
windshield and onto the dash area they
move<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> antenna<00:00:58.820> up<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.140> have

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
move the antenna up in here they have

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.160 
move the antenna up in here they have
the<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.590> long<00:01:02.219> style<00:01:03.000> pin<00:01:03.300> plug<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the same long style pin plug up here and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
the same long style pin plug up here and
the<00:01:04.320> program<00:01:04.650> slash<00:01:04.949> valley<00:01:05.189> switch<00:01:05.549> right<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the program slash valley switch right up

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.940 
the program slash valley switch right up
in<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> would<00:01:07.590> typically<00:01:07.860> be

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in here so this would typically be

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.109 
in here so this would typically be
mounted<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.430> behind<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> rear<00:01:08.970> view<00:01:09.030> mirror
