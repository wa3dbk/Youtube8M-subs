00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello dear listeners when 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.320
 center for the upcoming pound week and so 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 what we see by pound by pound we have 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 continues this bear wave who 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 watched last recommendation remembers this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.109
 order is placed the logic of this order 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 stop loss on it here what logic 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.670
 this entry is all about god logic order 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.539
 order logic is that the trend which 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.539
 There is still here 48 14 that it will continue 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.440
 so here bought in the expectation 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.040
 that the trend will go on like this 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.870
 This is not a short-term course here. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.440
 This is an example of how the inputs are here. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 not short term but not short term 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.480
 inputs with small timeframes can 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.820
 so become or not short term inputs with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.940
 small feet but with long term 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 goals 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 bought if the trend continues then this 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.430
 the target is farther and it can reach so 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.750
 further here for example this trend is still 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 can for example let it go on 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.360
 Further on, why stop we set here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 here under this peak 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.650
 under 66 to 102 because the breakdown of this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 peak show the end of it all 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.909
 trend that comes from 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 already from 48 14 therefore our logic 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.439
 our entrance is not verona and it is necessary from the market 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 go here this is a classic example 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.729
 how you can put a stop that is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 wave analysis playstore billed 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 not where there is any amount 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.630
 points or something else at all techniques 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.689
 placing a stop in different notes with 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.420
 talk about wave analysis just 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.149
 is exposed where its triggering from 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.850
 changes the logic of entry that is our 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.820
 input logic on the fact that the trend is here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 48 14 continues means we expose 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.259
 stop where if you hit it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.600
 logic break and what we better find 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.170
 entrances are closer such 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.759
 from the critical moment where we entered 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.560
 the elephant is completely next to logic 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.350
 a little back rewind this logic 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.130
 on stop a small and potential entrance 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.440
 more well what's next for a pound 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.390
 basic tactics work anyway 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.120
 up still here i'm still still 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.700
 inputs up after the end of the wave at 700 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 190 until its termination criteria were not 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.180
 when this wave has formed 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.270
 me here in my 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.480
 there was a warrant to buy yes when I was 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.250
 breakdown I took it down because I 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.470
 hoped that was going to be like this 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.730
 it will be over this wave 1 from not gone then 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:52.310
 I take off the North and just roughly do not 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.380
 we enter the market to work down 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.650
 principle on little time frames on 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.209
 m15 entering one enter only from kickbacks 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.880
 that is, go to a little trick 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.580
 enter only skated Che I do not really 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.069
 like such inputs 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.930
 so that you need to be fixed immediately 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.640
 take profits because this is all 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.739
 wave 7190 on either 1 down after it 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.019
 there will be deep recoils later reversal 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.640
 either corrective for the price will go at all 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.640
 further continue spending up and 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.140
 it is not clear where in general it will end like 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.359
 calculate her goal and so forth well here 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.489
 it is very important to understand trading are important 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.500
 only where did you enter well somewhere later 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.359
 will go out if you go to the market 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.840
 even the entrance is good you don't understand and 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.459
 go beyond that no sense to enter 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 because you can enter for example in 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.200
 market take 50 pips 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.790
 it turns out that we take 500 and went out 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.109
 wrong but I either could at all 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.030
 get to so on that is it 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.880
 it is very important to understand somewhere a shower 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.980
 go out and so when we work in 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.989
 the first wave is incomprehensible here than plus 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.180
 work in the third wave what when goes 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.780
 3 and we can calculate it let's say 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.000
 medium term goals we know 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.400
 that it is long we know that even if 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.220
 it will end after it will be later 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.290
 home for example or further continuation 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.980
 trend here and so how often it happens 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.230
 then 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.690
 so here is the third wave well we 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.519
 we left a deal analysis profit 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.590
 grows on them and he knows well not 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.199
 bother when here if you work 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.000
 here it seems like you can earn 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.410
 long downward movement and so on but where 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.780
 fixed incomprehensible 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.550
 you are afraid that the price is now 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.990
 will continue to follow the trend and you 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.229
 earn nothing and itching 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.970
 come out very psychologically yes 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.949
 so pound tactics 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.770
 still the same basic tactic 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:47.479
 wait until the end of 7190 and buy 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.360
 the end of the wave that is, we need 1 Aries 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.160
 so here is how it was a rollback and therefore 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.199
 here we place an order and enter the world 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.050
 it is important that we see this endings 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.600
 can be closer to the bottom and the second 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.030
 input here i showed it input more after 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.280
 the days of the line are also upward 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.320
 trend continuation 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.690
 Well, somewhere so well and more information for 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.400
 those who want to trade using 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.530
 we have three robots left or 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.389
 four robots and 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.370
 from monday will not be raised 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.080
 the price is therefore who wants to still have time to buy 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.440
 at this price you make an order before 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.979
 monday and draw your attention that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.630
 there is a deposit insurance option 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.530
 if you want to trade big 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:35.510
 amounts then we can give you insurance for us 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.160
 sympathetic if you merge using 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.440
 of our robot we will restore you 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.360
 deposit such is our karate for the first time 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.639
 no one gives such a case 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.099
 because no one is so sure of 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.840
 this robot 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:54.260
 but here dressed so at the moment on 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.610
 I wish you all good luck success 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.610
 learning trade bye
