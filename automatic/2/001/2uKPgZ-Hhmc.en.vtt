00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
the fiber optic for this satellite

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.779 
the fiber optic for this satellite
harness<00:02:05.069> like<00:02:06.069> all

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
harness like all

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.699 
harness like all
hydronic<00:02:07.450> connections<00:02:08.050> we're<00:02:08.500> going<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
hydronic connections we're going to

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.100 
hydronic connections we're going to
start<00:02:08.979> by<00:02:09.250> removing<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.239> outside<00:02:10.630> output

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
start by removing the outside output

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.710 
start by removing the outside output
side<00:02:11.380> fiber<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.610> mercedes-benz<00:02:13.120> at<00:02:13.540> least

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
side fiber and a mercedes-benz at least

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.990 
side fiber and a mercedes-benz at least
the<00:02:13.900> output<00:02:14.230> side<00:02:14.500> fiber<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.400> usually<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the output side fiber is usually the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the output side fiber is usually the
yellow<00:02:16.240> fiber

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
yellow fiber

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.510 
yellow fiber
but<00:02:17.260> you'll<00:02:17.440> always<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.980> double-check

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
but you'll always want to double-check

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.760 
but you'll always want to double-check
we've<00:02:18.880> move<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.300> little<00:02:19.450> center<00:02:19.780> Center<00:02:20.560> blue

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
we've move the little center Center blue

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.030 
we've move the little center Center blue
pin<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.690> always<00:02:22.690> want<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.960> check<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.890> can

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
pin I always want to check and you can

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.620 
pin I always want to check and you can
check<00:02:24.250> by<00:02:24.400> looking<00:02:24.760> at<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> arrow<00:02:25.090> stamped<00:02:25.570> in

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
check by looking at the arrow stamped in

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.740 
check by looking at the arrow stamped in
the<00:02:25.720> plastic<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:27.460> this<00:02:27.610> particular<00:02:28.000> side

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the plastic and in this particular side

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.130 
the plastic and in this particular side
actually<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.710> yellow<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> not<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.930> always

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
actually the yellow is not so you always

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.100 
actually the yellow is not so you always
need<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> check<00:02:33.420> we're<00:02:34.420> gonna<00:02:34.510> release<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
need to check we're gonna release the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.130 
need to check we're gonna release the
output<00:02:35.590> side<00:02:35.860> fiber<00:02:36.720> which<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.930> this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
output side fiber which in this

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.570 
output side fiber which in this
particular<00:02:38.620> case<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> orange<00:02:39.520> side<00:02:44.580> lift

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
particular case is the orange side lift

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.090 
particular case is the orange side lift
up<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.150> plastic<00:02:46.570> tab<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:48.010> a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
up on the little plastic tab just a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.310 
up on the little plastic tab just a
little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.580> not<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.420> much<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.750> break<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.170> but

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
little bit not so much to break it but

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.350 
little bit not so much to break it but
just<00:02:50.500> lift<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.830> up<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.250> little<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.210> got

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
just lift it up just a little and I got

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.000 
just lift it up just a little and I got
it<00:02:52.450> about<00:02:52.540> half<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:53.080> out<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:56.010> okay

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
it about half way out there we go okay

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.600 
it about half way out there we go okay
we've<00:02:57.220> released<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:58.620> we're<00:02:59.620> gonna<00:02:59.740> plug

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
we've released that we're gonna plug

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.290 
we've released that we're gonna plug
that<00:03:00.670> into<00:03:01.090> our<00:03:02.730> fiber-optic<00:03:03.730> harness<00:03:04.090> it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
that into our fiber-optic harness it

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.770 
that into our fiber-optic harness it
came<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.190> eye<00:03:06.580> tronic<00:03:07.180> satellite<00:03:07.600> unit

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
came with the eye tronic satellite unit

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.070 
came with the eye tronic satellite unit
and<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.440> verifying<00:03:11.710> okay<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.360> we<00:03:13.930> take

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
and I'm just verifying okay so we take

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.950 
and I'm just verifying okay so we take
the<00:03:14.260> output<00:03:14.740> side<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:15.340> removed<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.150> hook

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
the output side that we removed and hook

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.050 
the output side that we removed and hook
it<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.350> output<00:03:17.890> side<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.430> eye<00:03:18.520> tronic

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it to the output side of the eye tronic

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.210 
it to the output side of the eye tronic
which<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.930> little<00:03:20.590> inline<00:03:20.980> connector

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
which is the little inline connector

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.310 
which is the little inline connector
just<00:03:21.610> push<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.410> snap<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.590> closed<00:03:24.870> okay<00:03:26.280> then

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
just push it in snap it closed okay then

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.570 
just push it in snap it closed okay then
we're<00:03:29.320> gonna<00:03:29.410> take<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.890> only<00:03:30.160> remaining

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
we're gonna take the only remaining

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.250 
we're gonna take the only remaining
fiber<00:03:30.940> which<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> fiber-optic

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
fiber which is in that fiber-optic

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.280 
fiber which is in that fiber-optic
harness<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.400> push<00:03:34.300> it<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> factory<00:03:34.990> piece

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
harness and push it in the factory piece

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.670 
harness and push it in the factory piece
and<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:36.430> we<00:03:36.640> will<00:03:36.910> insert<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.990> little<00:03:38.410> plug

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
and then we will insert the little plug

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.030 
and then we will insert the little plug
that<00:03:39.520> we<00:03:40.000> removed<00:03:40.360> earlier

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.699 

keeps<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.939> from<00:03:48.230> accidentally<00:03:49.230> falling<00:03:49.319> out

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
keeps it from accidentally falling out

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.209 
keeps it from accidentally falling out
so<00:03:50.459> we've<00:03:50.610> completed<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.359> fiber<00:03:51.569> connection

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
so we've completed the fiber connection

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:53.990 
so we've completed the fiber connection
now<00:03:53.219> we're<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.519> do<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> power

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
now we're going to do the power

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.690 
now we're going to do the power
connection<00:03:56.450> let's<00:03:57.450> see<00:03:58.370> okay<00:03:59.370> we've<00:03:59.519> got<00:03:59.670> a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
connection let's see okay we've got a

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.660 
connection let's see okay we've got a
power<00:03:59.909> connection<00:04:00.359> right<00:04:00.629> here<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:01.670> we're
