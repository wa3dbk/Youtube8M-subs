00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 if you've ever tried reading a 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.830
 pitcher point reviews on a mac you are 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.629
 surely realized that it's rather 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.710
 the galley so today what you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.970
 proposes is to see together all 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.719
 the possibilities we all 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.940
 solutions we have 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 to read point point files on a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.199
 mac for this video I prepared so 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.369
 a sin points to life that has one of my 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 videos I had made that on this 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.300
 match at and if we try to throw it on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.830
 so go see that quicktime tells us well 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 nicely who converts the video there is 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.580
 no problem and everything is actually going 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.060
 see that this little rascal actually he does 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 that slab 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.359
 he'll just tell us who can 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.780
 not open the file so this is it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.980
 is a little planted there one of the solutions 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 we had so far it was to use 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 the little utility if it's not 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.050
 really a utility called 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.280
 perriand and that adds 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 quicktime features 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.129
 among others, that of being able to read 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 point files for life then 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.219
 unfortunately perriand is no longer 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 developed already that in addition it does not 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.309
 works more from mountain 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.370
 so leinen but true that it works 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.260
 no more and use ml you forget and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.610
 and finally finally on her on the iphone he 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 works but you have to use the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 version 1.2.2 is not version 1.2.3 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.500
 which is the one that is available at 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.570
 downloading 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 so that's unfortunately perriand that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 does not work anymore I still have you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.790
 show so we go doubleclick and it's going 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 install it in the panel of 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 configuration we will click on the anthem 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 stahl right there and that's it and we're going 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 try again to start this match is for 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 mac and we'll see that it does not work 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.350
 not much better so perriand one can 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.830
 forget 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.290
 hop I'm moving chaput at all and I 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.400
 delete the little thing 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.140
 so here we can take the problem by 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 different ends or must 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 change the file be it must change 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.320
 the reader if you decide to change from 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.210
 readers there in one that is really very 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.369
 very well called vlc and the rather 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.509
 known and can read really full 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.520
 full full of file types 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.770
 different whether it's points for life 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.090
 but also mkv or elves 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.710
 high I do not know what 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.270
 Anyway, anyway it reads 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 the points for life so that's really 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.799
 nickel so a real solution to read 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 a point-point file on a mac it's 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.939
 to use vlc or any other 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.090
 player other quicktime case that allows 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.350
 to read point files reviews on mac 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.670
 so that's the solution by changing 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.140
 of readers now I told you we 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 can also change files in 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 changing file format by 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.090
 example by putting the video point mp4 and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.259
 quicktime he knows very well how to read 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.330
 mp4 files 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.579
 it's great and for that to change the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 format of a point file for life I you 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.930
 advises software and adapter and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.290
 enrique mbeki is the one who is the most 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.180
 known 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 it's an open source file that dates 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.329
 which really begins the theme 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.099
 is still really up to date 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.569
 there is also a version 1.0 which 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.610
 must be out soon that will be archi 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.890
 So complete in Belgium presents 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.420
 like these not just click on 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.549
 the little button sources have chosen the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.329
 video he'll load the video everything 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.700
 simply 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.739
 and then we choose the format mp4 and we 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.629
 can click start when it will be 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.440
 ready then you and we're full 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.090
 full of settings 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.099
 so it's really very professional 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.139
 as software despite it being to 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.780
 open source fears and all and free 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.920
 so it's really nice and so 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 once you have a brick is 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.730
 ready we can click start and it's going 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.940
 start converting our file 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.950
 inflicted mp4 if you find that henrik 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.389
 retro must be professional we have 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.409
 also adapter which is much more 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.060
 easy to understand 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.109
 easy to use at startup it goes 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.670
 ask to download fff done mpeg-1 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.260
 which is a small module that allows him 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.430
 to convert so we'll allow it 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.190
 to download that there is no problem 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.449
 you can trust 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.129
 and when he's done downloading 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.599
 you can use it very easily 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.129
 so we'll just slip our 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.109
 video in hop 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.329
 then we will choose in what format 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.030
 we want to convert it to klai if we put 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.949
 in mp4 perfect here we have some small 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.359
 settings if you want them to be 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.010
 quite complete also 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.010
 and then just click on 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.180
 convert and it starts the converts 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.669
 wise of the video I do not know if it's 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 said but it's nice then for those who 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.919
 wonder why I advise you 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.900
 these two there simply because this 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.160
 are the two real free it's not 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.260
 advertisers so could the 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.299
 use totally for free and they 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.410
 are really very full so that's it 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.489
 usually you will find plenty 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.750
 others who are supposedly free 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.590
 but in fact it's ad and then 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.000
 you will have to pay 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.099
 finally, I really advise you 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.629
 these two there so here you choose 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.340
 software that you want to adapter or 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.109
 enrique anyway in the end 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.000
 your sin points to screw will become a 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.819
 mp4 hand file that you will be able to 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.900
 read without problem with quicktime and 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.489
 So that's all for this little girl 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.930
 video as usual find yourself 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.290
 all resources in the file 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.579
 zip of the video wallpaper included me 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.989
 I tell you very very soon for 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.989
 next videos hi to all
