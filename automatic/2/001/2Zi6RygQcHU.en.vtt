 and also the whole commercial communication sector 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.890
 let's say that then the figure of the face to the se a very interconnected figure between the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.810
 various business functions therefore 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.540
 and that also a little bit beautiful because you do a little touch all that is 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 a company reality in the whole sauce 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.720
 I started lowering luggage by folding shirts 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.829
 in a shop on saturday then I went on to selling myself

 thun 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.040
 we say 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.309
 I started at 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.170
 to go up 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 therefore also doing bayer hope 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.360
 then taking care of but a whole shop then as a note 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:12.410
 responsible 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.500
 heart shop then a train passed 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.350
 that I decided to take then I became then starting first as 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.620
 purely profile 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.940
 operating later then also acquiring responsibility from a point of 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.930
 view mageia 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.460
 graft of have not been specific studies around the need I have 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.670
 graduated in business communication with a thesis on the visual fingers of gucci 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 and I found myself a visual merchandiser file by chance 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.790
 and it is a job that then also saw me very passionate so I have 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.040
 then decided to do it 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.870
 a profession even for the double lasts my typical day or 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.590
 it depends on whether they are in the office, it is held fairly regularly then 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.980
 entry to the then typical lion at 9 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.860
 cushions ita 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.960

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.809
 in case you are traveling as my profile is a profile also 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.109
 quite anp very let's say itinerant 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.909
 alarm clock hahah, 4l 5 in the morning, hour 2 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.239
 come back now the same evening so going hours 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.719
 that who works normally 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.269
 could be unthinkable, see midday and one day maybe not 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.409
 return after two days 3 days 4 days then this depends on what kind of 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.129
 work is done outside 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.909
 the instruments in addition to those of a. creativity humility patience 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.389
 want to do 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.639
 only sun we know that instruments are relegated to graphics and therefore digital 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.789
 then all of them as many applications as 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.669
 freehand photoshop 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.869
 from illustretor but also of trivial in power point 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.439
 know how to use limenella 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.319
 possibly a ladder if you have to climb up a shop window 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.269
 creativity is very important 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.739
 it's a part 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.899
 anyway 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.629
 very important but always service 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.769
 of the brenda 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769
 we must always remember that we are not 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.729
 send a message but your own brand that they had to message therefore for everything 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.809
 what is our taste must always be limited 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.909
 everything to what is hoped 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.299
 of the brand 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.510
 in 10 years I'll see it surely resound in the field 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.010
 of design fashion for sure 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.830
 I still hope to be 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.329
 in curious as I am now as enthusiastic as I am 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.030
 now maybe not born 1 to work inside if treviso al ma however e 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.239
 a sector that is inherent in this world 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.469
 advice or for young people 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.469
 then unity 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:14.859
 It's a decision 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.949
 those are 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.919
 are fundamental things never lose sight of btv but never try to 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:27.080
 in posing too much as a compulsive figure to interface because 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.169
 sometimes the bravado doesn't pay
