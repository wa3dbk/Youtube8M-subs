00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.470
 October afternoon they had 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 clay leaves because we had re-entry 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.650
 we had finished eating and we were 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.870
 going to school when we see 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 this tell we had always seen that 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.520
 decided a friend of mine laughing says about 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.750
 come in and everyone agreed except 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.050
 I could go get ice cream 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 merkel 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.480
 no, but he knows when you know those friends 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.780
 let yourself be carried away and start following 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.730
 mass and therefore convinced me too 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.120
 I drive into the hotel and the saint 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.790
 initial life and there were so many traps 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.900
 for mice scattered on the ground 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.870
 we decide to continue 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.870
 bad idea before us was another 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.240
 room we enter this room and 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.540

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.610
 half full alcohol bottle a 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.200
 cocktail glass near a book 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.990

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.510
 upside down the little they are from this 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.820
 room in front of us opens a 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.330
 long corridor that ended with one 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.090

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.010
 let's go back 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.550
 what happened I start saying that it is 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 better that we go out just right 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.890
 making time to go to the right class 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.320
 but they don't listen to me and start to 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 walk through this corridor I saw 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.230

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.850
 institute leaving this hotel on the floor 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.070
 upstairs 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.900
 I didn't climb and he came out when 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.030
 you love me that my other companions were 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.200
 went up and on their return they were all 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.760
 frightened 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.709
 then I got myself told that 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.300
 that they saw rose to the floor of 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.870
 above with a little wooden staircase 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.290
 hall of the hotel with the bell 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.720
 so that I am lost because the hall 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.700

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.730
 in any case they felt like a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.220
 thrills behind them as god I 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.470
 I had read on a site somewhere 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.690
 or someone told me they are 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.390
 like the dead when you feel like the air 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.540
