designer I like to dress young women I
try<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> consider<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.710> modern<00:01:08.040> life<00:01:08.300> quite

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
try to consider the modern life quite

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.469 
try to consider the modern life quite
busy<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.250> wear<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> collections<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
busy and you can wear the collections in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.050 
busy and you can wear the collections in
many<00:01:12.720> different<00:01:13.170> situations<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.640> really

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
many different situations that really

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960 
many different situations that really
depends<00:01:15.660> on<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.050> will<00:01:16.560> style<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.430> think

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
depends on how you will style it I think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.260 
depends on how you will style it I think
it<00:01:18.119> might<00:01:18.300> work<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.110> mm<00:01:19.649> yeah<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it might work like this mm yeah it's a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.770 
it might work like this mm yeah it's a
typical<00:01:21.780> autumn<00:01:22.259> collection<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.149> it<00:01:24.149> mixes<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
typical autumn collection and it mixes a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
typical autumn collection and it mixes a
lot<00:01:25.050> of<00:01:25.170> materials<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.190> colors

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
lot of materials and colors

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
lot of materials and colors
I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.810> scenery<00:01:28.080> says<00:01:28.470> collection<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
I think scenery says collection is a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.600 
I think scenery says collection is a
combination<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.810> distill<00:01:31.500> aesthetic<00:01:32.100> very

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
combination of a distill aesthetic very

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.420 
combination of a distill aesthetic very
feminine<00:01:33.530> beautifully<00:01:34.530> articulate<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
feminine beautifully articulate in

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630 
feminine beautifully articulate in
fabrics<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> color<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.650> juxtapose

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

fabrics in color it's it's a juxtapose
collection<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.330> really<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.229> mix

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
collection I really like to mix

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
collection I really like to mix
materials<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.720> leather<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> silk<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.240> shiny

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
materials as leather and silk and shiny
and<00:01:45.420> matte<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> gives<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.010> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and matte and that kind of gives it a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.370 
and matte and that kind of gives it a
young<00:01:48.170> look<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.010> same<00:01:50.250> time<00:01:50.520> very

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.469 

it's<00:01:53.890> really<00:01:54.340> hard<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.760> choose<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:55.060> one

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
it's really hard to choose just one

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's really hard to choose just one
favorite<00:01:56.140> comment<00:01:56.770> from<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.130> election<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:58.090> I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
favorite comment from the election but I

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.870 
favorite comment from the election but I
guess<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.960> would<00:01:59.170> be<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.950> blue<00:02:00.550> jacket

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
guess it would be the blue jacket

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
guess it would be the blue jacket
because<00:02:01.600> it's<00:02:01.950> quite<00:02:02.950> cool<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.670> young<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
because it's quite cool and young and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.020 
because it's quite cool and young and
you<00:02:05.320> just<00:02:05.530> feel<00:02:06.390> great<00:02:07.390> when<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:07.780> wear<00:02:07.990> it
