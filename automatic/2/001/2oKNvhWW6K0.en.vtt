00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.050 

then<00:02:20.530> we're<00:02:20.680> gonna<00:02:20.770> take<00:02:21.010> our<00:02:21.220> lightest<00:02:21.730> shade

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
then we're gonna take our lightest shade

then we're gonna take our lightest shade
which<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.450> medium<00:02:22.900> gray<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.410> our<00:02:24.360> blender

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
which is a medium gray on our blender

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.190 
which is a medium gray on our blender
