to<00:00:21.660> brag<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.800> two<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.550> show

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to brag that I can do it and two to show

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
to brag that I can do it and two to show
you<00:00:23.789> guys<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.029> obviously<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.350> done

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you guys that obviously it can be done

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
you guys that obviously it can be done
but<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.220> also<00:00:26.369> pretty<00:00:26.670> hard<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.240> because

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
but it's also pretty hard to do because

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.019 
but it's also pretty hard to do because
the<00:00:27.810> ads<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.439> buff<00:00:28.650> each<00:00:28.830> other<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.849> it's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the ads they buff each other and so it's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
the ads they buff each other and so it's
like<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.599> 12<00:00:30.960> ads<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
like you got to like 12 ads here so that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.260 
like you got to like 12 ads here so that
he's<00:00:32.160> doing<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:32.700> hundred<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> forty

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
he's doing like two hundred and forty

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.520 
he's doing like two hundred and forty
percent<00:00:33.510> extra<00:00:33.750> damage<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.200> each<00:00:34.320> ad

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
percent extra damage because each ad

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.560 
percent extra damage because each ad
buffs<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.489> AD<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.420> know

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
buffs the other AD by like I don't know

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.760 
buffs the other AD by like I don't know
like<00:00:36.630> twenty<00:00:37.050> percent<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.440> guess<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> would

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
like twenty percent I guess that would

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.950 
like twenty percent I guess that would
be<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> math<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.719> pull

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
be the math right and so you just pull

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
be the math right and so you just pull
him<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.710> obviously<00:00:40.800> down<00:00:41.520> that's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
him and you can obviously down that's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
him and you can obviously down that's
like<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.989> 680<00:00:43.410> item<00:00:43.920> mobile<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

like I I'm like 680 item mobile in this
video<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.690> probably<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.020> or

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

you<00:01:36.540> guys<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.869> see<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:38.159> goes<00:01:38.340> down

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you guys can see there he goes down

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
you guys can see there he goes down
towards<00:01:39.060> Grom<00:01:39.299> ashore<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> he<00:01:40.140> goes<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
towards Grom ashore and he goes all the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
towards Grom ashore and he goes all the
way<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.860> around<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> guess<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
way up around and I guess like a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.020 
way up around and I guess like a
clockwise<00:01:42.540> function<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.290> fashion<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.909> he

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
clockwise function or fashion and is he

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
clockwise function or fashion and is he
gave<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.570> doesn't<00:01:45.899> move<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.049> fans<00:01:46.560> right

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
gave me he doesn't move that fans right

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.249 
gave me he doesn't move that fans right
and<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.210> catch<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> him<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.079> what

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the way I let myself die and I just

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.789 
the way I let myself die and I just
wanted<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.930> see<00:02:52.019> if<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.200> guards<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.650> kill

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
wanted to see if the guards could kill

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.220 
wanted to see if the guards could kill
on<00:02:52.890> themselves<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:54.569> didn't<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:55.079> he

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
on themselves and they didn't like he

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.780 
on themselves and they didn't like he
actually<00:02:55.349> killed<00:02:55.709> all<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> guards<00:02:56.430> at<00:02:56.579> any

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
actually killed all the guards at any

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.900 
actually killed all the guards at any
reset<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:58.560> careful<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.160> but<00:02:59.549> i<00:02:59.579> think

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
reset and so be careful that but i think

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.150 
reset and so be careful that but i think
the<00:03:00.000> guards<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.269> also<00:03:00.540> respawn<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.069> you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the guards will also respawn and so you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
the guards will also respawn and so you
can<00:03:02.280> heal<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.670> guards<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.269> all<00:03:03.420> kinds<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
can heal the guards and all kinds of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.809 
can heal the guards and all kinds of
other<00:03:03.780> stuff<00:03:04.079> too<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.489> go<00:03:05.579> ahead<00:03:05.700> and

and so I've got all the guards attacking
up<00:03:57.510> now<00:03:57.630> if<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.049> have<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.260> guard<00:03:58.470> stacking

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
up now if you have the guard stacking

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.099 
up now if you have the guard stacking
and<00:03:59.190> every<00:03:59.940> 20<00:04:00.209> seconds<00:04:00.599> he's<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.959> cast

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
and every 20 seconds he's going to cast

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.349

every of the guards attacking what you

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.319 
every of the guards attacking what you
can<00:04:05.160> do<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.430> can<00:04:05.459> run<00:04:05.760> away<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.150> he's

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
can do is you can run away because he's

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.970 
can do is you can run away because he's
going<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.540> cast<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.870> every<00:04:07.260> single<00:04:07.440> time<00:04:07.590> it's
