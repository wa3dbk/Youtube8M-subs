00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you didn't know and this guy is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
you didn't know and this guy is
definitely<00:01:21.570> definitely<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.979> played

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
definitely definitely up there i played

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
definitely definitely up there i played
him<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.790> cam<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.009> probably

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
him a cam and I think that's probably

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.770 
him a cam and I think that's probably
his<00:01:26.640> best<00:01:26.790> position<00:01:27.030> either<00:01:27.450> they're<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
his best position either they're a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
his best position either they're a
centre-forward<00:01:28.189> wouldn't<00:01:29.189> recommend<00:01:29.579> them

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
centre-forward wouldn't recommend them

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.950 
centre-forward wouldn't recommend them
anywhere<00:01:30.000> else<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.630> you'd<00:01:30.750> see

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
anywhere else I don't think you'd see

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.649 
anywhere else I don't think you'd see
him<00:01:31.079> much<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.560> CM<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.460> his<00:01:32.729> dribbling<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> his

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
him much at CM but his dribbling and his

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.020 
him much at CM but his dribbling and his
shooting<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.500> absolutely<00:01:34.860> insane<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
shooting is just absolutely insane the
