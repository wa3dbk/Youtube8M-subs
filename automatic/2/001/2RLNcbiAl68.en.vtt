tree<00:02:03.580> for<00:02:03.850> every<00:02:04.120> book<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.390> rinse<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.550> I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
tree for every book you rinse and I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.730 
tree for every book you rinse and I
thought<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.510> was<00:02:07.690> really<00:02:07.870> nifty<00:02:08.140> because

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
thought that was really nifty because

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.480 
thought that was really nifty because
not<00:02:09.010> only<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.580> save<00:02:09.880> money<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:11.260> also<00:02:11.530> save

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
not only do you save money you also save

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.030 
not only do you save money you also save
some<00:02:12.760> trees<00:02:12.940> by<00:02:13.570> not<00:02:13.870> buying<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.530> brand<00:02:14.830> new

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
some trees by not buying a brand new

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.780 
some trees by not buying a brand new
book<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.880> they<00:02:16.120> had<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.420> make<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.350> also<00:02:17.790> in

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
book that they had to make but also in

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.760 
book that they had to make but also in
addition<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.510> they<00:02:19.840> plant<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.440> tree<00:02:20.740> for

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
addition to that they plant a tree for

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.880 
addition to that they plant a tree for
every<00:02:21.280> book<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.520> went<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.710> really

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
every book you went so this is really

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.620 
every book you went so this is really
cool<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.490> mean<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.730> save<00:02:24.940> money<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.480> you're

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
cool I mean you save money and you're

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.200 
cool I mean you save money and you're
saving<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.110> environment<00:02:26.670> um<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:30.060> once<00:02:31.060> you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
saving the environment um and once you

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.990 
saving the environment um and once you
write<00:02:31.600> your<00:02:31.750> books<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.530> track<00:02:32.830> them<00:02:33.070> see

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
write your books you can track them see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.670 
write your books you can track them see
these<00:02:34.150> are<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.360> four<00:02:34.600> books<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.560> I've

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
these are the four books that I've

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.490 
these are the four books that I've
rented<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.820> click<00:02:37.450> track<00:02:37.870> here<00:02:38.230> and

it'll show you exactly what's happening

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
it'll show you exactly what's happening
where<00:02:41.350> they<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.980> when<00:02:42.250> an<00:02:42.490> estimate<00:02:42.970> of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
where they are and when an estimate of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
where they are and when an estimate of
when<00:02:43.270> they'll<00:02:43.450> get<00:02:43.600> here<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:45.130> also<00:02:45.250> have

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
when they'll get here and they also have

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.700 
when they'll get here and they also have
a<00:02:45.640> list<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.240> total<00:02:46.510> savings<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.170> I've<00:02:47.410> saved

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
a list of total savings and I've saved

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.350 
a list of total savings and I've saved
around<00:02:48.250> two<00:02:48.550> hundred<00:02:48.640> dollars<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:51.360> that's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
around two hundred dollars and that's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.630 
around two hundred dollars and that's
that's<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.110> lot<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.290> money<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.860> am<00:02:54.160> very

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that's a lot of money I am very

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.280 
that's a lot of money I am very
satisfied<00:02:54.970> with<00:02:55.450> how<00:02:55.600> much<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.900> save<00:02:56.140> this

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
satisfied with how much I save this

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.690 
satisfied with how much I save this
quarter<00:02:59.010> alright<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.190> I'm<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.460> show<00:03:00.610> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
quarter alright so I'm going to show you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.370 
quarter alright so I'm going to show you
some<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.880> my<00:03:01.000> books<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.480> taking<00:03:01.980> biology<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
some of my books and taking biology and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.010 
some of my books and taking biology and
organic<00:03:05.380> chemistry<00:03:05.920> no<00:03:06.580> not<00:03:07.090> fun<00:03:07.360> at<00:03:07.450> all<00:03:07.570> but

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
organic chemistry no not fun at all but

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.000 
organic chemistry no not fun at all but
yeah<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.470> did<00:03:08.800> have<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.100> buy<00:03:09.190> some<00:03:09.550> books<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.860> my

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
yeah I did have to buy some books for my

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.510 
yeah I did have to buy some books for my
class<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.850> rented<00:03:13.330> them<00:03:13.650> here<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.310> one

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
class so I rented them here is the one

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.650 
class so I rented them here is the one
you<00:03:16.300> saw<00:03:16.450> earlier<00:03:16.630> essential<00:03:17.440> genetics<00:03:17.860> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you saw earlier essential genetics it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.729 
you saw earlier essential genetics it
was<00:03:19.660> reported<00:03:20.350> as<00:03:20.560> used<00:03:21.520> but<00:03:21.790> very<00:03:22.000> good<00:03:22.239> and

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
was reported as used but very good and

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.050 
was reported as used but very good and
if<00:03:23.739> they<00:03:24.130> didn't<00:03:24.400> say<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.580> i<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:24.970> have

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
if they didn't say that i would have

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.260 
if they didn't say that i would have
thought<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.360> was<00:03:25.510> brand<00:03:25.900> brand<00:03:26.230> new<00:03:26.440> and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
thought this was brand brand new and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.180 
thought this was brand brand new and
modern<00:03:28.270> projects<00:03:29.080> blah<00:03:29.410> blah<00:03:29.620> blah<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
modern projects blah blah blah and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.220 
modern projects blah blah blah and
organic<00:03:30.580> chemistry<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.870> tell<00:03:32.050> us<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> little

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
organic chemistry you tell us a little

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.410 
organic chemistry you tell us a little
bit<00:03:32.380> used<00:03:32.680> because<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.340> corners<00:03:33.730> are<00:03:34.120> kind<00:03:34.360> of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
bit used because the corners are kind of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.390 
bit used because the corners are kind of
worn<00:03:34.600> down<00:03:34.810> but<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.440> pages<00:03:35.769> inside<00:03:36.040> or<00:03:36.190> mint

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
worn down but the pages inside or mint

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.090 
worn down but the pages inside or mint
condition<00:03:37.530> techniques<00:03:38.530> are<00:03:38.650> organic

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
condition techniques are organic

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100 
condition techniques are organic
chemistry<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.850> looks<00:03:40.060> absolutely<00:03:40.480> knew<00:03:40.870> I

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
chemistry it looks absolutely knew I

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.610 
chemistry it looks absolutely knew I
believe<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:43.170> solutions<00:03:44.170> manual<00:03:44.290> for

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
believe it is and a solutions manual for

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.830 
believe it is and a solutions manual for
chemistry<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.640> think<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.300> also<00:03:46.600> very

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
chemistry and I think this is also very

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.650 
chemistry and I think this is also very
new<00:03:47.110> all<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:48.010> them<00:03:48.130> are<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:49.000> almost<00:03:49.450> in

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
new all of them are like almost in

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.710 
new all of them are like almost in
perfect<00:03:50.050> condition<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.480> one<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.600> the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
perfect condition and one of the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.440 
perfect condition and one of the
guarantees<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.820> they<00:03:54.820> don't<00:03:55.450> ship<00:03:55.750> um

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
guarantees is they don't ship um

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.940 
guarantees is they don't ship um
low-quality<00:03:58.450> books<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.470> if<00:03:59.650> you're<00:03:59.800> not

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
low-quality books and if you're not

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.860 
low-quality books and if you're not
happy<00:04:00.190> with<00:04:00.340> what<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.850> have<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.450> can<00:04:01.630> request

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
happy with what you have you can request

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.320 
happy with what you have you can request
for<00:04:02.260> them<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.980> send<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.459> another<00:04:03.640> one<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.180> you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
for them to send you another one and you

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.479 
for them to send you another one and you
can<00:04:04.510> return<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.840> one<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.050> have<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:06.190> they<00:04:06.340> come

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
can return the one you have so they come

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.180 
can return the one you have so they come
