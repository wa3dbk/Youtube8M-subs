remember who suggested but it was like

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.350 
remember who suggested but it was like
sand<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.890> do<00:00:28.950> sand<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.430> so<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.119> knew<00:00:30.240> we

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
sand got to do sand and so we knew we

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.850 
sand got to do sand and so we knew we
were<00:00:30.450> biting<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> lot<00:00:31.110> and<00:00:31.289> decided<00:00:31.680> to<00:00:31.710> do

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
were biting off a lot and decided to do

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.189 
were biting off a lot and decided to do
the<00:00:31.980> desert<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.780> realized<00:00:34.050> like

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
the desert but I think we realized like

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.840 
the desert but I think we realized like
okay<00:00:34.379> we<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.680> push<00:00:34.890> our<00:00:35.250> tech<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.760> an

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
okay we can push our tech in an

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.830 
okay we can push our tech in an
interesting<00:00:36.210> new<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.660> we've<00:00:36.750> never

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
interesting new way that we've never

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
interesting new way that we've never
really<00:00:37.020> done<00:00:37.199> before<00:00:37.280> then<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.400> top<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really done before then on top of that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.640 
really done before then on top of that
just<00:00:38.970> looking<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.360> okay<00:00:39.480> where<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.470> feel

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
just looking at okay where do we feel

just looking at okay where do we feel
like<00:00:40.739> last<00:00:41.010> game<00:00:41.160> sort<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.519> where<00:00:42.150> could<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
like last game sort of where could have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.580 
like last game sort of where could have
been<00:00:42.480> improved<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.019> animation<00:00:43.440> system

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
been improved the animation system

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.530 
been improved the animation system
streaming<00:00:44.400> animations<00:00:44.790> now<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.180> get

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
streaming animations now we actually get

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.450 
streaming animations now we actually get
Drake<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.379> react<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.650> what's<00:00:46.920> around<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Drake to react to what's around them in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.070 
Drake to react to what's around them in
new<00:00:47.729> and<00:00:47.760> interesting<00:00:48.000> ways<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.960> makes

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
new and interesting ways it really makes

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.660 
new and interesting ways it really makes
the<00:00:49.199> player<00:00:49.350> feel<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.739> oh<00:00:49.830> I'm<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.519> I'm

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the player feel like oh I'm there I'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
the player feel like oh I'm there I'm
feeling<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.089> emotion<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.540> Drake's<00:00:51.839> feeling

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
feeling the emotion that Drake's feeling

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.240 
feeling the emotion that Drake's feeling
and<00:00:52.229> it<00:00:52.290> makes<00:00:52.409> him<00:00:52.530> feel<00:00:52.650> much<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.040> like<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and it makes him feel much more like a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
and it makes him feel much more like a
grounded<00:00:54.089> character<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.629> world<00:00:54.809> we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
grounded character in the world we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
grounded character in the world we
always<00:00:55.409> try<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.650> make<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.549> environment<00:00:56.850> seem

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
always try to make the environment seem

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
always try to make the environment seem
like<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> character<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.900> themselves<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.620> now

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
like a character in themselves and now

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
like a character in themselves and now
because<00:00:59.339> we're<00:00:59.489> globe-trotting<00:00:59.970> more<00:01:00.269> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
because we're globe-trotting more the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
because we're globe-trotting more the
idea<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> specific<00:01:01.140> locations<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.220> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
idea is the specific locations take on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
idea is the specific locations take on
sort<00:01:02.729> of<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.940> persona<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> sort<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
sort of that persona of the sort of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
sort of that persona of the sort of
adversarial<00:01:04.890> nature<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.670> genre<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.180> mean

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
adversarial nature of this genre I mean

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
adversarial nature of this genre I mean
it<00:01:06.450> could<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.720> literal<00:01:07.080> adversaries<00:01:07.710> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it could be your literal adversaries but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
it could be your literal adversaries but
also<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.030> man<00:01:09.240> against

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
also could just be you know man against

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
also could just be you know man against
nature<00:01:09.630> man<00:01:10.229> against<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> crumbling<00:01:10.950> jet<00:01:11.190> oh

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
nature man against the crumbling jet oh

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
nature man against the crumbling jet oh
yeah<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.060> always<00:01:12.210> try<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.659> sure<00:01:12.869> he's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
yeah so we always try to make sure he's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
yeah so we always try to make sure he's
got<00:01:13.110> obstacles<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> confront<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.790> really

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
got obstacles to confront no it's really

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
got obstacles to confront no it's really
cool<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.510> we're<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:15.869> proud<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.409> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
climbing on physics object stuff writing

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
climbing on physics object stuff writing
like<00:01:29.340> fire<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.719> just<00:01:30.840> about

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
