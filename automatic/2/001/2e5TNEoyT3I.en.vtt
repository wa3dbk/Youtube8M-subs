00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
I bought the Hobby week easy run

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.540 
I bought the Hobby week easy run
brushless<00:00:17.480> motor<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.350> we'll<00:00:19.130> be<00:00:19.250> installing

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
brushless motor and we'll be installing

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.509 
brushless motor and we'll be installing
but<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.119> wanted<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:20.480> give<00:00:20.689> you<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:21.140> idea<00:00:22.099> of<00:00:22.339> what

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
but I wanted to give you a idea of what

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.249 
but I wanted to give you a idea of what
it<00:00:22.609> looked<00:00:22.820> like<00:00:22.910> stock<00:00:23.419> before<00:00:23.960> we<00:00:24.079> went

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
it looked like stock before we went

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.529 
it looked like stock before we went
ahead<00:00:24.380> and<00:00:24.650> put<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:25.279> on<00:00:25.429> there<00:00:25.669> this<00:00:26.390> is<00:00:26.509> a

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
ahead and put this on there this is a

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.859 
ahead and put this on there this is a
tin<00:00:26.869> tee<00:00:27.079> it's<00:00:28.009> in<00:00:28.130> turn<00:00:28.279> on<00:00:28.429> it<00:00:28.579> so<00:00:28.849> we're<00:00:29.839> just

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
tin tee it's in turn on it so we're just

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.419 
tin tee it's in turn on it so we're just
gonna<00:00:30.050> drive<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:30.349> around<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.619> bit<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.039> then

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
gonna drive it around a bit and then

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.160 
gonna drive it around a bit and then
I'll<00:00:31.550> put<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.239> motor<00:00:32.450> in<00:00:32.599> there<00:00:32.810> and<00:00:32.989> get<00:00:33.079> you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
I'll put the motor in there and get you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'll put the motor in there and get you
another<00:00:33.380> video<00:00:33.590> after<00:00:34.010> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

hey guys this is Chris with help me fly
it<00:01:11.259> I've<00:01:11.680> installed<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.369> hobby<00:01:12.970> parts<00:01:13.299> easy

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
it I've installed the hobby parts easy

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.609 
it I've installed the hobby parts easy
run<00:01:14.020> brushless<00:01:14.590> motor<00:01:15.039> I<00:01:15.909> did<00:01:16.420> have<00:01:16.600> issue<00:01:17.350> in

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
run brushless motor I did have issue in

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.139 
run brushless motor I did have issue in
the<00:01:17.740> test<00:01:18.009> run<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.369> stripped<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> idler<00:01:19.119> gear

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
the test run it stripped the idler gear

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.060 
the test run it stripped the idler gear
so<00:01:19.899> I've<00:01:19.990> now<00:01:20.140> replaced<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.680> one<00:01:20.890> with<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so I've now replaced that one with the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.410 
so I've now replaced that one with the
metal<00:01:21.369> one<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.640> would<00:01:21.759> go<00:01:21.880> ahead<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.119> replace

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
metal one I would go ahead and replace

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.930 
metal one I would go ahead and replace
that<00:01:22.860> before<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.039> even<00:01:24.310> put<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.789> there

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
that before you even put this in there

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that before you even put this in there
just<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.179> you<00:01:25.300> don't<00:01:25.360> have<00:01:25.539> to<00:01:25.659> mess<00:01:25.810> with

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
just so you don't have to mess with

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.290 
just so you don't have to mess with
cleaning<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> out<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.550> little<00:01:27.729> pieces<00:01:27.909> I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
cleaning it out all the little pieces I

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.090 
cleaning it out all the little pieces I
am<00:01:28.690> running<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:29.080> lipo<00:01:29.409> battery<00:01:29.740> which<00:01:29.950> is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
am running a lipo battery which is

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.130 
am running a lipo battery which is
different<00:01:30.429> than<00:01:30.490> my<00:01:30.819> test<00:01:31.690> run<00:01:31.869> over<00:01:32.050> a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
different than my test run over a

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350 
different than my test run over a
previous<00:01:32.530> run<00:01:32.710> also<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.880> that<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.119> going<00:01:34.300> to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
previous run also so that is going to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.169 
previous run also so that is going to
give<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.600> some<00:01:34.630> more<00:01:34.810> power<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.130> thing<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
give it some more power the thing is a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.370 
give it some more power the thing is a
totally<00:01:37.509> different<00:01:37.810> truck<00:01:38.020> with<00:01:38.229> this

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
totally different truck with this

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.320 
totally different truck with this
brushless<00:01:38.950> motor<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.399> there<00:01:39.520> anyways<00:01:40.149> I'll

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
brushless motor on there anyways I'll

00:01:40.330 --> 00:02:00.460 
brushless motor on there anyways I'll
just<00:01:40.450> let<00:01:40.569> you<00:01:40.630> see<00:01:40.840> what<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.049> looks<00:01:41.200> like

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.930 

as<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:01.620> can<00:02:01.770> tell<00:02:02.010> there's<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.370> big<00:02:02.640> difference

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
as you can tell there's a big difference

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.679 
as you can tell there's a big difference
in<00:02:03.300> speed

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.109 

if<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.519> front<00:02:08.789> wheel<00:02:08.940> will

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if I just get on it the front wheel will

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.740 
if I just get on it the front wheel will
come<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.810> it'll<00:02:09.899> spin<00:02:10.259> tires<00:02:11.750> totally

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
come up or it'll spin tires totally

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.300 
come up or it'll spin tires totally
different<00:02:13.140> than<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.709> truck<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.190> I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
different than the truck that I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.670 
different than the truck that I
previously<00:02:14.580> had<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:16.019> changed<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
previously had I have changed it a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.050 
previously had I have changed it a
little<00:02:16.890> bit<00:02:17.040> whenever<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.370> replaced<00:02:17.790> all<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
little bit whenever I replaced all the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.300 
little bit whenever I replaced all the
gears<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.900> seems<00:02:19.170> now<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
gears it seems now that it's not one to

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.770 
gears it seems now that it's not one to
pop<00:02:20.519> wheelies<00:02:20.879> all<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> time<00:02:21.360> which<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.720> very

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
pop wheelies all the time which is very

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
pop wheelies all the time which is very
nice<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.379> gives<00:02:22.560> me<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> little<00:02:22.890> bit<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.220> top

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
nice it gives me a little bit more top

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
nice it gives me a little bit more top
in<00:02:23.840> anyway<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.019> thought<00:02:25.140> I'd<00:02:25.319> give<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
