mine<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.380> 5/8<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.420> did<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.960> my

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
mine was 5/8 and I just did this on my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
mine was 5/8 and I just did this on my
drill<00:01:10.320> press<00:01:11.210> spent<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.600> getting

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
drill press spent a lot of time getting

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.800 
drill press spent a lot of time getting
it<00:01:12.900> lined<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.260> making<00:01:13.530> sure<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> worked<00:01:14.040> great

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
it lined up making sure it worked great

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
it lined up making sure it worked great
now<00:01:15.810> changing<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> belts<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.250> easy

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
now changing the belts is really easy

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.300 
now changing the belts is really easy
this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.240> ghetto<00:01:19.080> tensioning<00:01:19.710> device<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this is my ghetto tensioning device it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.170 
this is my ghetto tensioning device it
actually<00:01:20.340> works<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.850> loosen

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actually works really well so we loosen

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
actually works really well so we loosen
it<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:24.960> let's<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> go

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it up and then let's say we want to go

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.060 
it up and then let's say we want to go
to<00:01:26.040> our<00:01:26.960> most<00:01:27.960> common<00:01:28.350> speed<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> use

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to our most common speed that I use

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.469 
to our most common speed that I use
which<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:30.079> 25<00:01:31.079> 2700<00:01:31.890> rpm<00:01:32.420> simple<00:01:33.420> as

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
which is about 25 2700 rpm simple as

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:33.940 
which is about 25 2700 rpm simple as
that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.280 
that
and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.409> hands<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
and then I need two hands for this so

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.620 
and then I need two hands for this so
pull<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:42.350> push<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.630> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
pull that up push that right in and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:02:05.550 
pull that up push that right in and
she's<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.790> ready<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.229> fire<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.439> up

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.590 

as<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.430> see<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.759> tracking<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.329> spot-on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
as you can see the tracking is spot-on

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.650 
as you can see the tracking is spot-on
I'm<00:02:08.020> adjusting<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.560> right<00:02:08.679> now

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
I'm adjusting it right now

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.300 
I'm adjusting it right now
yeah

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.850 

dead-even<00:02:18.910> good<00:02:19.810> stuff

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
dead-even good stuff

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.380 
dead-even good stuff
it'll<00:02:22.860> go<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> lot<00:02:23.190> faster<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.820> it'll<00:02:24.030> go<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> lot

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
it'll go a lot faster and it'll go a lot

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.100 
it'll go a lot faster and it'll go a lot
slower<00:02:24.780> too<00:02:25.170> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> awesome<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
slower too which is awesome this is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.440 
slower too which is awesome this is
pretty<00:02:28.290> much<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> must-do<00:02:28.950> mod<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:30.030> personally

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
pretty much a must-do mod it personally

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.120 
pretty much a must-do mod it personally
cost<00:02:30.660> me<00:02:30.900> about<00:02:30.990> ten<00:02:31.320> dollars<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
cost me about ten dollars because I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.290 
cost me about ten dollars because I
already<00:02:32.430> had<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.640> motor<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.350> these<00:02:34.350> pulleys

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
already had the motor and these pulleys

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.170 
already had the motor and these pulleys
this<00:02:36.300> pulley<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.440> these<00:02:37.830> pulleys<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.550> this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
this pulley and these pulleys and this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
this pulley and these pulleys and this
belt<00:02:39.390> already<00:02:39.630> had<00:02:39.840> laying<00:02:40.020> around<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
belt already had laying around and the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.040 
belt already had laying around and the
wiring<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.370> well<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.540> had<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.720> weld<00:02:42.900> up

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
wiring as well so I just had to weld up

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.050 
wiring as well so I just had to weld up
this<00:02:43.740> which<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.460> quarter-inch<00:02:45.000> thick

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
this which is just quarter-inch thick

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.630 
this which is just quarter-inch thick
plate<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.200> getting<00:02:46.410> too<00:02:46.560> verbose<00:02:46.950> but

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
plate now I'm getting too verbose but

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.370 
plate now I'm getting too verbose but
the<00:02:47.730> point<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:49.170> makes

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
the point is is that this really makes

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.370 
the point is is that this really makes
this<00:02:49.590> grinder<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.310> whole<00:02:51.030> lot<00:02:51.420> better<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
this grinder a whole lot better the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.740 
this grinder a whole lot better the
difference<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.980> night<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.400> day<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.820> if<00:02:54.630> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
difference is night and day and if you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.110 
difference is night and day and if you
have<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.020> time<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:56.190> scrounge<00:02:56.460> around<00:02:56.700> for

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
have the time to scrounge around for

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.750 
have the time to scrounge around for
some<00:02:57.270> parts<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.960> modification

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
some parts to do this modification

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.250 
some parts to do this modification
definitely<00:02:59.760> do<00:02:59.940> it<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.750> only<00:03:00.960> thing<00:03:01.140> I'm

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
definitely do it the only thing I'm

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.230 
definitely do it the only thing I'm
going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> say<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.980> you're<00:03:02.820> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> want<00:03:03.180> to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
going to say is you're going to want to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.020 
going to say is you're going to want to
unplug<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.980> because<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.670> doesn't<00:03:05.970> get

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
unplug this because this doesn't get

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.780 
unplug this because this doesn't get
used<00:03:06.240> anymore<00:03:07.070> except<00:03:08.070> for<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.280> transfer

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
used anymore except for the transfer

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.390 
used anymore except for the transfer
power<00:03:09.000> from<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:10.530> motor<00:03:10.800> over<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:11.190> through

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
power from this motor over here through

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.310 
power from this motor over here through
the<00:03:11.460> belts<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.390> use<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.720> shaft<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.170> motor

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the belts just use the shaft the motor

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.990 
the belts just use the shaft the motor
itself<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.800> not<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.040> use<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.760> you're<00:03:14.850> going<00:03:14.970> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
itself is not in use and you're going to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.420 
itself is not in use and you're going to
want<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.210> coil<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.660> your<00:03:15.810> plug<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.430> you're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
want to coil up your plug and you're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.560 
want to coil up your plug and you're
also<00:03:17.610> going<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.880> want<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.330> put<00:03:18.540> some

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
also going to want to put some

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.830 
also going to want to put some
electrical<00:03:19.500> tape<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.580> end<00:03:20.730> because<00:03:21.360> I'm

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
electrical tape on the end because I'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.110 
electrical tape on the end because I'm
not<00:03:21.990> positive<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.740> this<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.370> I'm<00:03:23.850> pretty

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
not positive about this but I'm pretty

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880 
not positive about this but I'm pretty
sure<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.750> have<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.990> put<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> multimeter<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.680> it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
sure you have to put a multimeter on it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.170 
sure you have to put a multimeter on it
and<00:03:26.040> pretty<00:03:26.160> sure<00:03:26.370> there's<00:03:26.550> AC<00:03:26.700> current

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and pretty sure there's AC current

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.920 
and pretty sure there's AC current
coming<00:03:27.390> out<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.690> there

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
coming out of there

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.930 
coming out of there
well<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.590> current<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.130> there's<00:03:29.280> AC<00:03:29.430> voltage

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
well not current but there's AC voltage

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.420 
well not current but there's AC voltage
there<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.450> setup<00:03:34.430> definitely

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
there so that is the setup definitely

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.410 
there so that is the setup definitely
worth<00:03:35.640> doing<00:03:36.710> take<00:03:37.710> some<00:03:37.950> time<00:03:38.210> the<00:03:39.210> cool

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
worth doing take some time the cool

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.850 
worth doing take some time the cool
thing<00:03:39.600> about<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.930> little<00:03:40.080> grinder<00:03:40.470> build<00:03:40.680> is

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
thing about this little grinder build is

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.140 
thing about this little grinder build is
you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.100> be<00:03:41.190> building<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.640> without<00:03:41.940> really

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
you can be building it without really

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.910 
you can be building it without really
taking<00:03:42.540> down<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.690> grinder<00:03:43.200> because<00:03:43.470> all<00:03:43.650> I
