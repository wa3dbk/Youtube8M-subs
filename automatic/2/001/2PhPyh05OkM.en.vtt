00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.760
 budget smartphone is not always terrible 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.760
 lenovo's smartphone never gets tired 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.260
 prove this theory in practice 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.380
 I welcome you friends with you project 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.249
 company com and i'm Sergey mihailov today we 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 get acquainted with lenovo a800 8 that 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:29.039
 we will begin with a crusher of stereotypes 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 according to tradition, let's start with the exterior of the body 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.560
 the gadget is completely made of plastic 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 the only exception is the front 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.170
 the panel is covered with tempered glass 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 oleophobic coating no faces and ends 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 molded from glossy plastic in principle 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.990
 looks nice but practicality here 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.320
 and stutter is not worth scratching you 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.820
 can hardly get on the first day 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 use that's why we 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.890
 strongly recommend you to spend money 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.890
 also on some protective case 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 assembly and fitting components are very 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.979
 good despite the fact that the device has 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
 collapsible design, he does not publish 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 creaking even with very strong 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.430
 squeezing the ergonomics of the device is not 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.860
 brings no surprises if you already 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.620
 have experience with smartphones 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.260
 possessing five inch displays or 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.330
 so you will most likely be easily 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.210
 find a common language with this device 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.510
 since we touched on the screen issue 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 let's talk about it lenovo a800 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.799
 8 is equipped with a 5 inch ips matrix with 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.049
 people with perfect vision see here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.090
 graininess on 1 2 but I want you 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.030
 frankly to say that this property 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.909
 display ceases to spoil the mood already 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.820
 an hour and a half later the use of the gadget 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.250
 to the viewing angles of this screen claims 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.290
 no inversion only occurs when 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.960
 critical slopes that basically 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.380
 characteristic of the vast majority not 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.189
 the most expensive and ps panels 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.129
 automatic brightness control 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.959
 the screen is present and it pleases 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.930
 and that's what saddens it so 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.680
 maximum backlight intensity she 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.109
 could be much more 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.659
 high in the sun this display 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.359
 shows itself far from the best 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.269
 side camera device represented 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.069
 13 megapixel sensor that can 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.790
 create a pretty good one 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.980
 photos in good light 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.560
 shooting in moderate light as a rule 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.870
 not so bright amount of noise 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.049
 are rising before our eyes but still not 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.950
 Going beyond the limits of propriety video apparatus 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.290
 writes in 1080p quality is above average 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.049
 say anything else to his address not 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.260
 it turns out videos like videos 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.659
 the sound of the device through the headphones is not enough 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.060
 noteworthy to advanced level 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.879
 audio players are far away from him 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 glad that the device is provided 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.099
 equalizer which will help partially 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.590
 brighten this picture on the other hand not 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.109
 the most angled music lovers and this 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.599
 saturation level and sound will be more 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.750
 rather than a multimedia speaker 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.209
 set here medium quality sings 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.819
 he is relatively loud but not very 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.459
 melodious and also slightly wheezy 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.609
 I remember at maximum volume 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.739
 that its main function is 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.439
 notification of the owner of the incoming 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.010
 calls and notifications with this task 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.329
 this speaker copes with a bang 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.849
 hardware platform device 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.530
 represented by an 8-core processor from 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:49.409
 mediatek mt6592 with a working frequency of 1 and 7 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.389
 gigahertz video accelerator mali 450 mp4 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:55.540
 internal memory 16 gigabytes with 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:58.180
 the possibility of expanding operational 2 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.449
 gigabyte that's a lot like for a state employee 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.609
 such iron copes very well with 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.979
 performing everyday tasks in 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.590
 The smartphone does not tupit not moments paging 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:11.709
 the interface is not when drawing beautiful 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.580
 modern toys gta san andreas we 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.459
 on this device nick 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.010
 but hits like asphalt 8 or real 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.620
 racing 3 here go very smoothly and 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.260
 no slowdowns on high graphics 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.100
 that as for me is very worthy 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.280
 the result 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.830
 antutu benchmark also decided not to cheat 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.830
 this machine conditional parrots i 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.020
 I think this is a good result. How are you 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.990
 it seems under heavy loads 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.760
 device heats up but not 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.070
 demonstrates inadequate temperature 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.230
 maximums of the arm of most of his 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.780
 potential buyers will not 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.330

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.020

 gadget autonomy does not catch stars with 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.030

 moderate use cant tell 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.890
 that this is creepy as little but would like 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.510
 larger software component 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.960
 the gadget is represented by an operating 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.360

 redesigned core same 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.750
 functional features left without 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.630
 changes here we have quite good

 switches and support multiple 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.140
 gestures I personally most of all from their 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.450
 numbers pleases shake log which allows 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.970

 lenovo a800 8-ki asking about 170 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.090
 us dollars as for me it is more than 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.300
 adequate price for such a device 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.560
 what is a good iron 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.050
 relatively fresh software 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.229
 the platform is a good camera and quite 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.810
 I assume the sane display with reservation 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.940
 the price tag for this device can be forgiven 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.090
 not very expressive appearance and 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.280
 mediocre musical possibilities 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.590
 among the critical flaws remains 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.710
 only far from record lifetime 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.900
 gadget from a single charge although possible 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.570
 not the most whimsical user and 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.389
 this level of autonomy will be more 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.910
