actually they were kind of scared of the
grass<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.790> first<00:02:24.060> because<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.600> grew<00:02:25.260> pretty

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
grass at first because it grew pretty

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.370 
grass at first because it grew pretty
high<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.330> they<00:02:27.510> didn't<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.320> what

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
high and so they didn't really know what

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.950 
high and so they didn't really know what
but<00:02:29.980> yeah<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:31.600> they<00:02:31.810> are

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
but yeah I really like these they are

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960 
but yeah I really like these they are
really<00:02:32.320> not<00:02:32.440> expensive<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.640> totally

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
really not expensive and you can totally

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.260 
really not expensive and you can totally
get<00:02:34.300> them<00:02:34.540> even<00:02:35.170> cheaper<00:02:35.860> if<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.970> get

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
get them even cheaper if you just get

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.710 
get them even cheaper if you just get
grass<00:02:37.690> seeds<00:02:38.020> from<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.490> garden<00:02:40.300> center<00:02:40.660> or

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
grass seeds from a garden center or

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.070 
grass seeds from a garden center or
whatever<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:41.890> just<00:02:42.100> plant<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.520> yourself

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
whatever and then just plant it yourself

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.050 
whatever and then just plant it yourself
and<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.320> one<00:02:44.530> was<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:46.030> year<00:02:46.270> old<00:02:46.709> 39<00:02:48.060> the

man<00:05:27.599> tablets<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:28.139> freedom<00:05:28.439> room<00:05:28.620> really

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
man tablets and freedom room really

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.730 
man tablets and freedom room really
really<00:05:29.310> small<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.000> they<00:05:30.870> had<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.319> much<00:05:31.530> fun

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740

really small and they had so much fun
with<00:05:31.919> this<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.219> I<00:05:32.370> think<00:05:32.639> these<00:05:32.729> four<00:05:33.000> colors

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
with this and I think these four colors

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240 
with this and I think these four colors
are<00:05:33.479> just<00:05:33.539> really<00:05:33.930> great<00:05:34.229> for<00:05:34.860> their<00:05:35.009> nails

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
are just really great for their nails

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.550 
are just really great for their nails
and<00:05:35.550> also<00:05:36.090> just<00:05:36.240> for<00:05:36.509> I<00:05:36.840> don't<00:05:37.050> know<00:05:37.199> they<00:05:37.379> look

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
and also just for I don't know they look

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.499 
and also just for I don't know they look
kind<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.949> dark<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.430> cozy<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:39.419> I

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
kind of dark and cozy and I think I

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.179 
kind of dark and cozy and I think I
really<00:05:39.840> like<00:05:40.020> these<00:05:40.199> and<00:05:40.469> also<00:05:40.830> they<00:05:40.979> can

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
really like these and also they can

nibble on it

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.980 
nibble on it
the<00:05:42.210> part-timer<00:05:43.939> 1099<00:05:44.939> which<00:05:45.330> i<00:05:45.509> think<00:05:45.569> is

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
the part-timer 1099 which i think is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.399 
the part-timer 1099 which i think is
kind<00:05:46.409> of<00:05:46.590> expensive<00:05:47.340> for<00:05:48.080> something<00:05:49.080> that<00:05:49.259> she

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
kind of expensive for something that she

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.320 
kind of expensive for something that she
could<00:05:49.560> probably<00:05:49.800> get<00:05:50.219> in<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.490> forest<00:05:50.969> and<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
could probably get in the forest and the

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.510 
could probably get in the forest and the
