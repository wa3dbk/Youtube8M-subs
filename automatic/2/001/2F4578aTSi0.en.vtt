00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.880
 mineral 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.980
 I've been thinking for a long time 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
 in on the mountain I say it once 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.539
 that the best thing that goes up there those 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.610
 years are full of crickets 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.230
 the paracos are on the mountain tee 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 closing the way to the whole world 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.080
 they are trying to kill those bandits 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.080
 of hunger 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.420
 and because he trusts him so much 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.500
 is sent friends 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.690
 I've heard a gringo who gets into 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
 a camp of those and give it back 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.450
 have you gone again to Martin 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.430
 I went there in a shelter 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.290
 those those bandits have never 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.510
 respected in life no one 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 you think you are going to start now what 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.210
 are using our last is that the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.800
 guerrilla makes fun of us the fight 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.800
 for this mountain ends today 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.920
 the people we both say 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.680
 they have faces and names but now my 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.780
 people will do it my family has not wavered 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 those bastards have not done in a 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.390
 fuck to stop this we have to pay 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 already take into account that this war is 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 ending everyone 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.040
 a few have been commissioned 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.620
 and instruct this country 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.620
 because it's not possible that for a few 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.799
 be restored
