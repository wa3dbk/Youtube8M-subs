00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello dear friends with you I am Yuri 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.120
 axenov and today I want to tell you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 about the new game and the warhammer universe under 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 Name warhammer quest I 'll probably start 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.059
 your story with the fact that this game 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 based on the desktop of the same name 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 Recently, a lot of desktop 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 games are not transferred to mobile platforms 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 so long ago went to the table to pro 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.539
 witch and all numerous 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.699
 collectible card games can 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 carry developers here sometimes 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.500
 fully tolerate gameplay and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 all the rules of the game and sometimes simplify it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 one touch arcade 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 if you recall for example the popular 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.910
 the card game magic is electronic 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.660
 The version can quite replace to itself 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.000
 original 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 as for the warhammer quest and here everything 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 it was greatly simplified this of course 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 his one touch arcade 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.010
 but not a complete warhammer desktop 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.649
 The quest is very much like a bagel and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.079
 You probably now say that bagels 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 all came from on the table ok and of course 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.059
 You will be right in the game you are given 4 heroes 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 for them we will play the rest 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 Heroes can only be unlocked for 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 account in-game purchases and it is very 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.860
 a strange move because the game is paid 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.510
 developers are asking us for more 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.729
 money for the heroes in the game we will 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.369
 travel around the map to visit cities 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.860
 do quests to fight goblins 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 spiders and other hostile 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.479
 characters in the city we can visit 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 merchant in his shop can be carried out 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 purchase and sale of various items 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 also in the city you can train your 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.729
 heroes and give them their inventory 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 main gameplay is from 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 yourself something like a turn-based strategy 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.420
 mixed with a bagel we wander around 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 dungeons move between rooms 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 and itâ€™s all step by step naturally 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.210
 in some rooms we will 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.400
 face enemies and until we 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 overwhelming them 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.060
 every hero will have his own 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 features hurt can fight 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.649
 only in melee the archer can 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 attack when they are and near targets 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.149
 and the magician, in addition to blows, can apply 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 spell and of course for everyone 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.950
 character can apply different 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.140
 potions and bandages in the game is very important 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.030
 correctly arrange your heroes because 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.219
 that narrow dungeons are present 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 corridors and you just simply can 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.239
 block a move by some of your hero 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.520
 and eventually because of this stay in 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.930
 a loss if the game didn't matter 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 battle tactics 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.159
 it could immediately be said that the game 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.290
 nothing to do and do not shoot this review 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.510
 tactic is the only thing that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.959
 really saves and pulls the gameplay 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 games 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.099
 another interesting points of the game 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.739
 is unpredictable sitting like that 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.989
 you win and suddenly your troops surround 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.299
 enemy arrivals arrived here 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.700
 of course your joy comes to an end and 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.769
 begins the real batch in 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.019
 which one wrong move can cost 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.359
 victories graphically by mobile standards 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.879
 the game looks good i would even say 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.099
 very good but monotonous corridors and 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.590
 dungeons eventually become boring 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.540
 but on the voice acting in the game stingy but I 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.489
 I think that this is a small problem because 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 most generally play on mobile 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.079
 devices muted Well 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.120
 let's move on to the conclusions of the rule on 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.099
 compared to the desktop very simplified 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 so deal with the game and 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.810
 to penetrate it very easily for example 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.790
 Witcher rules were too difficult and 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.010
 many did not play it exactly 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.019
 due to misunderstanding on the other hand 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.810
 this simplicity was bad for 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.620
 storyline and general gaming experiences 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.720
 process 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.000
 the game was dry and boring 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.220
 monotonous yet board games on 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.989
 then board to get together with 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.479
 friends in the evening and enjoy 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.579
 time on the mobile interpretation on the table 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.620
 ok this is in my opinion an attempt of self-serving 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.449
 developers to cash in on fans 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.109
 this is probably all thank you all for 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.970
 viewing 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.280

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.530
