outside of our I all the way into the
inner<00:01:46.930> corner<00:01:47.410> just<00:01:47.649> because<00:01:47.950> that's<00:01:48.430> just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
inner corner just because that's just

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
the way that I decided to do this look

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.410 
the way that I decided to do this look
and<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:51.100> really<00:01:51.369> want<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.670> buff<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.210> there

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and we really want to buff that in there

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.090 
and we really want to buff that in there
so<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.750> take<00:01:52.960> your<00:01:52.990> time<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.350> blend<00:01:53.860> away

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and this is more of a pointed blending

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.499 
and this is more of a pointed blending
brush<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.220> goes<00:02:00.430> perfectly<00:02:00.729> into<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
brush so it goes perfectly into the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.580 
brush so it goes perfectly into the
crease<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:01.869> I'm<00:02:01.960> just<00:02:02.110> going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.289> work<00:02:02.410> it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
again all the way from the inner corner

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.969 
again all the way from the inner corner
all<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.509> way<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.930> out<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.440> just<00:02:05.710> really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.479 
get it into that crease and this brush
helps<00:02:07.930> with<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.259> position<00:02:08.769> of<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.039> which<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
helps with the position of that which I

forth and kind of blend it upward a
little<00:02:39.130> bit<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:40.660> really<00:02:40.870> good<00:02:41.110> for

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
little bit and it's just really good for

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.509 
little bit and it's just really good for
that<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.530> crazy<00:02:41.829> because<00:02:42.070> it's<00:02:42.340> like<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
that it's crazy because it's like a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.310 
that it's crazy because it's like a
shader<00:02:42.820> brush<00:02:42.910> but<00:02:43.329> it<00:02:43.450> still<00:02:43.690> helps<00:02:43.930> blend

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
shader brush but it still helps blend

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.780 
shader brush but it still helps blend
product<00:02:44.829> out

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.979

the<00:03:32.189> color<00:03:32.370> 30m<00:03:32.999> and<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.840> am<00:03:34.019> using<00:03:34.469> a<00:03:34.560> morphe

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
the color 30m and I am using a morphe

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
the color 30m and I am using a morphe
brush<00:03:35.159> and<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.700> e3<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.480> is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
brush and this is the e3 and this is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.239 
brush and this is the e3 and this is
probably<00:03:36.780> one<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.349> softest<00:03:37.769> brushes<00:03:38.099> I've

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:38.249 
probably one of the softest brushes I've

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.039 
probably one of the softest brushes I've
ever<00:03:38.459> used<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:38.849> life<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.569> pointed

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
ever used in my life and it is pointed

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.229 
ever used in my life and it is pointed
so<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.319> does<00:03:40.469> help<00:03:40.709> with<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.980> contour<00:03:41.519> concept

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
so it does help with the contour concept

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.190 
so it does help with the contour concept
a<00:03:42.329> little<00:03:42.420> bit<00:03:42.659> but<00:03:42.780> I'm<00:03:42.900> not<00:03:43.079> really
