space this is probably my biggest issue
with<00:01:40.959> organizing<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:41.679> whole<00:01:41.889> thing<00:01:42.039> is

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
with organizing this whole thing is

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.949 
with organizing this whole thing is
because<00:01:42.609> you<00:01:42.759> definitely<00:01:42.909> with<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.599> small

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
because you definitely with a small

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.899 
because you definitely with a small
closet<00:01:44.139> need<00:01:44.499> to<00:01:44.619> make<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:45.249> most<00:01:45.520> juice<00:01:45.759> of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
closet need to make the most juice of

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.789 
closet need to make the most juice of
all<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.149> space<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.389> you<00:01:46.630> do<00:01:46.840> have<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.679> the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
all the space that you do have so the

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.589 
all the space that you do have so the
first<00:01:47.979> thing<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.279> suggest<00:01:48.700> obviously<00:01:49.509> the

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
first thing I suggest obviously the

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.940 
first thing I suggest obviously the
first<00:01:49.719> thing<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:49.990> did<00:01:50.139> is<00:01:50.289> I<00:01:50.380> took<00:01:50.409> all<00:01:50.740> my

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
first thing I did is I took all my

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.830 
first thing I did is I took all my
clothes<00:01:51.249> out<00:01:51.459> of<00:01:51.700> my<00:01:51.909> closets<00:01:52.329> I<00:01:52.450> find<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:52.779> a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
clothes out of my closets I find it's a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.179 
clothes out of my closets I find it's a
lot<00:01:53.020> easier<00:01:53.049> if<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.439> actually<00:01:53.590> start<00:01:53.979> with<00:01:54.130> a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
lot easier if you actually start with a

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.129 
lot easier if you actually start with a
blank<00:01:54.340> slate<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.599> then<00:01:55.749> you<00:01:55.840> can<00:01:55.959> start

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
blank slate and then you can start

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.929 
blank slate and then you can start
putting<00:01:56.349> the<00:01:56.529> clothes<00:01:56.770> slowly<00:01:57.249> back<00:01:57.549> in<00:01:57.729> and

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
putting the clothes slowly back in and

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.909 
putting the clothes slowly back in and
organizing<00:01:58.450> them<00:01:58.569> how<00:01:58.779> you<00:01:58.810> want<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.799> the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:01:59.919 
organizing them how you want so the

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.409 
organizing them how you want so the
first<00:02:00.069> thing<00:02:00.249> that<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.759> need<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.239> I<00:02:01.299> would

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:01.419 
first thing that you need and I would

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.629
