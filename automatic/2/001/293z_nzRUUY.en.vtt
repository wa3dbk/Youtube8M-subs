burners such as this is right here can
they<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.090> adjusted<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.840> different<00:00:21.410> inputs<00:00:22.410> gas

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
they be adjusted to different inputs gas

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
they be adjusted to different inputs gas
inlets<00:00:23.520> well<00:00:23.700> certainly<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.270> they<00:00:24.660> have

inlets well certainly they can they have

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.769 
inlets well certainly they can they have
a<00:00:24.810> gas<00:00:24.990> fellow<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.529> anything<00:00:25.920> else<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.779> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
a gas fellow like anything else and you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
a gas fellow like anything else and you
can<00:00:28.169> on<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> them<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.310> don't<00:00:29.369> believe<00:00:29.730> you

at<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.379> very<00:00:37.650> low<00:00:38.809> flow<00:00:39.809> rate<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.949> about<00:00:41.760> one

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
at a very low flow rate and about one

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.380 
at a very low flow rate and about one
inch<00:00:42.390> water<00:00:43.110> column<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.970> will<00:00:45.059> look<00:00:45.239> at

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
inch water column and it will look at

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.509 
inch water column and it will look at
the<00:00:45.510> flame<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> we'll<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.769> what<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.040> does<00:00:47.070> as

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
the flame and we'll see what it does as

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.289 
the flame and we'll see what it does as
we<00:00:47.699> increase<00:00:49.309> okay<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.549> we're<00:00:50.699> showing<00:00:51.030> the

we increase okay here we're showing the
burner<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.900> about<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.309> inch<00:00:54.110> water<00:00:55.110> column

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
burner and about one inch water column

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:09.250 
burner and about one inch water column
manifold<00:00:56.100> pressure<00:00:56.430> pretty<00:00:57.269> small<00:00:57.570> flame

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.260 

okay<00:01:09.860> we're<00:01:10.220> up<00:01:10.400> bound<00:01:10.910> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:33.660 

three

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.820 

about<00:01:34.420> three<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.870> half

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:51.780 

or

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.740 

it's<00:01:52.150> about<00:01:52.330> as<00:01:52.480> high<00:01:52.690> as<00:01:52.720> it'll<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:53.710> it's<00:01:54.750> 4.6

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
it's about as high as it'll go it's 4.6

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's about as high as it'll go it's 4.6
I'll<00:01:56.620> give<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> BTU<00:01:57.370> input<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.330> thing

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
I'll give you a BTU input on that thing

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.280 
I'll give you a BTU input on that thing
-<00:01:59.910> okay<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.090> little<00:02:01.240> fire<00:02:01.570> now<00:02:01.870> is<00:02:02.050> about

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
- okay the little fire now is about

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.330 
- okay the little fire now is about
50,000<00:02:03.250> BTUs<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:05.020> burger<00:02:05.470> here<00:02:05.890> now<00:02:06.070> it's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
50,000 BTUs this burger here now it's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.730 
50,000 BTUs this burger here now it's
running<00:02:06.610> right<00:02:07.000> at<00:02:08.250> 240<00:02:09.250> thousand<00:02:09.760> BTUs<00:02:10.740> so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
running right at 240 thousand BTUs so

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.880 
running right at 240 thousand BTUs so
that's<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.160> difference<00:02:12.460> in<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> fire
