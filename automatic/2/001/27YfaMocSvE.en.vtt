 The graphic is hardly from the original

 background the previously available

 The future was long in the future 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.519
 interesting is also minecraft 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.989
 inventor markus persson such plans 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.629
 opposed in the past 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.060
 did before he minecraft for 25 billion 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.489
 dollar to microsoft sold since part 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.980
 the microsoft in september 2012 via 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.720
 twitter a clear cancellation as 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.970
 the company had offered him 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.310
 to certify minecraft for windows 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.319
 we do not expect the 110 edition 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.540
 replace the current pc 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.060
 but rather another variant 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.410
 the pocket edition will only be 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.049
 for pc news about the 1.9 in the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.060
 future version 1.9 should be under 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.129
 other shields with double handling 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.410
 be included with those of the combat system 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.480
 to be spiced up in minecraft 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.760
 Double handling means yours 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 Blocks Bauer in minecraft not anymore 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.569
 only one weapon in the right hand 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.730
 can wear but a second in 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.560
 the left left hander should also the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.030
 possibility still be given 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.470
 not more with her virtual 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.940
 to be able to identify 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.169
 and of course I speak 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.810
 experience because I am personally 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.909
 left-handed were also other features 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.709
 on the grain this announced 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.780
 include, among others, enchanted and 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.889
 advanced arrows such as 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.039
 poison arrows 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.020
 spectral file and beacon latter 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.419
 give you the opportunity and enemy 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.919
 to mark and track more easily 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.020
 you have yourself in minecraft 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.860
 the game will bring you this soon 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.259
 Show 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.419
 positive effects should be on the upper 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.830
 side of the screen more negative on the screen 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.810
 shown below 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.580
 the end will be much bigger, too 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.379
 land mass to be discovered 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.969
 so that you are no longer just the ender 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.979
 kites and then again 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.289
 this could include the 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.240
 was the lot of jumping talent 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.889
 calls for exploration 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.469
 In addition, a new opponent will move 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.479
 keep the Schalke similar to skeletons 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.279
 he can shoot you with projectiles 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.539
 which let you float that 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:03.389
 sneaky at him 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.099
 he disguises himself as flop loudly building servants 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.659
 should the first snapshots for 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.669
 so-called completely update the 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.270
 coming weeks will appear as it is 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.370
 curious; excited 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.110
 so far the most important information 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.000
 from the mine grain to minecraft like 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.680
