when<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> whole<00:00:42.480> band<00:00:42.690> playing<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
when you have a whole band playing and

you have a keyboardist that's in there

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
you have a keyboardist that's in there
and<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> take<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> keyboard<00:00:47.160> keyboard

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and you take just the keyboard keyboard

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
and you take just the keyboard keyboard
part<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.690> sometimes<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.739> not

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
part out and do it sometimes it's not

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
part out and do it sometimes it's not
satisfying<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> all

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
satisfying because you don't have all

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that the organist is doing mainly it's

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.749 
that the organist is doing mainly it's
it's<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.259> same<00:01:07.470> chords<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> guitar<00:01:08.340> did

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
it's this the same chords the guitar did

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.749 
it's this the same chords the guitar did
but<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> different<00:01:10.740> pattern<00:01:11.130> here's<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
but in a different pattern here's the

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.820 
but in a different pattern here's the
pattern<00:01:12.140> it's<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.410> take<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> little

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
pattern it's going to take a little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.590 
pattern it's going to take a little
technical<00:01:14.310> prowess<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
technical prowess here to do this

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
technical prowess here to do this
because<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.899> is<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.470> easy<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
because this is not so easy you got to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880 
because this is not so easy you got to
be<00:01:18.780> poured<00:01:19.050> in<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> you've<00:01:19.649> already<00:01:19.770> got

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
be poured in here so you've already got

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.290 
be poured in here so you've already got
the<00:01:20.070> guitar<00:01:20.190> part<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> assume

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
the guitar part so I'm going to assume

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.969

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
I exaggerated that I exaggerated that

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.059 
I exaggerated that I exaggerated that
motion<00:02:54.110> when<00:02:54.920> I'm<00:02:56.049> practicing<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.890> when

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
motion when I'm practicing so that when

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.670 
motion when I'm practicing so that when
I<00:02:58.099> do<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.780> know<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> performance<00:03:00.500> for

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
I do it you know a performance for

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.680 
I do it you know a performance for
normal<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.819> know<00:03:01.909> kind<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.269> feels<00:03:02.510> more

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
normal it you know kind of feels more

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.690 
normal it you know kind of feels more
natural<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.349> exaggerate<00:03:03.680> something<00:03:04.519> and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
natural if you exaggerate something and

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.009 
natural if you exaggerate something and
then<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.239> go<00:03:05.329> back<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> way<00:03:05.959> you

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
then you go back and do the way you

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.240 
then you go back and do the way you
should<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.409> it<00:03:06.530> then<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.769> feels<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> little<00:03:07.099> more

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
should do it then it feels a little more

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:30.520 
should do it then it feels a little more
comfortable

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:49.930 

maybe<00:03:31.530> addy<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.819> changed<00:03:33.410> 27<00:03:48.860> but

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
maybe addy here that just changed 27 but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.160 
maybe addy here that just changed 27 but
so<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.000> go<00:03:51.299> through<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.510> whole<00:03:51.720> progression

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
so you go through the whole progression

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.650 
so you go through the whole progression
like<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.410> did<00:03:52.530> with<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> guitar<00:03:53.129> but<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.629> it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
like you did with the guitar but do it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.089 
like you did with the guitar but do it
with<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.989> pattern<00:03:57.799> let<00:03:58.799> me<00:03:58.890> show<00:03:59.010> you

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
with that pattern let me show you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:06.280 
with that pattern let me show you
something<00:03:59.400> else<00:03:59.519> the<00:04:01.760> keyboards<00:04:02.760> does<00:04:02.970> here

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.530 

you<00:04:07.290> put<00:04:07.560> right<00:04:07.950> here<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.430> put<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> b-flat<00:04:09.150> in

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
you put right here and put a b-flat in

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150 
you put right here and put a b-flat in
there<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.019> chord<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.829> can<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.069> it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
there with that chord so you can do it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.150 
there with that chord so you can do it
like<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.459> they<00:04:12.060> see<00:04:12.599> me<00:04:12.989> flat<00:04:13.410> yeah<00:04:13.769> makes

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
like this they see me flat yeah makes

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.340 
like this they see me flat yeah makes
another<00:04:14.430> seven<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.780> kind<00:04:16.019> of<00:04:16.079> adds<00:04:16.200> a

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
another seven and that kind of adds a

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:25.800 
another seven and that kind of adds a
little<00:04:16.500> flavor<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.430> core<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:18.030> go

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.150
