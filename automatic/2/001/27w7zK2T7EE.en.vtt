00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.940
 Hello guys 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 I'm a teacher 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.590
 biology of polyhedron today we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.590
 Let's try to be dealing with one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.210
 very delicate subject interesting to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.270
 question of the relationship between evolution and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 fossilization where fossilization is a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 extremely important tool in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.840
 evolutionary study of the good species we 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.090
 we have on the planet the ecosystems of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.670
 planet is totally divided into 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 ecosystems and people know that each 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.970
 ecosystem has a set of 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 biotic and abiotic factors is the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.840
 strong point in our case are the factors 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 abiotic what these factors the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 abiotic factors are all elements 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.430
 who have no life but generate life on the water 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.630
 temperature or heat to humidity at 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.370
 salinity are extremely important elements 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.120
 important because they are going to 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.310
 to direct what the morphology and 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.460
 physiology of species in a 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 certain good geographical area is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.120
 important to point out the following 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.440
 that there is a direct relationship with 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.130
 abiotic factors and the morphology of each 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.820
 to be 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.229
 what morphology morphology is the form 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.500
 each species has a morphology 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.070
 specific morphology associated with their 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.299
 there is also the physiology that is the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.510
 functioning of the body is the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.590
 singular specific operation of 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.220
 each being 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.630
 now let's join the two words 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.659
 morphology and physiology gathering 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.920
 morphophysiology every being on the planet 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.590
 no matter how big your size is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.950
 specific morphology and has 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.989
 a direct relationship between 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.690
 morphology with the influence of 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.810
 abiotic factor 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.450
 a good ecosystem position now 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.330
 entering the question of the fossil 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.660
 the fossil is an important tool 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.860
 because the folio allows us to 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.260
 identify the different species that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 lived at different times over 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.310
 different environmental influences 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.610
 the fossil also shows us a relationship 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.630
 with evolution because some species 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.280
 die and other species last because 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.780
 are the most adapted and these species 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.500
 they then go through an improvement 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.010
 gene that carries this species is a 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.810
 adaptation and greater pressure tolerance 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.020
 good environment 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.800
 palaeontology what paleontology is 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.080
 science studies the ancient being 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.300
 paleontology related to 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.170
 they progress 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.200
 it ties us, they show us that there is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.560
 difference between the old and the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.300
 current paleontology makes us understand 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.470
 the processes that the beings suffered 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:42.170
 when in the old days until 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.570
 Current morphology to palocci 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.890
 paleontology through sites 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.519
 archaeological finds to try to mount the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.540
 profile of each ecosystem in different 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.610
 tries to identify through the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.590
 morphology of each animal 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.630
 even the size of their teeth 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.590
 size of their jaws the size of 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.590
 your chest 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.620
 how were your habits through 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.050
 through the coprolite coprolite are feces 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.320
 petrified a very rich material 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.930
 because I can understand what the 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.670
 food of each animal 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.919
 based on the food that was 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.480
 I found a coprolite I can 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.520
 understand how your food chain was 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.919
 your food web 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.169
 when I evaluate a determined 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.710
 particular archaeological site and 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.890
 I can understand this animal was in 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.750
 migratory route or that animal died in 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.710
 its own habitat then 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.340
 paleontology today is a plot is a 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.130
 tool of utmost importance because 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.430
 through the archaeological sites 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.669
 I can understand the evolutionary process 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.000
 of each species within your 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:08.880
 ecosystem and today has made many 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.040
 studies using tomography is x-ray 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.910
 Carbon-14 cable study which are 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.210
 parallel tools that guide us to 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.900
 question of the age of cister of these beings 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.130
 then the evolution relation what 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.200
 evolution 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.600
 this is an extremely important topic to 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.000
 level of your vestibular mainly 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.970
 which is tied to Darwinian theories 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.669
 where he spoke of the theory of adaptation 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.290
 theory of variability and theory of 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.070
 natural selection 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:45.160
 then paleontology came to together 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.919
 with fossilization precisely so as not to 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.890
 upload information to understand 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.470
 the evolutionary process of each 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.220
 even more personal 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.220
 thank you very much
