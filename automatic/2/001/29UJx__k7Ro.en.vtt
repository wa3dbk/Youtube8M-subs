we've<00:01:23.400> only<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.790> four<00:01:24.390> seconds

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.670 

well<00:01:34.549> Dean<00:01:34.850> very<00:01:35.509> wisely<00:01:35.810> taking<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.470> breather

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
well Dean very wisely taking a breather

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.450 
well Dean very wisely taking a breather
in<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.979> center<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> Ring<00:01:37.549> there<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.340> he

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
in the center of the Ring there and he

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.010 
in the center of the Ring there and he
which<00:01:40.610> part<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.940> him<00:01:41.000> hurts<00:01:41.330> most<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.840> should

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
which part of him hurts most I should

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.380 
which part of him hurts most I should
think<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.250> bruising<00:01:43.670> has<00:01:43.729> been<00:01:43.940> taking

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
think so the bruising has been taking

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.510 
think so the bruising has been taking
but<00:01:45.200> certainly<00:01:45.710> he's<00:01:45.920> now<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> great<00:01:46.369> deal

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
but certainly he's now a great deal

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.249 
but certainly he's now a great deal
better<00:01:46.729> than<00:01:46.820> any<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.180> us<00:01:47.240> expected<00:01:47.299> here<00:01:48.020> this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
better than any of us expected here this

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.550 
better than any of us expected here this

each and if his daddy's watching notice
as<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.350> sure<00:02:09.649> he<00:02:09.679> will<00:02:09.979> be<00:02:10.130> he'll<00:02:10.459> be<00:02:10.580> pleased

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880

00:02:46.560 --> 00:03:08.360 
think this really meant business that
time<00:02:48.440> for<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.620> back<00:03:06.680> there<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:07.920> very<00:03:08.010> much

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
time for the back there it's very much
