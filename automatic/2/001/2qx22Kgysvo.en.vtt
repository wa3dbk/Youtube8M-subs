00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.509
 and almond candy 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 remember that you have the recipe for 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.410
 written and detailed in gluttonous landia 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.410
 dot com 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.270
 hello today we are going to use flour and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.059
 baking powder a little milk 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.670
 sugar also the coin a bit of 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.019
 butter a few raisins and water 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.019
 we were going to make a recipe 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.609
 The first thing we do is beat the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.930
 butter that we have warmed a tad 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.110
 in the microwave so that this medium 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.980
 liquid with the sugar is going to give 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.380
 a little cane 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.110
 once we have it well mixed 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.930
 we add the eggs the system the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.409
 always add and beat quickly to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.140
 that is integrated 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.329
 you see that creame we are good 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.030
 now the next ingredient touches the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.979
 flour that we're going to sift 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.569
 pass it through a colander so big for 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.069
 that we do not get lumps this we 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.490
 guarantees that the texture of our 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.890
 Sweet is perfect and always 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.350
 we add and mix it is better to do it 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.040
 little by little not all at once 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.410
 we also add the yeast 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 and I like to put them also a 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.799
 little piece of salt 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.520
 that enhances the flavors which to me then 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.890
 I'm interested then see nothing to stir a 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.509
 little until the flour is well mixed 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.509
 and yeast evenly 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.920
 and it's already mixed we add the milk and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.290
 I'm too lazy to repeat it but there's 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.570
 to stir again 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 and we have the ingredients of the touch 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.650
 of flavor I add the raisins which I have 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.320
 chopped with a knife to make them 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.080
 smaller pieces prior to this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.940
 for inside 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.700
 and we are going to do the same with the almond 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.550
 milled for inside also this what 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.130
 let's knead until it's well 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.750
 integrated we will have a pretty mass 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.820
 gross 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.190
 as you see we do not get rid of stain 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.940
 but I assure you that it deserves 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.890
 pain 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.410
 you see what mass texture we have left like this 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 like a cookie a bit soft, it's 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.000
 what we are going to use then to 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.350
 our molds you will see how rich 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.720
 and we are going to fill our cupcakes 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.490
 let's see what previously smeared 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.590
 these molds with a little butter 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.380
 it would not be necessary but good always 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.450
 help the overflow and nothing is going 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 filling in try to fill us with the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.680
 all because something will grow in the oven 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.629
 and one after another good I have a little trick 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.780
 I teach you a little hole 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.430
 a slight pressure in the middle so that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.310
 when growing in the oven do it in a way 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.920
 uniform 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.500
 and the oven must be preheated to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.280
 180 degrees we will put it in the part 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.660
 central with heat only from below 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.350
 and after about 18 or 20 minutes we'll have it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.090
 ready and I have them ready well then nothing 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.250
 we take them out but do not unmold them 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.569
 until a few minutes pass because 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.770
 if we do it now they will be of greater 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.960
 hot and that makes us break 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.720
 I like it is to give them a bit of 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.130
 icing sugar above is optional but 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.920
 as they do not carry too much sugar 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.160
 it gives them apart from a nice touch a 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.620
 extra sweetness that I love and 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.780
 here we have them do not tell me you do not know 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.660
 is producing a chocolate coffee or 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.420
 anything where you can wet the and 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.209
 look closely 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.430
 Crispy on the outside soft inside 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.430
 the perfect sweet to enjoy 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.540
