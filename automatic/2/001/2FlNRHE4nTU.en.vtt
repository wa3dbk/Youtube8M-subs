00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
baseball pitchers for exercising the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.049 
baseball pitchers for exercising the
fingers<00:00:13.380> completely<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:14.940> get

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
fingers completely so that you can get

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.109 
fingers completely so that you can get
complete<00:00:15.360> control<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.250> ball<00:00:17.490> during<00:00:17.850> your

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
complete control on the ball during your

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.599 
complete control on the ball during your
grip<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.510> different<00:00:18.840> pitches<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.460> want<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> go

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
grip for different pitches I want to go

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279 
grip for different pitches I want to go
through<00:00:20.820> something<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.390> basic<00:00:21.810> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
through something really basic that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.540 
through something really basic that
seems<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.769> neglected<00:00:23.279> when<00:00:23.369> we're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
seems to be neglected when we're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
seems to be neglected when we're
training<00:00:23.760> pitchers<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.680> strength

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
training pitchers about how the strength

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.710 
training pitchers about how the strength
of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.789> fingers<00:00:27.980> are<00:00:28.980> complex<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> very

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
of the fingers are complex and very

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.150 
of the fingers are complex and very
simply<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.230> developed<00:00:31.619> headmaster<00:00:32.189> plus<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
simply we developed headmaster plus that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
simply we developed headmaster plus that
really<00:00:35.160> appeals<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.790> lot<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.059> different

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
really appeals to a lot of different

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.750 
really appeals to a lot of different
sports<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:36.899> none<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.620> specifically<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.430> for

core of all pictures you can carry it
with<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> wherever<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.020> go<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:56.070> easy<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with you wherever you go very easy to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.700 
with you wherever you go very easy to
train<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.210> complete<00:00:57.600> training<00:00:57.960> now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
train and very complete training now

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.970 
train and very complete training now
rather<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.239> training<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.350> grip<00:01:01.620> side

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
rather just then training the grip side

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
rather just then training the grip side
of<00:01:02.160> things<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:03.030> we're<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> take

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of things like I say we're going to take

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.190 
of things like I say we're going to take
a<00:01:04.080> certain<00:01:04.500> grip<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.100> fingers<00:01:05.549> okay

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
a certain grip with our fingers okay

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
a certain grip with our fingers okay
instead<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.560> training<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.280> grip<00:01:08.760> what

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
instead of just training that grip what

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
instead of just training that grip what
we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.400> train<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
we can do now is we can train the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330 
we can do now is we can train the
muscles<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.450> stabilize<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.770> fingers<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
muscles that stabilize the fingers and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
muscles that stabilize the fingers and
those<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> those<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> finger

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
those are the those are the finger

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
those are the those are the finger
opening<00:01:16.740> muscles<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.909> remember<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
opening muscles because remember the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.080 
opening muscles because remember the
maximum<00:01:19.170> strength<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.970> our

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
maximum strength that we can have in our

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.480 
maximum strength that we can have in our
fingers<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.740> situation<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
fingers is in a situation where the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.450 
fingers is in a situation where the
finger<00:01:23.820> extensor<00:01:24.540> muscles<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> stabilize

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
finger extensor muscles that stabilize

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.819 
finger extensor muscles that stabilize
the<00:01:26.460> grip<00:01:26.700> where<00:01:27.210> they're<00:01:27.420> strong<00:01:27.810> plus<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the grip where they're strong plus the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
the grip where they're strong plus the
flexor<00:01:29.280> muscles<00:01:29.610> are<00:01:29.729> strong<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
flexor muscles are strong and the
