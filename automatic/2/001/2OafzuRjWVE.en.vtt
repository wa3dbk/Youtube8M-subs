00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.029
 in this video I'm going to show you a way 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.049
 super easy original and recycled 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.910
 make a stick or a shovel for I do not know 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.260
 Take to the beach and make castles 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.020
 sand or whatever you want 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.630
 and good is recycling a gallon of milk 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.720
 and the models that we are going to need go 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.310
 To be 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.310
 a toilet of a suitor 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.789
 scissors 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.340
 cutter 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.579
 a down of preference that is 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 permanent and material to decorate good 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.559
 let's start by taking the down 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.649
 and we are going to locate it in the part where 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.750
 there is the claw of the flames of the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.090
 brand 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.840
 of the word the shovel or stick ok as 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.840
 you want me to stay 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.010
 okay 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 you are going to take your cutter 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 and the part where the hip is going to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 cut this part 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 ok so that the real one of the palette 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 and let's start cutting 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.040
 A) Yes 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.200
 and so 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 All this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.280
 then let's start cutting 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.850
 i 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.920
 it's a little complicated 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.220
 good 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 well let's go 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 doing everything 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.899
 let's continue 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.849
 cutting all the contour that we did and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.510
 now when we get to this part 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.069
 we are going to cut that whole part 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.069
 which is that all the claw will 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:31.630
 i 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.960
 this game we're going to cut and I'm going to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.960
 keep cutting 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.670
 A) Yes 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.870
 and well we will wait 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.720
 it's complicated 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.410
 ok almost finishing and that has 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.460
 and we will become the palita 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 obviously you will do it much better 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.970
 that I 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 Well , we will have stayed 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.530
 the beating with gallon of milk 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.050
 exact 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.379
 seriously it's not an ingenious idea and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.440
 well I hope this video has them 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.440

 qualify if you liked this video not 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.980
 forget to like me because the truth is 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.230
 a pretty easy idea 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.909
 and very original good I hope that this 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.610
 video serve them and use it and what 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.370
 put into practice if you do not have a 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.870
 Well, here is the solution and 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.849
 well that was all we see in the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.799
