00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi the most observant subscribers 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.380
 of you must have noticed that 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.180
 I was not bad 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 missing from my string of these 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 time and yes I was on vacation so 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.630
 I did a little tour on the side of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 Bordeaux 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 I thought of you I took some 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.420
 pictures some videos of gear 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
 general car that I could see 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 on the way so here I go you in 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 make it enjoy so it's true that I 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 am not a big fan of photos that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.869
 parade but good at times I have 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 not my camcorder with me so failing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 better here and I specify that here is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 this is the video a little holiday and that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 the tutos the videos all that the real one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.550
 mechanical will resume after the side of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.270
 guerrilla in a citroen constitution 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.309
 I found a 11 slight contraction 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 whose grille and is of type 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 games accessories during this time we 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.850
 was pretty beautiful by a little leak 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 who had under the engine and otherwise nice 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 what do we have here then we 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.960
 are chaille-les-marshes and this is it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.010
 that we find the ford taunus that he would go 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 for sale and that it is not in a very 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.299
 beautiful and to tell the truth I have the impression 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.299
 that she has been here for a few weeks 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.560
 so it's a tonus 12 m 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.480
 I have the impression that there are a lot of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.660
 job 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.260
 even if a little gag it's yes for 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.260
 electric cars 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 I do not think it's electric 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 although never at la rochelle on a 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.730
 parking I saw this old brand or 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.520
 so sorry next game not specialist 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.020
 but I was going to leave the village of 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.700
 saint-emilion when I came across 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.160
 this very beautiful red cabbage is taken 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.280
 in photo as well as this very beautiful 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.760
 stressful hull that was parked there in 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.970
 the street at hourtin I saw this 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.320
 volkswagen type 181 then on the moment 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.240
 I thought it was a tube my mouth 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.880
 in fact I think that's the model 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.580
 that is after is what they can 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.370
 glimpse at a winemaker in the region 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:31.330
 of blaye he dines apart relatively 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.330
 well preserved it is a utility 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.460
 the outfits are rather in good condition but 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.730
 the side it has a little cracked on the cera 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.390
 it's not bad at all even its best 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:06.800
 only on madoff 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:12.260
 in any case there we see the plate of late 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.010
 like what is it utilitarian if we 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 has a door that opens 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.650
 the characteristic smell of plastic 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.650
 hot 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:48.690
 fun detail if I believe this line 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:52.019
 is she is always assured you are 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.230
 asks if it's rolling after all 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.700
 why not but at the same 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:03.450
 vintner tractor massey ferguson 178 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.430
 who I think is not 2010 either 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.450
 or 2011 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.150
 I do not know what year it can 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.819
 to be these gear where it starts to 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.959
 do it for apparently there is 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:23.460
 always operational is always 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:28.040
 job this is his area of ​​work 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.040
 vines vineyards and still vine 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.630
 no 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.450
 and always at this same winemaker's 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.740
 hardware so detractors an old lighthouse 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.090
 wrong and so next to him a mac cormick 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.440
 both of which were used on 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.840
 the exploitation that are now in 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 fact that are part of a small museum 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.290
 museum they organized like that 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.270
 it's pretty cool simple old 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.160
 equipment 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.880
 so this is specified a case from the plan 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.470
 marshall then decidedly I was spoiled 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.960
 at this winemaker since there was 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.270
 also a dyna panhard version 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.270
 sedan that was in the old cellar 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.160
 then seen on a farm 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.950
 agricultural between the herbaria les essarts 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.630
 taxes nor that is to say a massy harris 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.600
 pony 812 of 1956 then in the state I do not 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.650
 do not know if he is able to start 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.780
 she's still a battery cayla 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.280
 on the other hand everything looks pretty rusty 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.500
 is possible that not then obviously 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.070
 it's a gasoline engine what we see there 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:29.550
 the fourth of the lala dynamo starter with 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.940
 the system to engage the pinion 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.940
 starter 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.590
 good there are more seats directions 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.820
 completely blocked I think now 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.770
 he is the front is really 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.770
 story of saying so bad at all the good 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.840
 so here so here we find the 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:04.360
 spark plugs the ignition system with 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.950
 breaker the gas pump so no 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.370
 doubt so it was a motor 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.470
 essence and I think this tractor in 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.610
 party was brought here by the Americans 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.610
 as part of the marshall plan 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:24.040
 Here a collection of piece 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.380
 keep then maybe one day he 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.190
 will be restored I do not know I could not 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.130
 talk with the owners 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.150
 unfortunately bomb with this one on 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.570
 may be able to make a plateau 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.570
 by two cars
