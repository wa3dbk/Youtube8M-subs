then parallel out from the connector on

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.460 
then parallel out from the connector on
the<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.479> side<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.320> actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the other side so you can actually

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.060 
the other side so you can actually
