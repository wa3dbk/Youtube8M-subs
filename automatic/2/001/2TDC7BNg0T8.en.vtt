but can't use it for whatever reason

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.660 
but can't use it for whatever reason
because<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:58.859> neo<00:02:59.069> Queen<00:02:59.250> serenity<00:02:59.310> is

sound wins crystal and tell him and then

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.550 
sound wins crystal and tell him and then
I<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.120> use<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.239> one<00:03:03.540> which<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.049> logic<00:03:04.409> isn't

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560

I can use that one which the logic isn't
really<00:03:04.859> great<00:03:05.129> there<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.609> ok<00:03:06.620> we<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.799> that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
really great there but ok we see that

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.399 
really great there but ok we see that
it's<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.310> fear<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.849> demand<00:03:09.180> mind<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.900> might<00:03:10.290> not

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
it's a fear and demand mind up might not

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.539 
it's a fear and demand mind up might not
be<00:03:10.530> mind<00:03:10.709> controlled<00:03:11.099> like<00:03:11.220> they<00:03:11.340> might<00:03:11.489> have

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
be mind controlled like they might have

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.879 
be mind controlled like they might have
some<00:03:11.819> kind<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.299> secret<00:03:12.599> plan<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.650> way<00:03:13.829> to

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
some kind of like secret plan and way to

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.430 
some kind of like secret plan and way to
get<00:03:14.040> out<00:03:14.129> of<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.340> don't<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.000> know

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
get out of this don't really know

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.050 
get out of this don't really know
otherwise<00:03:16.440> nothing<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.400> happened<00:03:17.819> other

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
otherwise nothing really happened other

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.780 
otherwise nothing really happened other
than<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.690> plot<00:03:19.680> development<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> guess<00:03:20.609> it's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
than that plot development I guess it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.280 
than that plot development I guess it's
a<00:03:20.849> -<00:03:21.090> because<00:03:21.389> there<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.840> black<00:03:22.049> lady

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
a - because there is some black lady

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.939 
a - because there is some black lady

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
Venus is beau which does not colored in

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.580 
Venus is beau which does not colored in
at<00:03:42.299> one<00:03:42.419> point<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.930> whenever<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.349> see<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
at one point and whenever you see the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.289 
at one point and whenever you see the
group<00:03:43.829> like<00:03:44.190> walking<00:03:44.639> or<00:03:44.760> traveling<00:03:45.150> together

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

they<00:03:45.690> always<00:03:45.989> just<00:03:46.019> look<00:03:46.379> kind<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.739> weird

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
they always just look kind of weird

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.559

overall<00:03:49.049> again<00:03:49.470> whatever<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.150> was<00:03:51.329> good

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
overall again whatever I it was good

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.330 
overall again whatever I it was good
enough<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.049> guess<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.470> artwork<00:03:52.980> will<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
enough so I guess this artwork will be a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.300 
enough so I guess this artwork will be a
three<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:54.090> lastly<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:55.109> action<00:03:55.530> nothing

that's<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.549> entire<00:04:14.760> episode<00:04:14.909> and<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.599> guess

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
that's the entire episode and I guess

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.259 
that's the entire episode and I guess
this<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.310> not<00:04:17.340> gonna<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.639> as<00:04:17.820> much<00:04:18.000> fighting

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
this is not gonna be as much fighting

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.219 
this is not gonna be as much fighting

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
because the soldiers obviously don't

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.689 
because the soldiers obviously don't
want<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.470> fight<00:04:19.769> black<00:04:19.979> lady<00:04:20.220> because<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.609> they

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
want to fight black lady because if they

just kind of like well that means

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.830 
just kind of like well that means
there's<00:04:23.849> gonna<00:04:23.969> be<00:04:24.180> no<00:04:24.300> fighting<00:04:24.539> for<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
there's gonna be no fighting for the
