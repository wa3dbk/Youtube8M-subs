pads<00:02:38.239> bait<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.810> where<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.260> brake<00:02:39.590> die<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
pads bait is where you get brake die of

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
pads bait is where you get brake die of
once<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.230> pads<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:42.620> got<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> bait<00:02:43.190> then

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
once you the pads have got the bait then

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.610 
once you the pads have got the bait then
the<00:02:43.550> fork<00:02:43.820> will<00:02:44.000> set<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.600> work<00:02:45.230> through<00:02:45.470> its

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the fork will set and work through its

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.949 
the fork will set and work through its
travel<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:46.700> when<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.910> initially<00:02:47.239> apply<00:02:47.750> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
travel but when you initially apply and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.900 
travel but when you initially apply and
get<00:02:48.080> initial<00:02:48.470> bait<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.950> front<00:02:49.220> end<00:02:49.370> will<00:02:49.580> grip

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
get initial bait the front end will grip

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.229 
get initial bait the front end will grip
and<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.570> whether<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.050> drops<00:02:52.000> now<00:02:53.000> if<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
and it's whether it drops now if it

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.670 
and it's whether it drops now if it
drops<00:02:54.250> quickly<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:56.239> sets<00:02:56.690> that's<00:02:57.440> not

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
drops quickly and then sets that's not

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.640 
drops quickly and then sets that's not
good<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.450> if<00:03:00.320> you're

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
good because you get that if you're

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.490 
good because you get that if you're
getting<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.820> nice<00:03:02.239> smooth<00:03:02.780> linear<00:03:03.080> drop

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
getting that a nice smooth linear drop

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.470 
getting that a nice smooth linear drop
that's<00:03:04.190> perfect<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.330> can

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
that's perfect because then you can

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.660 
that's perfect because then you can
modulate<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.080> lever<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.010> trust<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
modulate the lever you can trust the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.740 
modulate the lever you can trust the
front<00:03:07.910> end<00:03:08.060> because<00:03:08.180> you're<00:03:08.510> controlling

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
front end because you're controlling

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.490 
front end because you're controlling
everything<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.650> does<00:03:09.799> make<00:03:10.700> sense<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.500> we've

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
everything it does make sense and we've

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.690 
everything it does make sense and we've
got<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.769> work<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.220> front<00:03:13.430> end<00:03:13.519> here

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
got to work on the front end here

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.850 
got to work on the front end here
because<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.060> all<00:03:14.299> braking<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:15.019> all

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
because it's all braking here all

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.820 
because it's all braking here all
braking<00:03:16.459> yeah<00:03:17.120> all<00:03:17.420> right<00:03:17.600> go<00:03:18.230> ahead<00:03:18.440> jump<00:03:18.650> off

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
braking yeah all right go ahead jump off

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.229 
braking yeah all right go ahead jump off
I'm<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.160> make<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> small<00:03:19.730> change<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.120> the

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
I'm going to make a small change to the

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.309 
I'm going to make a small change to the
front<00:03:20.570> okay

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.270 

how<00:03:24.860> do<00:03:24.920> you<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.189> the<00:03:25.340> track<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:27.260> turn<00:03:28.040> one

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
how do you like the track it's turn one

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.349 
how do you like the track it's turn one
still<00:03:28.609> freaks<00:03:28.909> me<00:03:28.969> out

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
still freaks me out

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.720 
still freaks me out
I<00:03:29.390> blew<00:03:29.689> it<00:03:29.719> by<00:03:30.140> first<00:03:30.409> three<00:03:30.590> times<00:03:30.799> just<00:03:31.549> read

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
I blew it by first three times just read

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.130 
I blew it by first three times just read
through<00:03:31.879> couldn't<00:03:32.390> even<00:03:32.540> game<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:32.989> try

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
through couldn't even game and try

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.080 
through couldn't even game and try
making<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.920> another<00:03:34.129> checkered<00:03:34.549> flag<00:03:34.879> I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
making it then another checkered flag I

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.179 
making it then another checkered flag I
forced<00:03:35.480> myself<00:03:35.599> to<00:03:35.900> take<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:36.950> doesn't

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
forced myself to take it and it doesn't

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.910 
forced myself to take it and it doesn't
seem<00:03:37.340> as<00:03:37.459> bad<00:03:37.640> seems<00:03:38.569> worse<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.349> know<00:03:39.469> right

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
seem as bad seems worse you know right

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.880 
seem as bad seems worse you know right
I'm<00:03:40.189> so<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:41.450> yeah<00:03:42.079> I<00:03:42.260> just<00:03:42.379> need<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.709> tip

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
I'm so it just yeah I just need to tip

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.160 
I'm so it just yeah I just need to tip
it<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.189> go<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.609> it<00:03:43.819> opens<00:03:44.150> up<00:03:44.299> what's<00:03:45.079> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
it and it go and it opens up what's the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.920 
it and it go and it opens up what's the
initial<00:03:45.439> turn<00:03:45.829> exactly<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> go<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:47.750> I'm

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
initial turn exactly I go but all I'm

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
initial turn exactly I go but all I'm
seeing<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.349> just<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.769> square<00:03:49.099> on<00:03:49.250> basically

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
seeing is just the square on basically

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.869 
seeing is just the square on basically
and<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.959> goes<00:03:51.189> nothing<00:03:52.189> like<00:03:52.340> turn<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.849> a

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
and that goes nothing like turn to a

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.509 
and that goes nothing like turn to a
Seattle<00:03:53.540> where<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.079> can<00:03:54.290> see<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:55.099> can<00:03:55.129> see

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
Seattle where you can see it you can see

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.429 
Seattle where you can see it you can see
it<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:55.879> all<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.180> sudden<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.540> come<00:03:56.780> down<00:03:57.230> the

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
it but all of a sudden you come down the

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.160 
it but all of a sudden you come down the
hill<00:03:57.709> phew<00:03:58.430> worth<00:03:58.579> that<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.659> problem<00:04:00.049> is

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
hill phew worth that and the problem is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.569 
hill phew worth that and the problem is
you're<00:04:00.349> getting<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.709> G<00:04:00.980> load<00:04:01.189> because<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
you're getting a G load because you

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.360 
you're getting a G load because you
coming<00:04:01.939> down<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.689> breaking<00:04:03.109> so<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:03.769> double

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
coming down and breaking so you double

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.159 
coming down and breaking so you double
the<00:04:04.489> force<00:04:04.760> on<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> front<00:04:05.419> when<00:04:06.049> you're

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
the force on the front when you're

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.869 
the force on the front when you're
trying<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.439> break<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.919> turn<00:04:07.099> it<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.459> it's<00:04:07.639> not

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
trying to break and turn it and it's not

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.720 
trying to break and turn it and it's not
unless<00:04:08.359> it's<00:04:08.599> perfectly<00:04:09.079> stable<00:04:09.409> you<00:04:10.400> just<00:04:10.609> go

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
unless it's perfectly stable you just go

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.649 
unless it's perfectly stable you just go
oh<00:04:11.409> no<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.819> we've<00:04:13.970> got<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.209> get<00:04:14.329> you<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
oh no so we've got to get you to the

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.009 
oh no so we've got to get you to the
point<00:04:14.900> where<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.200> can<00:04:15.409> come<00:04:15.650> off<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.639> ramp

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
point where you can come off that ramp

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.469 
point where you can come off that ramp
break<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.380> have<00:04:19.009> full<00:04:19.579> modulation<00:04:20.120> on<00:04:20.389> the

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
break and have full modulation on the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.350 
break and have full modulation on the
lever<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.930> then<00:04:21.109> just<00:04:22.009> be<00:04:22.160> I've<00:04:22.759> got<00:04:23.030> it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
lever and then just be I've got it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.330 
lever and then just be I've got it
that's<00:04:24.320> my<00:04:24.530> turning<00:04:24.919> point<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.430> away<00:04:25.759> you<00:04:25.789> go

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:55.420 

yeah<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.450> got<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.750> now

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.010 

that's<00:04:55.790> better

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.810 

now<00:04:58.970> when<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.120> cold<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:02.220> seem<00:05:02.460> dumb<00:05:02.640> and

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
now when it's cold you seem dumb and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.940 
now when it's cold you seem dumb and
Dumberer<00:05:03.080> where<00:05:04.080> he<00:05:04.140> sticks<00:05:04.410> his<00:05:04.470> tongue<00:05:04.590> on

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
Dumberer where he sticks his tongue on

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.390 
Dumberer where he sticks his tongue on
the<00:05:05.070> ski<00:05:05.580> lift<00:05:06.290> you've<00:05:07.290> got<00:05:07.500> ice<00:05:07.740> cold<00:05:08.130> metal

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
the ski lift you've got ice cold metal

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.010 
the ski lift you've got ice cold metal
in<00:05:09.180> cold<00:05:09.720> air<00:05:09.960> doing<00:05:10.380> 100-plus<00:05:11.070> miles<00:05:11.400> an<00:05:11.610> hour

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
in cold air doing 100-plus miles an hour

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.240 
in cold air doing 100-plus miles an hour
so<00:05:13.020> in<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.230> mornings<00:05:13.650> you've<00:05:13.830> got<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.040> open

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
so in the mornings you've got to open

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.490 
so in the mornings you've got to open
the<00:05:14.490> hydraulic<00:05:14.940> damping<00:05:15.360> up<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.020> oil<00:05:16.230> can

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
the hydraulic damping up so the oil can

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.770 
the hydraulic damping up so the oil can
flow<00:05:16.580> otherwise<00:05:17.580> they<00:05:17.880> all<00:05:18.060> stays<00:05:18.360> really

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
flow otherwise they all stays really

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.050 
flow otherwise they all stays really
cold<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.290> your<00:05:20.010> front<00:05:20.280> end<00:05:20.430> will<00:05:20.550> feel<00:05:20.730> really

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
cold and your front end will feel really

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.380 
cold and your front end will feel really
vague<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.920> start<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:23.490> until<00:05:23.880> we<00:05:24.030> really

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
vague so to start with until we really

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.060 
vague so to start with until we really
get<00:05:24.510> warm<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.470> get<00:05:25.650> more<00:05:25.830> comfortable

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
get warm and you get more comfortable

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.130 
get warm and you get more comfortable
with<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.580> forks<00:05:26.940> I'm<00:05:27.570> going<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.810> open<00:05:28.020> your

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
with the forks I'm going to open your

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.250 
with the forks I'm going to open your
rebound<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.710> rebound<00:05:29.520> only<00:05:30.030> up<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.780> it's

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
rebound and rebound only up so that it's

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.900 
rebound and rebound only up so that it's
always<00:05:31.740> pushing<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.250> tire<00:05:32.460> back<00:05:32.670> to<00:05:32.820> the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
always pushing the tire back to the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.950 
always pushing the tire back to the
ground<00:05:33.150> which<00:05:33.360> will<00:05:33.480> give<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.750> much<00:05:33.930> more

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
ground which will give you a much more

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.550 
ground which will give you a much more
secure<00:05:34.560> feeling<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:36.690> faster<00:05:37.140> you<00:05:37.230> go<00:05:37.380> in

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
secure feeling the faster you go in

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.140 
secure feeling the faster you go in
colder<00:05:37.890> weather<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.340> worse<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.790> front-end

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
colder weather the worse the front-end

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.660 
colder weather the worse the front-end
works<00:05:39.560> because<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.680> just<00:05:40.830> keeps<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.340> metal

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
works because it just keeps the metal

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.160 
works because it just keeps the metal
high<00:05:41.880> school<00:05:42.800> so<00:05:43.800> as<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:45.300> day<00:05:45.450> goes<00:05:45.660> on<00:05:45.840> if<00:05:46.050> you

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
high school so as the day goes on if you

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.870 
high school so as the day goes on if you
feel<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.590> front<00:05:46.830> end<00:05:47.010> especially<00:05:47.430> going

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
feel the front end especially going

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.000 
feel the front end especially going
through<00:05:47.970> these<00:05:48.300> long<00:05:48.510> corners<00:05:48.990> when<00:05:49.860> you're

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
through these long corners when you're

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.520 
through these long corners when you're
at<00:05:50.130> steady<00:05:50.460> throttle<00:05:50.790> looking<00:05:51.240> ahead<00:05:51.360> if<00:05:51.780> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
at steady throttle looking ahead if the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.640 
at steady throttle looking ahead if the
bar<00:05:52.710> starts<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.370> do<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.790> side<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.480> side<00:05:54.720> then

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
bar starts to do that side to side then

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.110 
bar starts to do that side to side then
I've<00:05:55.800> got<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.070> start<00:05:56.280> turning<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.760> rebound

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
I've got to start turning the rebound

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.390 
I've got to start turning the rebound
back<00:05:57.360> in<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:58.740> won't<00:05:58.920> happen<00:05:59.070> till<00:05:59.280> about

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
back in but that won't happen till about

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.420 
back in but that won't happen till about
one<00:05:59.700> o'clock<00:05:59.970> here<00:06:00.710> so<00:06:01.710> it's<00:06:01.860> much<00:06:02.040> better<00:06:02.190> to

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
one o'clock here so it's much better to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.010 
one o'clock here so it's much better to
feel<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:02.910> front<00:06:03.120> end<00:06:03.270> working<00:06:03.480> underneath

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
feel the front end working underneath

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.800 
feel the front end working underneath
you<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.740> then<00:06:04.890> going<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.070> be<00:06:05.190> going<00:06:05.810> what's

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
you and then going to be going what's

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:14.990 
you and then going to be going what's
going<00:06:07.260> on

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.140 

step

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.450 

okay<00:06:19.780> let's<00:06:20.020> see<00:06:20.320> where<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:20.650> are<00:06:21.100> Dave's

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
okay let's see where you are Dave's

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:30.990 
okay let's see where you are Dave's
needles

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.629 

semmen<00:06:31.690> a<00:06:31.780> made<00:06:32.350> out

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.240 

so<00:06:35.240> you<00:06:35.300> you<00:06:35.960> were<00:06:36.139> at<00:06:36.319> eight<00:06:36.469> klicks<00:06:36.740> out<00:06:36.979> I'm

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
so you you were at eight klicks out I'm

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.369 
so you you were at eight klicks out I'm
going<00:06:37.400> to<00:06:37.490> put<00:06:37.639> you<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:37.819> six<00:06:38.210> because<00:06:39.199> there's

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
going to put you to six because there's

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.600 
going to put you to six because there's
so<00:06:39.560> much<00:06:39.710> breaking<00:06:42.039> I'm<00:06:43.039> one<00:06:43.250> of<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.430> key

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
so much breaking I'm one of the key

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.129 
so much breaking I'm one of the key
concepts<00:06:44.150> here<00:06:44.330> which<00:06:44.479> we'll<00:06:44.659> get<00:06:44.780> into<00:06:44.840> later

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
concepts here which we'll get into later

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.839 
concepts here which we'll get into later
this<00:06:45.500> morning<00:06:45.740> is<00:06:46.099> its<00:06:46.250> brake<00:06:46.639> gas<00:06:47.830> turn<00:06:48.849> not

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
this morning is its brake gas turn not

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.309 
this morning is its brake gas turn not
brake<00:06:50.180> turn<00:06:50.750> then<00:06:51.740> gas<00:06:52.509> it's<00:06:53.509> a<00:06:53.659> huge<00:06:53.990> paradigm

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
brake turn then gas it's a huge paradigm

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.459 
brake turn then gas it's a huge paradigm
shift<00:06:54.919> because<00:06:55.280> you<00:06:56.030> unless<00:06:56.810> you're<00:06:57.139> trail

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:57.469 
shift because you unless you're trail

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:59.679 
shift because you unless you're trail
braking<00:06:58.009> as<00:06:58.219> far<00:06:58.729> into<00:06:58.909> the<00:06:59.060> corner<00:06:59.449> as<00:06:59.539> you

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
braking as far into the corner as you

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.779 
braking as far into the corner as you
can<00:06:59.900> if<00:07:00.620> you're<00:07:00.830> doing<00:07:00.979> that<00:07:01.129> then<00:07:01.400> it's<00:07:01.550> going

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789 
can if you're doing that then it's going

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.709 
can if you're doing that then it's going
to<00:07:01.849> be<00:07:01.969> brake<00:07:02.360> and<00:07:02.949> turn<00:07:03.949> then<00:07:04.669> gas<00:07:04.939> not<00:07:05.389> brake

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
to be brake and turn then gas not brake

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.980 
to be brake and turn then gas not brake
turn<00:07:06.469> gas<00:07:07.129> so<00:07:08.120> I've<00:07:08.270> got<00:07:08.419> to<00:07:08.509> figure<00:07:08.659> out

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
turn gas so I've got to figure out

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.110 
turn gas so I've got to figure out
figure<00:07:09.830> out<00:07:10.009> what<00:07:10.370> you're<00:07:10.520> doing<00:07:10.849> on<00:07:10.969> the

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
figure out what you're doing on the

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.390 
figure out what you're doing on the
track<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:12.139> we've<00:07:12.319> got<00:07:12.469> you<00:07:12.919> know<00:07:13.009> plenty<00:07:13.279> of

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
track and we've got you know plenty of

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.909 
track and we've got you know plenty of
practice<00:07:13.819> time<00:07:14.060> so<00:07:14.810> session<00:07:15.080> by<00:07:15.379> session<00:07:15.439> I'll

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
practice time so session by session I'll
