and<00:00:23.160> maybe<00:00:23.519> tomorrow<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.029> don't<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.269> when

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and maybe tomorrow I don't know when

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.109 
and maybe tomorrow I don't know when
your<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:25.019> game<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.519> we're<00:00:26.519> playing<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:26.970> soon

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
your first game is we're playing as soon

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.080 
your first game is we're playing as soon
as<00:00:27.269> possible<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:27.779> first<00:00:28.050> group<00:00:28.439> stage<00:00:28.710> game

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
as possible our first group stage game

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.490 
as possible our first group stage game
it's<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> difficult<00:00:30.449> mostly<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it's kind of difficult mostly because it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
it's kind of difficult mostly because it
were<00:00:31.619> only<00:00:31.800> three<00:00:32.099> teams<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> group<00:00:32.730> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
were only three teams in a group so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720 
were only three teams in a group so
makes<00:00:33.840> no<00:00:33.989> sense<00:00:34.260> having<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.800> dsl<00:00:35.219> system<00:00:35.579> for

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
makes no sense having the dsl system for

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.450 
makes no sense having the dsl system for
us<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:37.170> i<00:00:37.200> guess<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.530> gotta<00:00:37.739> walk<00:00:38.040> over<00:00:38.430> i

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
us but i guess we gotta walk over i

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
us but i guess we gotta walk over i
guess<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.300> round<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.840> if<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.559> win

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
guess in the first round so if we win

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.340 
guess in the first round so if we win
every<00:00:40.950> game<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> group<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
every game we're first in a group and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.209 
every game we're first in a group and
what<00:00:43.350> i<00:00:43.379> understand<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.190> sure

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
what i understand but I'm not sure

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.560 
what i understand but I'm not sure
though<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.219> sure<00:00:47.250> about<00:00:47.640> those<00:00:47.969> 200

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570

forum<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> grounding<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> group<00:00:49.440> we're

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
forum is grounding the group we're

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.200 
forum is grounding the group we're
playing<00:00:49.980> against<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.340> local<00:00:50.789> teams<00:00:51.000> here

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
playing against two local teams here

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.979 
playing against two local teams here
from<00:00:51.420> Denmark<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:53.449> think<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.780> go

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
from Denmark and I think it's gonna go

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
from Denmark and I think it's gonna go
smooth<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.730> hope<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.660> any

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
smooth I don't hope that we got them any

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
smooth I don't hope that we got them any
troubles<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> beginning<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.300> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
troubles in the beginning because it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
troubles in the beginning because it's
the<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:00.780> game<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> tournament<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.980> we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the first game of the tournament if we

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.789 
the first game of the tournament if we
just<00:01:02.340> relax<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> play<00:01:03.210> our<00:01:03.390> own<00:01:03.420> game<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.049> we

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
just relax and play our own game and we

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
just relax and play our own game and we
don't<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.129> any<00:01:05.339> stupid<00:01:05.640> mistakes<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.930> we're

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
don't do any stupid mistakes and we're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.240 
don't do any stupid mistakes and we're
going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.439> too<00:01:07.560> worried<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> playoffs

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
going to get too worried to the playoffs

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
going to get too worried to the playoffs
and<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.390> perfect<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> good

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and I think it's perfect and a good

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
and I think it's perfect and a good
opportunity<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.280> us<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> play<00:01:11.729> safe<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> take

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
thinking that we're gonna we're gonna be

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.580 
thinking that we're gonna we're gonna be
splitting<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.420> two<00:01:47.450> different<00:01:48.260> like

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
splitting in two different like

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.620
