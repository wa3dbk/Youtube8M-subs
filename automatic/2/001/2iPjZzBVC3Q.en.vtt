00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.580
 another game tactically very 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.280
 interesting and in which the madrid has 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.710
 come out with a creative approach 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.570
 offensive a slightly different drawing 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.460
 modding and mariah interior that is not in 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.220
 4-2-3-1 as he was playing on the team 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.000
 but that madrid has not played in parallel 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.170
 Alonso but not having to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.269
 sacrifice to isco and by not having a 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.110
 player like khedira for example has 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.650
 Di Maria got in the height of luka 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.019
 modric 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.780
 to have a lot of the ball has had 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.440
 Made Real Madrid and Espanyol had 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.220
 very clear that his idea was to join 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.890
 many players of let's say for 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.659
 protect yourself inside and has called the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.540
 attention the position the location there what 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.670
 we are seeing and álex fernández the ex 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.920
 player of the branch of the Real Madrid 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.629
 which he has played an attacking midfielder or almost 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.580
 second front has indeed been of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.409
 the three-quarter players the one 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.390
 less defensive responsibility has 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.770
 had we are going to see this replica recap 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 sánchez raúl rodríguez 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.550
 obviously double midfielder are in the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.460
 left 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.290
 the right and those that replicate are the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 band players and it's already acting and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.910
 a long time ago and there you will get 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.700
 also gabriel torje to retreat and the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.400
 that remains as the last center of the track 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.680
 at the time of refolding is to say the most 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.100
 free here ends up coming is álex 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.230
 fernandez that is álex almost almost in a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.990
 4-4-1-1 behind the main point 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.480
 that has been john córdoba evidently 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.090
 a key choice in this scheme so 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.730
 of counter-attack raúl rodríguez a central 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.770
 put it permanently in that area to 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.380
 watch second plays is by 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 in front of colotto and also in front 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.940
 by héctor moreno 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.390
 the idea was an idea that was very valid 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 while the match is 0-0 or if 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 I managed to put Espanyol ahead of me 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.160
 in Cordoba is a bullet and they have not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.660
 could stop the truth is that Cordoba has 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.540
 he was proud that when he challenged him and 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.700
 before bouquets 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.280
 Come look him in the eyes 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.129
 and it makes the movement well bouquets of 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 enter at the right time but it's 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.860
 strongest cordoba that is to say he's talking 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.019
 ramos before a cordoba a cordoba 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.690
 irrepressible in speed to space 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.540
 pure power there have been moments in the 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.910
 that seemed impossible for the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.130
 footballers of real madrid for this 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.620
 player this has been his best action 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.569
 surely it happens between three is that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.250
 it can is that it seems to play is rubber 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.769
 that bounced off the Real Madrid 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.290
 when they play against the cordoba of all 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.290
 modes has lacked that ending not 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.799
 there he gets almost drunk with the ball and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.410
 the boss sends the jhon cordoba tier 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.640
 the tip that I had in this match 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.970
 javier aguirre 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.330
 the idea that it will take advantage of 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.790
 backlash what happens what 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.480
 good in the second part because there have been 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.670
 changes after after the goal there 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.340
 are the changes that I was ordering 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.020
 javier aguirre with his assistant and when 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.390
 the madrid has already marked the espanyol has 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.710
 had to modify that idea a bit 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.090
 as he has done putting two 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.180
 players of the imbalance in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.640
 bands simao spear and stuani second 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.280
 of the second tip is to say a player with 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.740
 more goal to support Córdoba and the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.330
 players from the sides we would say no 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.640
 players so direct but players 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.320
 with solutions to dribble to search 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.120
 one against one that was what the team 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.400
 I needed the option once 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.980
 kickback was no longer so clear because 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 Madrid was already winning and did not leave 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.820
 so many spaces
