 [Music] 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello we will make another necklace with trapillo 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.120
 this time with a more cheerful color I do not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 I'm going to finish it, I just want to show 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.100
 how to make the press is worth it for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.080
 finish just have to adapt a 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.750
 quite wide terminal some rings and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.439
 a carabiner that we will need then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.570
 trapillo a meter or a meter or 15 more or 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 less and as you know there are more trapillo 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 wide or thinner 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.749
 I have chosen delfino is worth so that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 do not call me so much a meter 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.610
 of link chain wide the link 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.180
 about one centimeter and well the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.130
 terminals and the carabiner we started 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 we take and cut two strips of trapillo 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.710
 one meter each and we make it a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.870
 node between them 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.390
 try not to twist that always 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 there is a right and a setback for 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.149
 trapillo 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.149
 [Music] 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.459
 [Music] 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.189
 and we squeeze 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.189
 [Music] 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.610
 with robes I mean the double of 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.610
 trapillo from behind 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 and this is the right good as we take 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.750
 the chain and what we are going to do is 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.580
 happen 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.280
 this pulls below the link first 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.180
 of the chain 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.180
 I have it 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.880
 and he passed it over the link if 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 basically a braid will be made the only 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.220
 that what we will not move is the chain and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.890
 what will be interlaced will be the trapillo 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.400
 we will always move only trapillo 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.620
 then I have above the link 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.550
 is this strip that we have left to the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.720
 the left will go over 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.760
 the other and for being the first link 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.020
 to make the start I'm going to put 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.700
 also in the same 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.400
 in the same lake I want to say 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.430
 and shooting is to adapt the chain well 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.459
 [Music] 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.930
 here I have it now we are going to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.810
 start the braid 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.470
 went over the east chain 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 right then the left one above 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.600
 of this strip always keeping the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.840
 right of the cloth and look for the next 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.160
 link below and when looking for the way 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.160
 trapillo down 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.070
 according to below 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.349
 [Music] 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.440
 once 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.470
 below and what I do happened to him over 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.030
 because the left strip is going to come 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.030
 above the center 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:11.030
 above the center I'm going down 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.030
 the chain and go through the link 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.170
 you are watching the braid 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.550
 above work 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.550
 looking for the right 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.860
 left strip on the middle one 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.709
 I search in the voice and go and went down 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.709
 [Music] 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.680
 good until we'll continue until 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.189
 down 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.189
 [Music] 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.150
 we are seeing that we are placing the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.170
 reverse is always here 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 and the right 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.569
 and I put and stretched either I squeezed it jce 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.440
 a lot because otherwise the chain shrinks and 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.600
 I would not have mobility and I'm going to leave it 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.460
 because I kind of want it about 45 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.590
 centimeters long which is more or less 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.840
 the height that I like and it's already 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.149
 we have it but that you liked it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.619
 see you later 

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.619
