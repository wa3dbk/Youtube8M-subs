00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.200
 hi i am ai love touch 10 to whom not me 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.299
 I bring you a very good video and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.129
 about a tweet is to use the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.559
 gestures multi tasks on the iphone or the 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.050
 ipod touch and multi-tasking gestures 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.150
 you want to upload a video a few months ago and 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.070
 interact 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 about going in the tools of 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.419
 multitasking specifically with 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.099
 our fingers without using the buttons 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.009
 simply using the touch screen 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.220
 and there are several methods to activate them 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.720
 but and a user recommended me a method 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 which is much simpler than the others 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.850
 and this user is called said 2009 and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.110
 they are simply activated as a theme like that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.350
 how good are we going to see how they work 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.740
 first for example with four fingers 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.660
 up is saying like that and then take out 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.130
 the multitasking bar that used to be 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 double is still good 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.970
 can do with double tap and good here 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.030
 There is the bar 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.470
 here are all the birds that I have 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.060
 open and for example here my goal 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.000
 music 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.490
 in short I may not be reproducing the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.960
 song and continue with other apps as 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.510
 does not normally play it 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.370
 now but with just four fingers 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.920
 to the left I could be with 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.330
 other apps is to say so I do it for the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.000
 camera in this way because I do not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.250
 accommodation and here I am in settings here 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.070
 I'm in the appstore and here I am in 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.540
 cinepolis and I'm already in forgiveness is 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.450
 isolated for the other time it seems that it was 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.940
 iTunes and here I'm inclined and that's how it is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.340
 how it works and then I do not know why 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.260
 example let's reopen music and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 when you want to close it like this 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.619
 you need to get out by pressing the button 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.810
 home but it may be interacting 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.900
 and just with five fingers you make a 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.270
 I spike it would be like they're towards 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.700
 the two outside fingers and collect in 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.950
 the center and with five fingers and these are 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.479
 the multitasking gestures so let's go 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 to see how to get it simply inter 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.860
 our device with jailbreak a 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.860
 Once you have it, we go to cydia 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.830
 simple we are simply going to do 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.780
 tsc and we look for the inti or mt 10 tours 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.610
 team that is here the only one that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 appears on dj tours team 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.680
 and simply another we trust the peta insta 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.690
 and they trust they will ask even 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 west wing and then need winterboard 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.880
 just like they look for gums and they do not have it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 and I 'm going to teach you how to simply 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.740
 they look for winterboard and everyone should 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 have to activate themes 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.220
 in short simply here they put 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.010
 winterboard equal install and confirm if 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.290
 they do not have it and in winter world cancer s 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 lighting and logically work 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.650
 only for devices with ios 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.860
 4.3.1 I suppose it works with versions 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.170
 later for example the 4.3.2 me 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.360
 it seems like it works well and good 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.160
 here they will give us four themes and for ipod 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.739
 fourth generation touch for third 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.560
 generation for the taxpayer and for 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.170
 iphone 4 so I eat an adeco 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
 top 4 active this and you activate the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 that they have logically and if they are going to have 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.550
 these gestures so this was video 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.890
 pitching recommendation 2009 that's 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.720
