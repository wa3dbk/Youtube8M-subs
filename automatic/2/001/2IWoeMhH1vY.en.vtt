00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 It is a compilation sheet of the 5th 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.880
 Can be stored in a palm-sized compact 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.129
 I will take it anywhere 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 Well what is this 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.800

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.310
 later 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.670
 When you enter to a certain extent 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 We put in the air 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.260
 A cushion is completed 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 Die for mastering 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.840
 Because it is acrobat storage 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.590
 Wherever you are 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 Can bring 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 I think it is good for a car or bus trip 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.900

 Size baht 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.560
 31.5 cm 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.770
 The 41.5 cm thickness is 3.2 cm 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.610
 Inside size is 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.520
 The diameter is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.760
 9 cm 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 It is 30 cm in length 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 Then you can pattern 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.610
 Parco is doing it 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 Kiss 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.330

 We have teamed up with the team 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.020
 Also when going out 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.010
 Tomoki Kanagi 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.370
