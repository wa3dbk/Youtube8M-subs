00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
thing and I'm going to quickly zoom into

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.180 
thing and I'm going to quickly zoom into
the<00:01:04.269> bottom<00:01:04.690> right<00:01:04.900> corner<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.470> in<00:01:06.040> this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
the bottom right corner and in this

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.499 
the bottom right corner and in this
corner<00:01:06.400> I'm<00:01:06.729> not<00:01:06.880> too<00:01:07.000> sure<00:01:07.150> if<00:01:07.180> you<00:01:07.360> can<00:01:07.450> see

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
corner I'm not too sure if you can see

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.719 
corner I'm not too sure if you can see
but<00:01:07.990> there<00:01:08.170> are<00:01:08.320> two<00:01:08.590> combat<00:01:09.040> axes<00:01:09.400> now<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
but there are two combat axes now the

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.420 
but there are two combat axes now the
combat<00:01:10.690> axe<00:01:10.899> I'm<00:01:11.800> pretty<00:01:11.979> sure<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.250> works

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
combat axe I'm pretty sure it works

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.430 
combat axe I'm pretty sure it works
really<00:01:12.670> similar<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.360> tomahawk<00:01:13.899> I<00:01:14.140> think

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
really similar to the tomahawk I think

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.170 
really similar to the tomahawk I think
they<00:01:14.530> just<00:01:14.560> renamed<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.310> because<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
they just renamed it because the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.900 
they just renamed it because the
tomahawk<00:01:16.600> sounded<00:01:16.960> really<00:01:17.110> old<00:01:17.410> and<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.670> out

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
tomahawk sounded really old and just out

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.760 
tomahawk sounded really old and just out
of<00:01:19.030> date<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.750> combat<00:01:20.080> axe<00:01:20.229> just<00:01:20.470> sounds<00:01:20.740> a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
of date and the combat axe just sounds a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.639 
of date and the combat axe just sounds a
lot<00:01:20.890> more<00:01:20.950> modern<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.700> futuristic<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:23.080> this

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
lot more modern and futuristic so this

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.080 
lot more modern and futuristic so this
shows<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.160> can<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.430> at<00:01:24.610> least<00:01:24.789> two

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
shows that you can have at least two

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.760 
shows that you can have at least two
common<00:01:25.479> taxes<00:01:25.810> I'm<00:01:26.020> not<00:01:26.200> too<00:01:26.320> sure<00:01:26.470> if<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.649> can

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
common taxes I'm not too sure if you can

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.460 
common taxes I'm not too sure if you can
have<00:01:26.920> more<00:01:27.220> but<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:27.970> think<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.110> have<00:01:29.259> at

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
have more but I think you can have at

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.980 
have more but I think you can have at
least<00:01:29.680> two<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.310> that's<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.330> a<00:01:31.660> good<00:01:31.840> not

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
least two so that's just a good not

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.950 
least two so that's just a good not
another<00:01:32.289> good<00:01:32.560> thing<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.740> know<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.720> back<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
another good thing to know so back to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080 
another good thing to know so back to
the<00:01:35.229> regular<00:01:35.440> picture<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.190> I'm<00:01:36.550> gonna<00:01:36.729> go<00:01:36.910> let

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the regular picture and I'm gonna go let

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.920 
the regular picture and I'm gonna go let
the<00:01:37.180> video<00:01:37.450> play

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
the video play

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.590 
the video play
so<00:01:39.740> right<00:01:39.950> there<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.310> threw<00:01:40.520> his<00:01:40.730> first<00:01:41.060> combat

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
so right there he threw his first combat

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.170 
so right there he threw his first combat

or a mer of the comma X looks just about

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.760 
or a mer of the comma X looks just about
exactly<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.360> same<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.930> one<00:01:48.260> in<00:01:48.290> black<00:01:48.560> ops

feel<00:01:53.060> exactly<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.600> same<00:01:53.690> it's<00:01:54.200> gonna<00:01:54.380> kind<00:01:55.040> of

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
feel exactly the same it's gonna kind of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.100 
feel exactly the same it's gonna kind of
fly<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.970> motion<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.600> speed<00:01:56.840> will<00:01:56.990> be

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
fly and the motion and the speed will be

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.620 
fly and the motion and the speed will be
just<00:01:57.380> about<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.620> same<00:01:57.860> but<00:01:58.850> then<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.300> the

to take less explosive damage ghost so I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.199

these are the perks for tier 2 there is

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.750 
these are the perks for tier 2 there is

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
toughness and fast hands these are all

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.289 
toughness and fast hands these are all
or<00:03:21.799> some<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> them<00:03:22.459> are<00:03:22.610> pretty<00:03:22.790> new<00:03:23.030> perks

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
or some of them are pretty new perks

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.420 
or some of them are pretty new perks
they<00:03:24.140> haven't<00:03:24.440> been<00:03:24.530> introduced<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.280> old

college<00:03:25.730> ids<00:03:25.970> but<00:03:26.690> for<00:03:27.260> tier<00:03:27.680> 2<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.890> think<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
college ids but for tier 2 I think the

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.880 
college ids but for tier 2 I think the
perks<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.180> would<00:03:29.510> maybe<00:03:29.690> consider<00:03:30.049> for

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
perks that I would maybe consider for

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.890 
perks that I would maybe consider for
knifing<00:03:31.040> Lee<00:03:31.340> would<00:03:31.549> probably<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.239> scavenger

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
knifing Lee would probably be scavenger

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.830 
knifing Lee would probably be scavenger
for<00:03:33.640> replenishing<00:03:34.640> ammo<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.180> grenades<00:03:35.239> I'm

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
for replenishing ammo and grenades I'm

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
targeting systems I'm not too sure what

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.490 
targeting systems I'm not too sure what
targeting<00:03:46.220> systems<00:03:46.549> really<00:03:47.060> means<00:03:47.329> i'm<00:03:48.230> not

targeting systems really means i'm not

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620 
targeting systems really means i'm not
sure<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:48.889> like<00:03:49.130> IM<00:03:49.519> esas<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.209> sentry

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
sure if it's like IM esas and sentry

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.770 
sure if it's like IM esas and sentry
guns<00:03:50.810> or

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
guns or

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.860 
guns or
into<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.440> then<00:03:53.160> fast<00:03:53.520> hands<00:03:53.819> is<00:03:54.120> pretty

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
into that and then fast hands is pretty

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.199 
into that and then fast hands is pretty
cool<00:03:55.140> perk<00:03:55.380> faster<00:03:56.069> usage<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.550> equipments<00:03:57.090> I

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
cool perk faster usage of equipments I

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.000 
cool perk faster usage of equipments I
think<00:03:57.420> that's<00:03:57.540> pretty<00:03:57.690> cool<00:03:57.990> so<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.860> throw

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
think that's pretty cool so I can throw

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.670 
think that's pretty cool so I can throw
my<00:03:59.130> comment<00:03:59.490> axis<00:03:59.730> faster<00:04:00.150> but<00:04:00.810> anyways<00:04:01.319> on

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
my comment axis faster but anyways on

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.070 
my comment axis faster but anyways on
two<00:04:01.890> tier<00:04:02.220> three<00:04:02.610> all<00:04:03.420> right<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:03.720> these<00:04:03.900> are

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
two tier three all right so these are

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.570 
two tier three all right so these are
the<00:04:04.110> perks<00:04:04.350> for<00:04:04.560> tier<00:04:04.770> 3<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:05.490> are

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the perks for tier 3 and there are

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.670 
the perks for tier 3 and there are
actually<00:04:05.940> quite<00:04:06.240> a<00:04:06.510> few<00:04:06.780> perks<00:04:07.020> that<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.319> think

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
actually quite a few perks that I think

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.290 
actually quite a few perks that I think
would<00:04:07.770> be<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:07.950> useful<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.730> knifing<00:04:08.910> only

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
would be really useful for knifing only

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.320 
would be really useful for knifing only
so<00:04:09.930> let's<00:04:10.319> get<00:04:10.380> started<00:04:10.500> um<00:04:11.280> first<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.180> all<00:04:12.300> I

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
so let's get started um first of all I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.030 
so let's get started um first of all I
would<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:12.959> want<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.319> use<00:04:13.440> dead<00:04:13.650> silence

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
would really want to use dead silence

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.949 
would really want to use dead silence
that<00:04:14.280> sounds<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.060> know<00:04:15.150> move<00:04:15.360> silently<00:04:15.600> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
that sounds you know move silently that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.080 
that sounds you know move silently that
think<00:04:16.139> that's<00:04:16.290> pretty<00:04:16.560> useful<00:04:17.090> extreme

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
think that's pretty useful extreme

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.819 
think that's pretty useful extreme
conditioning<00:04:18.540> sprint<00:04:18.930> lager<00:04:19.139> that's<00:04:19.470> that's

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
conditioning sprint lager that's that's

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.069 
conditioning sprint lager that's that's
another<00:04:20.100> pretty<00:04:20.609> useful<00:04:21.060> perk<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.750> both<00:04:22.049> of

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
another pretty useful perk and both of

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.140 
another pretty useful perk and both of
these<00:04:22.320> perks<00:04:22.590> were<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.160> past<00:04:23.400> colleges<00:04:23.910> but

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
these perks were in past colleges but

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.420 
these perks were in past colleges but
the<00:04:24.300> new<00:04:24.450> one<00:04:24.660> with<00:04:24.840> dexterity<00:04:25.470> which<00:04:26.220> is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the new one with dexterity which is

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.580 
the new one with dexterity which is
climb<00:04:26.730> faster<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.419> recover<00:04:27.780> from<00:04:27.990> knife<00:04:28.230> now

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
climb faster and recover from knife now

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.530 
climb faster and recover from knife now
the<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.850> really<00:04:30.000> caught<00:04:30.300> my<00:04:30.330> eye<00:04:30.480> is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the one that really caught my eye is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.810 
the one that really caught my eye is
probably<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.290> because<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:32.100> says<00:04:32.340> recover

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
probably this because it says recover

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.510 
probably this because it says recover
from<00:04:33.030> knife<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:34.919> too<00:04:35.070> sure<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.250> would

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
from knife I'm not too sure that would

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.860 
from knife I'm not too sure that would
be<00:04:35.610> really<00:04:35.790> useful<00:04:35.880> because<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.660> know<00:04:36.750> in

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
be really useful because you know in

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.200 
be really useful because you know in
black<00:04:37.080> ops<00:04:37.290> there<00:04:37.590> was<00:04:37.770> steady<00:04:38.520> aim<00:04:38.730> pro<00:04:38.760> which

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
black ops there was steady aim pro which

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.630 
black ops there was steady aim pro which
allowed<00:04:39.480> you<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.720> recover<00:04:40.050> from<00:04:40.140> your<00:04:40.380> knife

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
allowed you to recover from your knife

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.100 
allowed you to recover from your knife
not<00:04:41.640> including<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.090> ballistic<00:04:42.450> knife<00:04:42.480> but<00:04:42.870> I

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
not including the ballistic knife but I

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.320 
not including the ballistic knife but I
did<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.860> really<00:04:44.130> didn't<00:04:44.460> see<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> different<00:04:45.090> cell

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
did I really didn't see a different cell

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.300 
did I really didn't see a different cell
not<00:04:45.510> sure<00:04:45.720> if<00:04:45.960> there<00:04:46.560> will<00:04:46.650> be<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.800> difference

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
not sure if there will be a difference

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.430 
not sure if there will be a difference
at<00:04:47.580> all<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:47.910> black<00:04:48.090> ops<00:04:48.270> 2<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.110> know<00:04:49.200> I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
at all in black ops 2 but you know I
