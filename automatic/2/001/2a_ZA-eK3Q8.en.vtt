00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.660
 the heart is the symbol of life 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.890
 but what would be his if they were not the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.040
 brain the lungs the kidneys and others 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.040
 organs and the blood itself that 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.250
 oxygen and nutrients for all 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.250
 cells 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 the parts that move the human body 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.390
 They depend on each other work 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.079
 organized in an organized manner to 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.600
 life to many other systems. 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 work just like ours. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 organization of food security and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 nutritional safety is an example of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.489
 food and nutrition is a right of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.369
 every human being 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.450
 but the achievement of this right depends 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.940
 working together of important factors 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 as well as the organs of the human body 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.280
 the factors that make up the security 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.270
 food and nutrition depend on one of the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.479
 others 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.409
 each of them must comply with the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 your role as best as possible 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 to properly feed a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.440
 individual must have access to food 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.500
 Of Quality 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.560
 this means that in some way the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.060
 foods he needs 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.240
 get to your table 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.430
 but for this to happen it is necessary that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.259
 a number of other things 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 the poet sonnen the conditions of the climate and 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 the characteristics of land and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.200
 seeds should ensure good 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 guarantee a means of transport 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.659
 which takes food from the bank to the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.899
 trade is also indispensable 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.350
 and not only that, the family must have 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.989
 enough income to buy food 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.570
 the decisions taken by our 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.890
 governments also influence access to 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.040
 from each of us the food and when we 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.930
 we say each of us mean 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.970
 every individual living in Brazil 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.050
 regardless of race class or 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.900
 religion 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.610
 everyone has the right to feed themselves 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.600
 suitably with the only hope human 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 just for being born human and not eating well 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 not once but not every day 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.380
 if they do not have permanent access to 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.080
 quality feed there will be no 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.620
 food security and nutrition that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.380
 there is more for food one for your 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.690
 the function of giving substance requires the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.390
 individual knows the practices that 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.850
 ensure healthy eating 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.000
 what it takes to preserve the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.760
 vitamins proteins and carbohydrates 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.310
 vegetables fruits and vegetables which 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.790
 amount of food we should eat 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.000
 daily what a colorful mouse is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.700
 more nutritious how to prevent food 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.700
 become diseases 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.130
 all this is food security and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.470
 nutritional 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.739
 another ingredient that should not be missing 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.720
 in this very important system is that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.450
 which we consider one of the largest 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.780
 virtues of rational beings who 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 can think before acting or judging 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.150
 something or someone 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.510
 We are talking about respect Brazil is a 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.280
 an immense country and home to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.860
 various origins 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.989
 each of them has its customs and 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.510
 traditions 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.400
 including the power respect 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.459
 food preferences of the various 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.450
 peoples and regions of brazil is a duty of 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.150
 all of us when all individuals 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.340
 have access to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.470
 quality 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.600

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.600
 practices that guarantee meals 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.120
 and respect the choices 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.230
 different crops of the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.440
 our country our system still needs 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.690
 other essential factors for 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.630
 work perfectly as a job 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.860

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.010
 in leisure action and other conditions 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.780
 necessary only with all this we can 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.420
