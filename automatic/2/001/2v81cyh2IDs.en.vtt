never actually covered them because that

also before now they weren't actually

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.410 
also before now they weren't actually
confirmed<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.129> speculation<00:00:56.579> now

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
confirmed it was just speculation now

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
confirmed it was just speculation now
back<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> article<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.739> were<00:00:58.800> asked<00:00:59.219> if

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
back to the article they were asked if

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
back to the article they were asked if
identifying<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> faction<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.960> far

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
identifying with a faction now so far

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.689 
identifying with a faction now so far
before<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> game's<00:01:01.739> launch<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.460> any

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
before the game's launch would have any

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
before the game's launch would have any
consequences<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> game<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.140> replied

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
consequences in game and they replied

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
consequences in game and they replied
probably<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> best<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.299> say<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.479> now

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
probably the best thing to say right now

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
probably the best thing to say right now
is<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> factions<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.860> we've<00:01:08.100> released<00:01:08.460> they

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is the factions that we've released they

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
is the factions that we've released they
are<00:01:09.030> real<00:01:09.270> factions<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
are real factions in the game so if you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
are real factions in the game so if you
find<00:01:11.460> yourself<00:01:11.640> drawn<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> them

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
find yourself drawn to one of them

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
find yourself drawn to one of them
artistically<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> name<00:01:14.100> you'll

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
artistically or the name you'll

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
artistically or the name you'll
definitely<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.299> opportunities<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
definitely have opportunities in the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
definitely have opportunities in the
game<00:01:16.380> too<00:01:16.830> i'd<00:01:17.100> say<00:01:17.369> heightened<00:01:17.970> those

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
game too i'd say heightened those

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
game too i'd say heightened those
associations<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.740> they're<00:01:19.890> solid<00:01:20.280> proof<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
associations so they're solid proof that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
associations so they're solid proof that
the<00:01:20.759> four<00:01:20.970> factions<00:01:21.240> we've<00:01:21.600> seen<00:01:21.840> are

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the four factions we've seen are

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.899 
the four factions we've seen are
actually<00:01:22.049> real<00:01:22.680> factions<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> destiny<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
actually real factions in destiny and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
actually real factions in destiny and
they<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.090> confirmed<00:01:24.479> personally<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> think

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
they are confirmed personally I think

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
they are confirmed personally I think
PvP<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.820> handled<00:01:27.150> by<00:01:27.270> factions

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
PvP is going to be handled by factions

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.880 
PvP is going to be handled by factions
and<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> purpose<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and that's going to be the purpose of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
and that's going to be the purpose of
them<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.250> imagine<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:29.970> join<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.240> faction

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
them I imagine when you join the faction

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.090 
them I imagine when you join the faction
of<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.900> choice<00:01:31.140> it'll<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.560> enemies<00:01:31.890> with

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
of your choice it'll be enemies with

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.440 
of your choice it'll be enemies with
some<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> other<00:01:32.490> factions<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.360> then

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
some of the other factions and then

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.640 
some of the other factions and then
you'll<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> fight<00:01:34.079> members<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you'll have to fight members of that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
you'll have to fight members of that
faction<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.579> that's<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.090> opinion<00:01:36.119> we

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
faction but that's just my opinion we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
faction but that's just my opinion we
don't<00:01:36.869> actually<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> full<00:01:37.860> purpose<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
don't actually know the full purpose of

what you've experienced in game now
personally<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:03.010> think<00:03:03.159> they<00:03:03.519> might<00:03:03.669> be<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:04.030> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
personally I think they might be going a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.670 
personally I think they might be going a
little<00:03:04.239> far<00:03:04.510> saying<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.959> that's<00:03:05.139> crafting

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
little far saying that that's crafting

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.319 
little far saying that that's crafting
your<00:03:05.709> own<00:03:05.919> stories<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.760> really<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.150> your

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329

your own stories that's really just your
gameplay<00:03:07.719> experience<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.349> my<00:03:08.469> opinion<00:03:08.709> not

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:09.219 
gameplay experience in my opinion not

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.610 
gameplay experience in my opinion not
really<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.579> story<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.419> say<00:03:10.629> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.349> they<00:03:11.439> may

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
really a story for say I think they may

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.409 
really a story for say I think they may
be<00:03:11.650> over<00:03:12.040> glorifying<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.760> just<00:03:12.969> a<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.060> there

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
be over glorifying it just a bit there

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.360 
be over glorifying it just a bit there
anyways<00:03:14.230> they<00:03:14.409> said<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> second<00:03:15.099> kind<00:03:15.219> of

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
anyways they said the second kind of

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.069 
anyways they said the second kind of
story<00:03:15.609> you'll<00:03:15.819> be<00:03:15.939> telling<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.419> one<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:16.840> wear

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
detail we really didn't go into too much

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.649 
detail we really didn't go into too much
was<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:24.129> variety<00:03:24.609> of<00:03:24.639> looks<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.209> combat

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
was just a variety of looks and combat

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.449 
was just a variety of looks and combat
abilities<00:03:26.139> that<00:03:26.290> you'll<00:03:26.409> have<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.979> so<00:03:27.340> when

you encounter someone in a public space

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.210 
you encounter someone in a public space
they're<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.439> look<00:03:29.590> different<00:03:29.620> from<00:03:29.979> you

quite<00:03:33.099> different<00:03:33.549> from<00:03:33.669> a<00:03:33.819> characterization

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
quite different from a characterization

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.569 
quite different from a characterization

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
we mentioned it before but just the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.809

ability to customize your character so

really want to learn more about now loot
drops<00:03:57.549> were<00:03:57.729> already<00:03:58.030> pretty<00:03:58.299> much<00:03:58.540> confirmed

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
drops were already pretty much confirmed

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.110 
drops were already pretty much confirmed
as<00:03:59.290> were<00:03:59.650> rewards<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.519> they<00:04:00.639> once<00:04:00.849> again

as were rewards but they once again

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.780 
as were rewards but they once again
reiterated<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.900> here<00:04:02.290> they<00:04:02.949> also<00:04:03.099> said<00:04:03.430> we

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
reiterated that here they also said we

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.429 
reiterated that here they also said we
talked<00:04:04.030> about<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.419> tower<00:04:04.629> and<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.019> ability

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
talked about the tower and the ability

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.800 
talked about the tower and the ability
to<00:04:05.590> buy<00:04:05.739> things<00:04:05.799> like<00:04:06.280> ships<00:04:06.609> now<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.659> was

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
to buy things like ships now it was

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.569 
to buy things like ships now it was
already<00:04:08.199> pretty<00:04:08.590> much<00:04:08.859> confirmed<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.489> we

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
already pretty much confirmed that we

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.129 
already pretty much confirmed that we
could<00:04:09.729> buy<00:04:09.879> ships<00:04:10.209> but<00:04:10.449> now<00:04:10.659> we<00:04:10.720> have<00:04:10.810> even

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
could buy ships but now we have even

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.289 
could buy ships but now we have even
more<00:04:11.199> proof<00:04:11.560> anyways<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.549> also<00:04:12.669> said<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.269> I

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
more proof anyways they also said so I

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.849 
more proof anyways they also said so I
don't<00:04:13.599> think<00:04:13.780> it's<00:04:13.930> too<00:04:14.109> far<00:04:14.319> of<00:04:14.409> a<00:04:14.470> leap<00:04:14.650> to

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
don't think it's too far of a leap to

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.499 
don't think it's too far of a leap to
assume<00:04:14.979> that<00:04:15.400> you'll<00:04:15.519> be<00:04:15.639> able<00:04:15.759> to<00:04:15.879> buy<00:04:16.030> gear

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
assume that you'll be able to buy gear

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.300 
assume that you'll be able to buy gear
and<00:04:16.720> weapons<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.259> the<00:04:17.380> same<00:04:17.590> way<00:04:17.799> shape<00:04:18.130> or

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
and weapons in the same way shape or

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.550 
and weapons in the same way shape or
form<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.389> that's<00:04:19.570> kind<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.930> given<00:04:20.229> but<00:04:20.409> now

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
form so that's kind of a given but now

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.899 
form so that's kind of a given but now
we<00:04:20.620> pretty<00:04:20.859> much<00:04:20.949> have<00:04:21.219> proof<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.519> you'll<00:04:21.789> be

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
we pretty much have proof that you'll be

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.399 
we pretty much have proof that you'll be
able<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.120> purchase<00:04:22.360> things<00:04:22.659> in<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.960> tower<00:04:23.139> or

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
able to purchase things in the tower or

unfortunately<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.720> answer<00:04:38.840> didn't<00:04:39.410> seem<00:04:39.560> too

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
unfortunately the answer didn't seem too

hopeful<00:04:40.160> for<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.490> they<00:04:40.970> said<00:04:41.240> we<00:04:41.600> haven't

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
hopeful for this they said we haven't

talked<00:04:42.139> about<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.560> any<00:04:42.830> formal<00:04:43.280> way<00:04:43.460> but

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
talked about this in any formal way but

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.370 
talked about this in any formal way but
that's<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.000> great<00:04:44.180> question<00:04:44.389> if<00:04:44.990> i<00:04:45.139> were<00:04:45.260> to

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
that's a great question if i were to

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.840 
that's a great question if i were to
think<00:04:45.560> about<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.860> for<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.040> second<00:04:46.430> I'd<00:04:46.580> say<00:04:46.820> we

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
think about it for a second I'd say we

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.580 
think about it for a second I'd say we
really<00:04:47.419> aren't<00:04:47.570> planning<00:04:47.900> at<00:04:48.080> this<00:04:48.230> point<00:04:48.470> to

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
really aren't planning at this point to

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.200 
really aren't planning at this point to
do<00:04:48.710> many<00:04:48.919> call<00:04:49.160> outs<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:49.580> references<00:04:50.060> to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
do many call outs or references to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.970 
do many call outs or references to
things<00:04:50.330> we've<00:04:50.570> done<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.990> mean<00:04:51.500> one<00:04:51.710> for

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
things we've done I mean one for

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.340 
things we've done I mean one for
practical<00:04:52.430> reasons<00:04:52.460> we<00:04:53.270> don't<00:04:53.450> own<00:04:53.660> halo<00:04:54.080> it's

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
practical reasons we don't own halo it's

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.530 
practical reasons we don't own halo it's
not<00:04:54.500> our<00:04:54.560> thing<00:04:54.830> anymore<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.520> we<00:04:55.669> can't<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.510> I

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
not our thing anymore so we can't but I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.300 
not our thing anymore so we can't but I
think<00:04:56.630> more<00:04:56.960> importantly<00:04:57.110> we're<00:04:57.830> all<00:04:57.980> eager

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
think more importantly we're all eager

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.860 
think more importantly we're all eager
to<00:04:58.400> create<00:04:58.700> something<00:04:58.940> that's<00:04:59.090> big<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.510> new

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
to create something that's big and new

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.870 
to create something that's big and new
and<00:05:00.110> spawns<00:05:00.560> its<00:05:00.800> own<00:05:00.950> references<00:05:01.550> over<00:05:01.760> the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
and spawns its own references over the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.610 
and spawns its own references over the
years<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.389> really<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.169> something<00:05:03.410> that's

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
years and really do something that's

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.260 
years and really do something that's
distinct<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.310> stands<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.760> its<00:05:04.880> own<00:05:05.000> two<00:05:05.240> feet

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
distinct and stands on its own two feet

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.150 
distinct and stands on its own two feet
so<00:05:06.260> they're<00:05:06.410> not<00:05:06.500> saying<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.889> there<00:05:07.010> won't

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
so they're not saying that there won't

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.830 
so they're not saying that there won't
be<00:05:07.370> anything<00:05:07.610> but<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.270> definitely<00:05:08.419> doesn't

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
be anything but it definitely doesn't

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.659 
be anything but it definitely doesn't
sound<00:05:09.139> too<00:05:09.320> promising<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:10.040> hope<00:05:10.370> they<00:05:10.490> can<00:05:10.610> get

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
sound too promising I hope they can get

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:11.860 
sound too promising I hope they can get
around<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:10.970> legalities<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.540> at<00:05:11.600> least<00:05:11.690> put

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
around the legalities to at least put

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.810 
around the legalities to at least put
some<00:05:11.930> easter<00:05:12.440> egg<00:05:12.560> in<00:05:12.680> there<00:05:12.830> though<00:05:13.040> moving

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
some easter egg in there though moving

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.550 
some easter egg in there though moving

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
go into too much detail but they

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.570 
go into too much detail but they
basically<00:05:21.440> said<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.740> grog<00:05:22.100> knock<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.490> an

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
basically said that grog knock is an

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.370 
basically said that grog knock is an
amazing<00:05:23.030> piece<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.210> technology<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:24.050> it

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
amazing piece of technology and it

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.930 
amazing piece of technology and it
allows<00:05:24.650> them<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.860> create<00:05:25.160> awesome<00:05:25.400> worlds

allows them to create awesome worlds

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.580 
allows them to create awesome worlds
really<00:05:26.150> quickly<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.660> easily<00:05:26.810> saving<00:05:27.500> the

thing<00:05:29.870> in<00:05:30.139> this<00:05:30.229> article<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:30.770> found<00:05:31.039> quite

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
thing in this article that I found quite

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.490 
thing in this article that I found quite
cool<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.760> that<00:05:32.060> Destiny's<00:05:32.750> cinematics<00:05:33.350> will

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
cool is that Destiny's cinematics will

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.020 
cool is that Destiny's cinematics will
reflect<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:34.010> current<00:05:34.220> time<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.610> day<00:05:34.760> in<00:05:34.940> the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
reflect the current time of day in the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.060 
reflect the current time of day in the
world<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.990> an<00:05:36.080> example<00:05:36.169> might<00:05:36.620> be<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.919> get

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
world so an example might be you get

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.770 
world so an example might be you get
into<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:37.310> long<00:05:37.580> cinematic<00:05:38.150> right<00:05:38.330> at<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.539> sun's

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
into a long cinematic right at the sun's

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.690 
into a long cinematic right at the sun's
going<00:05:39.080> down<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.500> then<00:05:39.740> as<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.100> cinematic<00:05:40.550> is

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
going down and then as the cinematic is

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.190 
going down and then as the cinematic is
playing<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.300> Sun<00:05:41.479> keeps<00:05:41.720> going<00:05:41.930> down<00:05:42.080> it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
playing the Sun keeps going down it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.900 
playing the Sun keeps going down it
actually<00:05:42.410> will<00:05:42.800> get<00:05:42.919> dark<00:05:43.190> in<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.430> cinematic

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
actually will get dark in the cinematic

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.580 
actually will get dark in the cinematic
I<00:05:44.090> thought<00:05:44.539> that<00:05:44.600> was<00:05:44.780> pretty<00:05:44.990> awesome<00:05:45.140> and<00:05:45.560> I

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
I thought that was pretty awesome and I
