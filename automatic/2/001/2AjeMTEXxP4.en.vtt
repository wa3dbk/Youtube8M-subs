a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.640> lost<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> league<00:00:24.779> actually

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
a lot and I lost in that league actually

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.279 
a lot and I lost in that league actually
because<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.710> didn't<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.369> him<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.960> week

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
because I didn't have him so this week

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
because I didn't have him so this week
he<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> coming<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.119> bye<00:00:30.390> week<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.050> he

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
he is coming off of the bye week so he

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
he is coming off of the bye week so he
should<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.949> rested<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.630> Saints<00:00:33.989> are

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
should be very rested and the Saints are

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.670 
should be very rested and the Saints are
coming<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> their<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.610> loss<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
coming off of their first loss so I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.799 
coming off of their first loss so I
think<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> should<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> little

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
think that that should get them a little

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.619 
think that that should get them a little
bit<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.410> motivated<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.149> points<00:00:42.480> up

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
bit more motivated to put some points up

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.560 
bit more motivated to put some points up

this<00:01:11.729> week<00:01:12.000> Buffalo<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.140> allowing<00:01:13.939> 123<00:01:14.939> point

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
this week Buffalo is allowing 123 point

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.190 
this week Buffalo is allowing 123 point
six<00:01:15.990> rushing<00:01:16.890> yards<00:01:17.310> per<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:19.020> only

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
ranked 21st against the past so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
ranked 21st against the past so
Buffalo's<00:01:22.229> defense<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.460> getting<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> done

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
Buffalo's defense is not getting it done

I think Drew Brees and company is going

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.780 
I think Drew Brees and company is going
to<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> field<00:01:27.810> day<00:01:28.020> against<00:01:28.740> Buffalo<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

more<00:02:12.190> around<00:02:12.520> 20<00:02:13.090> Brady<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.840> very<00:02:14.350> very<00:02:14.890> happy

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
more around 20 Brady is very very happy

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.150 
more around 20 Brady is very very happy
to<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.640> him<00:02:15.910> back<00:02:16.230> grant<00:02:17.230> also<00:02:17.380> came<00:02:17.860> out<00:02:18.040> of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
to have him back grant also came out of

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.450 
to have him back grant also came out of
the<00:02:18.220> game<00:02:18.400> feeling<00:02:19.000> very<00:02:19.360> good<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.020> he<00:02:20.740> had<00:02:20.890> 17

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
the game feeling very good and he had 17

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.700 
the game feeling very good and he had 17
targets<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.570> only<00:02:23.500> played<00:02:23.740> 51<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:25.050> 79<00:02:26.050> snaps

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
targets and only played 51 of 79 snaps

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.710 
targets and only played 51 of 79 snaps
so<00:02:27.460> because<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.910> feels<00:02:28.090> good<00:02:28.360> they're<00:02:28.600> gonna

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
so because it feels good they're gonna

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.840 
so because it feels good they're gonna
have<00:02:28.900> him<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> field<00:02:29.470> more<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.190> week<00:02:30.490> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
have him on the field more this week and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.400 
have him on the field more this week and
I<00:02:31.420> think<00:02:31.630> he's<00:02:31.720> going<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.080> target

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
I think he's going to be a target

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.340 
I think he's going to be a target
monster<00:02:33.070> again<00:02:33.550> for<00:02:33.940> Brady<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.320> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
monster again for Brady and this is a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.710 
monster again for Brady and this is a
division<00:02:35.830> game<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.550> Patriots<00:02:36.730> need<00:02:37.510> to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
division game that the Patriots need to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.220 
division game that the Patriots need to
win<00:02:37.930> they<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.650> lost<00:02:38.920> against<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> jets<00:02:40.230> that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
win they just lost against the jets that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.930 
win they just lost against the jets that
was<00:02:41.440> very<00:02:41.710> unexpected<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.520> think<00:02:42.790> for

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
was very unexpected I think for

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.120 
was very unexpected I think for
everybody<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.750> they<00:02:43.990> need<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.320> win<00:02:44.470> against

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
everybody so they need to win against

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.820 
everybody so they need to win against

that's going to open up their passing
game<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.740> lot<00:03:24.310> now<00:03:25.270> he's<00:03:25.900> averaging<00:03:26.470> 12<00:03:26.980> fantasy

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
game a lot now he's averaging 12 fantasy

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
playing in Denver and even though Denver

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.120 
playing in Denver and even though Denver
had<00:03:52.209> their<00:03:52.390> first<00:03:52.600> loss<00:03:52.900> they<00:03:53.260> still<00:03:53.830> put<00:03:54.070> up

had their first loss they still put up

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.330 
had their first loss they still put up
33<00:03:54.940> points<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.170> rg3<00:03:56.770> is<00:03:56.830> going<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.070> have<00:03:57.190> to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
33 points so rg3 is going to have to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.300 
33 points so rg3 is going to have to
make<00:03:57.459> some<00:03:57.520> magic<00:03:57.940> happen<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.900> here<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.950> going

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
to be the guy I think that he's going to

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.160 
to be the guy I think that he's going to
be<00:04:02.470> going<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:03.040> most<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:03.940> day<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.870> those<00:04:05.140> are

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
be going to most of the day so those are
