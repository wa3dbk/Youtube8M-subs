about<00:01:30.950> 0.1<00:01:31.950> pounds<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> weight<00:01:33.450> difference

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
about 0.1 pounds of weight difference

about 0.1 pounds of weight difference
which<00:01:34.259> i<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.680> astonishing<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
which i think is astonishing for the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.770 
which i think is astonishing for the
price<00:01:35.640> difference<00:01:35.970> between<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.540> cranks

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
price difference between the two cranks

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
price difference between the two cranks
these<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.590> great<00:01:37.860> budget<00:01:38.280> alternative<00:01:38.759> for

I doubt you're gonna notice any loss in
stiffness<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
stiffness so that's it
