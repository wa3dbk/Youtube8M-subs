00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
next pattern that we're going to do is

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.100 
next pattern that we're going to do is
an<00:00:10.830> underarm<00:00:11.099> turn<00:00:11.670> most<00:00:12.240> dances<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.870> many

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
an underarm turn most dances have many

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499 
an underarm turn most dances have many
underarm<00:00:13.650> turns<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> basic<00:00:15.000> underarm

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
underarm turns this is a basic underarm

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.200 
underarm turns this is a basic underarm
turn<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.740> waltz<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.340> they're<00:00:17.970> very

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
turn in the waltz and they're very

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
turn in the waltz and they're very
simple<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.260> happens<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.369> this

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
simple what happens is that here in this

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.029 
simple what happens is that here in this
case<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> man<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> actually

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
case the man is going to actually

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.130 
case the man is going to actually
continue<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.519> his<00:00:23.730> box<00:00:24.029> step<00:00:24.420> while<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
continue to do his box step while the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.990 
continue to do his box step while the
lady<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.070> who<00:00:26.220> does<00:00:26.430> most<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
lady is the one who does most of the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
lady is the one who does most of the
underarm<00:00:27.480> turns<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
underarm turns so this is going to be

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.009 
underarm turns so this is going to be
very<00:00:29.550> simple<00:00:29.910> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> demonstrate<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
very simple I'm going to demonstrate it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.690 
very simple I'm going to demonstrate it
first<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:32.579> is

first and then what I'm going to do is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
first and then what I'm going to do is
break<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> individual<00:00:34.020> pieces<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
break down the individual pieces so

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.500 
break down the individual pieces so
first<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> demonstration<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> Box<00:00:38.340> step

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.240 

and<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> underarm<00:00:45.480> turn<00:00:48.770> back<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and then the underarm turn back to the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.500 
and then the underarm turn back to the
Box<00:00:50.489> step

the box one two three no rotation as she
starts<00:02:03.630> under<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.170> two<00:02:04.830> three<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.119> come

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
starts under one two three and we come

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.139 
starts under one two three and we come
back<00:02:06.539> together<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:08.099> next<00:02:08.399> half<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> the
