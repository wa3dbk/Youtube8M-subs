00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello and welcome to this workshop dsq 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.040
 years the count in this capsule 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 I will show you how to manufacture 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.050
 a brass the heavy fishtail type or 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.480
 fishtail 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 allied of the wolf pilou mme kit here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 so we need the plateau of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 mounting and more particularly two 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.059
 stems only from the stems of our 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 platter we also need 50 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.700
 elastic to allow us to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 to make an adult type bracelet 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.370
 so to make the bracelet I'm going 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.010
 you demonstrate me I chose to 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 take three colors so we take 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.260
 like years taking the first color 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.690
 so for me it is the orange 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 we take our elastic and have made a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 shape of eight as it is here we see 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.989
 installed on our board so the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.770
 first magnifying glass of the 8 on a first 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.990
 stems and the second on the 2nd cij 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.950
 so we see that we keep the shape of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 eight like this one we go down one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 little bit we bring our second 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 color so me too is the blue 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.290
 we install without doing any 8 around 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.650
 of the two stems above so above 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.560
 of the color orange 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.810
 we also take our third color 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.740
 being installed in the same way so the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.170
 disappointed to be blue elastic and around 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.670
 two judges without this 8 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 time here so the elastics follow 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.180
 only the first elastic must be 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 is in the form 8 all the following 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.200
 will only be around both stems 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.649
 this way so once we have 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 three elastic on nothing it takes 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.340
 start hanging a rubber band 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.680
 so in the case here we have to take the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.829
 last elastic so the orange like 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.140
 this one we take it makes it happen 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.619
 over the others we remove it from the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 stem 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.819
 so we let him down on the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.270
 elastic in the middle and we do the same 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.610
 thing on the other side 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.250
 the prince does not go over the stem and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.470
 we let it fall as it is so 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 you see the shape that it gives is this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.410
 we're going to do next is we're going 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.880
 add new ones another one and there 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.440
 so it's less you gave that I 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.010
 three colors I will add some 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.410
 new an orange elastic without doing 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 the shape of eight so only in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.980
 going over both stems as 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.560
 this here so since I have three 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 alas and I have to pick up here so we 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.140
 is made to the blue color game the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.370
 picks up the first straight stems and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:01.120
 I'm going to the left to pick him up too 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.710
 middle of this way so if we can 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.210
 always pushed back the elastics var the 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.740
 boss is easier to insert the 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.300
 following elastics without mixing the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.030
 colors to be sure to keep our 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.470
 fishtail shape like this 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.510
 so now I have two elastics I 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.020
 am going to add a third so I am 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.700
 returned to the blue color as it is 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.590
 if I do not it's the turn of the two 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:27.090
 stems and I'm going to hang up the last 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.260
 elastic I pass it over 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.260
 as blindness aside 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.330
 and so I continue by adding a 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.660
 third elastic and then the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.320
 withdraw so I add the third one 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.390
 yellow color and I'm going to look for the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.900
 last elastic I'm doing it through 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.960
 on the stem to the right then to the left 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.580
 like that here we continue this way 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.880
 add to it always has a third 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.209
 elastic is so three elastic 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.890
 so I'm going to get the last 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:11.130
 the more we start to really see the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.489
 fishtail shape 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.260
 so we continue here for 50 elastic 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.560
 so here's what it gives you once 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.260
 the 50 elastic installed on your lung 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.840
 like these have only once 50 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.850
 elastic installed I will show you 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.980
 how to close the bracelet for pat the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.090
 elastic escapes 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:43.440
 so we have to take a little clasp 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:43.440
 s shape like this one we see shoot 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.970
 on our elastic and we will go 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.830
 to hang here is winter so the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.890
 last we dropped like these 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.500
 we want to hang them in the first 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:01.600
 missed from our s as it is here 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.910
 so at this end the bracelet is 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.820
 totally closed like this one so we 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.310
 can only pick him up two out 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.220
 our mounting board so both 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.780
 last of the sic was not hanging on 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.600
 can only actresses and supplair 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.419
 superfluous one wishes end is 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.460
 finished we will go get the first 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.390
 is here we have dropped here 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:31.229
 their range so that makes the end on 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:34.290
 the draws and we go the series our 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.390
 second miss two aces like this here 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:42.139
 to close it see here the closing 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.969
 is installed and that's it 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.249
 no more complicated than that to make a 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:52.639
 fishtail bracelet or fishtail 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.150
 like this one using the pylons 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.680
 quits 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.680
 thanks and see you next time
