the<00:00:17.820> segments<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.330> compare<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.439> audio

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the segments was compare the audio

more high response just to accommodate
or<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> fact<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.270> you're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
or make up for the fact that you're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
or make up for the fact that you're
recording<00:01:21.720> underneath<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> shirt<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.619> has<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
frequencies and this is what this sounds

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
frequencies and this is what this sounds
like<00:01:26.939> again<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> zoom<00:01:27.900> h1<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.560> this

about<00:01:59.780> $2,000<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.259> point<00:02:01.469> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
about $2,000 I think at this point it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.730 
about $2,000 I think at this point it
ran<00:02:02.329> 2300<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.570> when<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> bought<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490 
ran 2300 I think when I bought it so
it's<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> decent<00:02:05.250> quality<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:06.240> camera<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
it's a decent quality my camera but it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.270
