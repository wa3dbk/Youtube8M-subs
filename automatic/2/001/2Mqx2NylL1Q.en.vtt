00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.970
 My name is Miyashita Yoshina of Advanced Media Science Department . 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.970
 Hmm 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.199
 My specialty is human computer interaction and entertainment 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.380
 Computing 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.859
 is 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.779
 Toka is exciting the people without'm just ease of use 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:30.489
 Not only material richness but such a computer that contributes to spiritual richness 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.400
 I think about the way 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 Let's talk about media that extend human expressive ability today 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.940
 black 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.870
 In the past, live broadcasting of video was only possible for television stations 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.990
 But we can do it with one cell phone 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.060
 Also 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.900
 In the old days only professional music producers can offer music to female vocalists 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.440
 It was 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:05.600
 But now everyone is playing their songs on the computer 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.680
 It is possible to say that you let me sing with female vocals, that is new 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 media 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 Until now, publishers and television stations and so on with the power of such things 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.140
 It's such that we are getting the had only Confessional people power 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 Ne 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.920
 Our aim is to create more and more media that extend that expressive ability 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.280
 It is research 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
 Uu 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:37.259
 For example, because the presentation is that there is no edge only about representative Sato or scholar of companies 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 I tend to think that but I want to make it a more general expression means and make it evolve more 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.900
 The Fu say you want and we think where a new presentation style 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.710
 It is proposed that the traditional presentation is one and two of the presenters 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.610
 Because green is peeled off , expression of presenter 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.170
 It is not easily transmitted to the audience gesture sometimes is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.210
 So we are in this kind of Fu 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 Can you not be united with the contents of the presentation so that the presenter stands in front of the screen ? 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.450
 I thought the wind to say 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.489
 Well also certainly Fu say Thats would be near If you wait too long and standing in front of made that way 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.890
 I think you will be worried about 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.640
 But in fact it is okay at such time that it is better if the characters avoid this way 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 is 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 If say're stopped seen in such Fu on top of the projector 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:32.709
 It is you ride to the sensor which is originally sensor made for the game 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.180
 Our system obtains data from this sensor and calculates the presenter's silhouette 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.630
 And every single letter or object in the slide 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 Do not overlap the silhouette 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.640
 Is calculating the optimal position 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 What is there is a feeling that the real thrill I mean is say I'm themselves are making the future in research 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.330
 It is a thing 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.660
 I'm not afraid to imagine what the future will be like 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.780
 I'm thinking about what kind of future 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.910
 I think such a sense is something that has never been studied before 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:15.190
 In the Advanced Media Science Department, the activities that make up the future are learning itself 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:19.350
 Preach the exam study answer that is provided Toka to memorize the existing academic system like a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.530
 I want you to come to everyone who is fried to such things 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.530
 2 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.400
 Originally textbooks Toka solve the outstanding issues of Tteyuu University a new page + to say so 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.569
 It is a place to do 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.569
 Let's create a new future together and strengthen innovation in society
