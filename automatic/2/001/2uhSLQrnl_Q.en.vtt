00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:23.720
 here in the alpine region about 120 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 persons per wind energy a 95 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.440
 percent of the victims solve the avalanche 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.440
 yourself out of luck 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.370
 breaks the world together and fully 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:53.700
 down the slope and solve the whole 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:55.320
 hang out the classic skiers 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.610
 avalanche us as a winter sportsman 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.610
 concerns it is snowboard 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.229
 we need the snow for those 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.090
 ingredients on the one hand tailed snow 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.040
 then rather weak one 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.960
 additional burden and finally must 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.659
 adjust the tilt which should more than 30 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.520
 So be grad at certain 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.049
 additional load in hagen is also increasing 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.970
 danger of a release such as 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.340
 for example, a fall in jump or 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.220
 several people if your husband is not sure 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.140
 or just the circumstances are good 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.539
 then I have to be very defensive 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.189
 behave when we are a skier 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.390
 we are already releasing a snowboard 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.280
 in the middle of this system 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.350
 we have a sharp-edged crack 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.259
 the area below us breaks in immediately 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.659
 sound velocity in schools from the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.700
 snow slides off warms up in the finish 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.970
 and freezes at standstill again 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.970
 emphasize 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 if you knew fresh else from that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.450
 snow principle then usually means that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 big avalanche danger 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.470
 it is a misconception that he is safe 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.470
 when the snow masses are already down 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.030
 here the origin of them depends on 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.250
 different factors from the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.039
 conditions of snow cover construction 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.660
 but mainly from us humans 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.570
 how we behave and how he behaves 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.370
 move in terrain the first day after 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.350
 the long bad weather period is 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.340
 mostly and typical bluebay erich 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.440
 hausers chat 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.580
 but for me the day was summed up 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 most dangerous in the season 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 It is important that the weather 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.880
 you have to know how much wind you have 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.410
 the snow has gone 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.360
 shifted how cold was 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 if you really with little risk on 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.760
 mountain want to be on the road then you have to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.760
 to prepare well 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.870
 the weather is of course whole 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.120
 crucial for the avalanche danger 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.730
 one of the most important factors is the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.340
 winter is considered a builder of avalanches 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.260
 simply explained the wind blows the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.659
 snow from the air side to the le side 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 and there arises at this famous 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.590
 notorious drifting snow 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.300
 how do you recognize wind activity? 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 guard on wind angel ammann room on 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.410
 a summit cross and for the current one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.330
 Wind always best on the snow 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.620
 flags like the ridges and helmets 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.450
 snowfall means painting out 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 fresh snow and of course powder and fun 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.200
 but sometimes can be ten inches 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.730
 be very dangerous on the other hand 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.620
 can even be that half a meter 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.489
 New snow is extremely safe and fun 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 makes those snowfalls impact that 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.570
 depends on several factors from to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.130
 example would be favorable if during the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.590
 snowfall is no wind and if the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.930
 temperatures are just under zero degrees 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.790
 rather unfavorable when there is strong wind 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.500
 or when the temperatures are very low 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 are the last years accordingly 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.130
 negative from yes if the conditions 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 unfavorable are that means if the whole 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.140
 pronounced weak layer was pleasant 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.580
 without further 10 to 20 cm fresh snow have 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.590
 is the favorable conditions that is 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.950
 a stable snowpack construction no 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.380
 Vienna 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.700
 then the 30 to 60 cm of fresh snow 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.700
 space and no problem 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.180
 So next to precipitation also has the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.319
 Temperature influence on the strength 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.480
 from the snowfall 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.890
 that is, as much as they used him 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.600
 Just look that sooner 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.070
 first of all, break up the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.720
 to catch perfect stuffing and 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.880
 Second, I am at home 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.240
 before the sunshine the whole 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.710
 come up snow 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.150
 The snowfall alone is not called 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.500
 automatically that it is dangerous 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.000
 the decisive factor is always the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.380
 snow cover construction, there are always 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.330
 weak layers are crucial too 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.970
 the wind action so you have to 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.960
 Note the days before 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.760
 in the snowfall always finds one 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.880
 Temperature exchange takes place in autumn 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.160
 the floor will be warm 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.270
 snowed in and the warm temperature 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.790
 always goes up 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.320
 through this exchange of water vapor 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.780
 from the ground to the snow surface 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.300
 find change in the snowpack too 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.400
 transformation processes city speak as soon as possible 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.800
 I harpstedt a harder layer here 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 the water vapor and it comes 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.960
 possibly too weak 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.960
 layers education 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.100
 a bit of experience you can quickly 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.980
 the terrain is correct to read and better 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.870
 To estimate areas we troughs 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.330
 and steep crashes are special 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.670
 predestined for driving snow on the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.940
 store the particularly easy to storm 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.140
 therefore, they are inbound back 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.460
 perfect for ascents and descents of the 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.380
 You can actually do wind activity in the 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.880
 terrain of a little exercise and experience 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.990
 has recognized very well 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.240
 you look like that, for example 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.010
 Terrain where darwin specifically the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.990
 snow from camp children knew about 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.570
 for example or in gutters and troughs 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.490
 where then the snow is deposited that 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.470
 you can already watch very well 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.060
 The case will be and important 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.370
 also who does not have this experience 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.930
 simply on the avalanche situation report 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.060
 there is always mentioned where 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.130
 one currently has particular problems where 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.130
 the drifting snow fall mark was stored 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.840
 70 percent of avalanche accidents occur 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.550
 in north exposed terrain 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.290
 the reason for this is the slow implementation 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.980
 the snowpack was the avalanche danger 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.960
 conserves a massive influence 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.880
 but the avalanche danger has also the 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.330
 slope inclination which is also reflected in 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.160
 the number of avalanche accidents again 190 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.840
 percent of all avalanche accidents occur 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:31.990
 in a terrain over 30 degrees about 84 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.930
 even a terrain over 35 degrees 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.240
 and the little thought support you can 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.580
 namely the Spitzkeke take off 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.610
 a terrain steinheid of about 30 degrees 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.060
 you start automatically in the slope 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.060
 make a turn 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.600
 in the end, it always feels like me 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.520
 my decisions my knowledge about mine 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.640
 Trade begins with the risk 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.640
 minimize
