so Chris what were you thinking when you
started<00:00:15.629> an<00:00:15.840> idea<00:00:16.289> designing

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
started an idea designing

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.700 
started an idea designing
the<00:00:19.939> first<00:00:20.210> thing<00:00:20.419> was<00:00:20.660> make<00:00:21.169> it<00:00:21.289> better<00:00:21.500> than

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
the first thing was make it better than

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.359 
the first thing was make it better than
everybody<00:00:21.919> else's<00:00:22.429> and<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:24.710> next<00:00:24.919> part<00:00:25.189> of<00:00:25.250> it

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
everybody else's and the next part of it

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.650 
everybody else's and the next part of it
was<00:00:25.550> make<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.210> scale<00:00:26.539> as<00:00:26.750> possible

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.359 

the<00:00:30.110> next<00:00:30.380> part<00:00:30.500> of<00:00:30.650> it<00:00:30.770> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the next part of it was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:54.810 
the next part of it was
making<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.120 

you<00:00:55.820> know<00:00:55.940> anybody<00:00:56.450> can<00:00:56.510> have<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.989> drive<00:00:57.800> it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.490 

have<00:01:00.400> a<00:01:00.430> good<00:01:00.580> time<00:01:00.760> with<00:01:00.970> it

enjoy<00:01:03.800> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.140 

remain<00:01:06.750> criteria

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810 

I<00:01:15.240> think<00:01:16.230> bikes<00:01:16.440> are<00:01:16.740> definitely<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.730> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I think bikes are definitely going to be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.010 
I think bikes are definitely going to be
a<00:01:17.850> bug

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a bug

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
a bug
I<00:01:19.079> guess<00:01:19.649> you<00:01:19.770> call<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:19.979> mainstream<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.820> our

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I guess you call it mainstream for our

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.469 
I guess you call it mainstream for our
industry<00:01:21.350> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:23.340> bike<00:01:23.490> design<00:01:23.880> has<00:01:24.179> come<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
industry I think bike design has come a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140 
industry I think bike design has come a
long<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.929> I<00:01:25.109> think<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.130> certainly<00:01:26.340> help

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
long way I think we can certainly help

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.900 
long way I think we can certainly help
as<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> company<00:01:27.630> push<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.610> technology<00:01:29.610> forward

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
as a company push the technology forward

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.120 
as a company push the technology forward
I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.510> manufacturers<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.470> doing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I think other manufacturers are doing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.610 
I think other manufacturers are doing
the<00:01:32.220> best<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.730> to<00:01:33.180> support<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.690> then

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
the best they can to to support it then

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.110 
the best they can to to support it then
you've<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> private<00:01:36.030> individuals

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
you've got a lot of private individuals

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.540 
you've got a lot of private individuals
developing<00:01:37.050> stuffs<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.440> think<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.190> bikes<00:01:38.400> are

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
developing stuffs i think the bikes are

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.650 
developing stuffs i think the bikes are
here<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> stay<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.000> sure<00:01:39.300> and<00:01:39.480> they're<00:01:39.630> only

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
here to stay for sure and they're only

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:57.280 
here to stay for sure and they're only
get<00:01:39.900> better

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.720 

dirt<00:01:58.290> bikes<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.770> been<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.100> tough

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
dirt bikes have been a really tough

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.380 
dirt bikes have been a really tough
subject<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.750> tackle<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.650> think<00:02:02.120> our<00:02:03.120> bike

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
subject to tackle and I think our bike

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.070 
subject to tackle and I think our bike
is<00:02:03.690> his<00:02:04.620> stands<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> best<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.630> what's

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
is his stands to be the best of what's

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.230 
is his stands to be the best of what's
available<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.830> market<00:02:08.250> today<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> who<00:02:09.060> knows

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
available in market today and who knows

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.510 
available in market today and who knows
in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.420> future
