each<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> clinches<00:01:26.970> why<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.630 

now<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> trick<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.190> nothing<00:01:32.190> mixing<00:01:32.520> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
now the trick is nothing mixing your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.050 
now the trick is nothing mixing your
punches<00:01:33.060> along<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.050> your<00:01:34.260> your<00:01:35.160> transition

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
punches along with your your transition

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.570 
punches along with your your transition
so<00:01:36.560> most<00:01:37.560> people<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.010> they<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.280> through<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
so most people when they get through the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.930 
so most people when they get through the
ground<00:01:39.500> or<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.130> clinch<00:01:41.460> they'll<00:01:41.700> try<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
ground or in the clinch they'll try to

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.550 
ground or in the clinch they'll try to
transition<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:42.630> away<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.290> doesn't

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
transition right away and if it doesn't

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
transition right away and if it doesn't
work<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.860> speedrun<00:01:44.370> transition<00:01:44.940> well

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
work like a speedrun transition well

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
work like a speedrun transition well
what<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.190> opponent<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
what that does is your opponent the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
what that does is your opponent the
deity<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> time<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.920> he's<00:01:50.070> good<00:01:50.250> at

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
deity of time that and if he's good at

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that either's all the time like he you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.880 
that either's all the time like he you
know<00:02:30.209> when<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.510> takes<00:02:30.630> young<00:02:30.930> issue<00:02:31.440> notice

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
know when it takes young issue notice

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.039 
know when it takes young issue notice
and<00:02:32.070> doing<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> strikes<00:02:32.970> wedded<00:02:33.299> wife<00:02:33.660> right

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
and doing the strikes wedded wife right

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.810 
and doing the strikes wedded wife right
away<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.769> maybe<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.310> first<00:02:35.489> thing<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
away then maybe the first thing you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.009 
away then maybe the first thing you
should<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> fight<00:02:36.600> goes<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
should do in the fight goes to the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.420 
should do in the fight goes to the
ground<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.560> who<00:02:37.650> takes<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.980> down<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
ground for who takes you down is the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.710 
ground for who takes you down is the
transition<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.540> he's

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
transition because you know he's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920 
transition because you know he's
throwing<00:02:40.110> strikes<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.650> away<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.820> if<00:02:41.970> right

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
throwing strikes right away but if right

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.840 
throwing strikes right away but if right
knee<00:02:43.049> chase<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.350> down<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:44.250> he's<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.610> take

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
knee chase you down if he's not take

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.970 
knee chase you down if he's not take
John<00:02:45.090> event<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:46.260> strikes<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.860> there's

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
John event going strikes and there's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
John event going strikes and there's
just<00:02:47.190> sitting<00:02:47.880> there<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.480> means<00:02:48.690> he's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
just sitting there that means he's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.270 
just sitting there that means he's
blocking<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.320> transition<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:49.920> maybe<00:02:50.070> that's

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
blocking your transition so maybe that's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.470 
blocking your transition so maybe that's
a<00:02:50.370> good<00:02:50.400> time<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.120> throw<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.450> your
