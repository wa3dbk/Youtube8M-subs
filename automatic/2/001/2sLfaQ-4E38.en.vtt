00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
hello friends welcome back to Falcon

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.009 
hello friends welcome back to Falcon
cells<00:00:08.849> here<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.300> time<00:00:09.510> I'm<00:00:09.570> bringing

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
cells here and this time I'm bringing

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.259 
cells here and this time I'm bringing
you<00:00:10.139> into<00:00:10.290> my<00:00:10.469> project<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.190> 30<00:00:11.910> minutes

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
you into my project about 30 minutes

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.140 
you into my project about 30 minutes
late<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.710> got<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> date<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:14.820> event

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
late because I got a date of my event

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.900 
late because I got a date of my event
wrong<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.260> figure<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> only<00:00:17.160> had<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> week<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
wrong so I figure I only had a week to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
wrong so I figure I only had a week to
finish<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.330> plane<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> actually<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
finish this plane when I actually have a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
finish this plane when I actually have a
whole<00:00:19.949> month<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:21.029> anyway<00:00:21.330> let<00:00:21.570> me<00:00:21.600> show<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
whole month but anyway let me show you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.750 
whole month but anyway let me show you
what<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.140> doing<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:22.920> far<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.400> am<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
what I'm doing and how far I am on the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
what I'm doing and how far I am on the
project<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.960> course<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.500> thing

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
project and of course the first thing

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.250 
project and of course the first thing
we're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> talk<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> size<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
we're going to talk about is the size of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
we're going to talk about is the size of
the<00:00:28.349> airplane<00:00:28.650> which<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.250> pretty<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.090> did

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the airplane which is pretty much I did

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.980 
the airplane which is pretty much I did
it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
it
you<00:00:31.380> know<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.500> print<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.390> blueprint<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.450> guess

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you know I print this blueprint I guess

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.010 
you know I print this blueprint I guess
we<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.840> call<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.489> based<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> 40<00:00:36.210> size

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
we can call it based on a 40 size

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.350 
we can call it based on a 40 size
paprika<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.640> ready<00:00:38.910> inch

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
paprika which will be ready inch

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560 
paprika which will be ready inch
wingspan<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.290> 50<00:00:40.770> inches<00:00:41.100> fuselage<00:00:41.610> but

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wingspan and 50 inches fuselage but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.000 
wingspan and 50 inches fuselage but
because<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.850> too<00:00:45.120> long<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
because it's a little bit too long I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.209 
because it's a little bit too long I
decided<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> make<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.579> pretty<00:00:48.480> much<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.809> own

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
decided to make it a pretty much my own

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
decided to make it a pretty much my own
version<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> clip<00:00:51.600> wing<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
version of the of the clip wing so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
version of the of the clip wing so
instead<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> doing<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> 80<00:00:53.250> inches<00:00:53.850> wing<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
instead of doing the 80 inches wing I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
instead of doing the 80 inches wing I
went<00:00:55.140> 70<00:00:55.770> inches<00:00:56.039> wing<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
went 70 inches wing I just got the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
went 70 inches wing I just got the
length<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> wings<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.820> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> still

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
length of the wings and which is still

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
length of the wings and which is still
pretty<00:01:00.390> big<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.809> mean<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.079> already<00:01:01.590> build<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pretty big I mean they already build the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty big I mean they already build the
wing<00:01:02.190> zones<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:02.969> that's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
wing zones you can see right here that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.000 
wing zones you can see right here that's
one<00:01:03.629> half<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.250> half<00:01:05.489> over<00:01:05.729> here

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
one half I get this other half over here

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.030 
one half I get this other half over here
you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> long<00:01:09.360> wing<00:01:10.140> there's<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you know that is a long wing there's a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
you know that is a long wing there's a
70<00:01:11.700> inch<00:01:11.880> wingspan<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.659> could<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> fuselage<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
70 inch wingspan of could the fuselage I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
70 inch wingspan of could the fuselage I
left<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> same<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> 40<00:01:15.420> size

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
left at the same you know for a 40 size

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.620 
left at the same you know for a 40 size
and<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.100> wings<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:18.240> simple

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and now this wings are are very simple

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.120 
and now this wings are are very simple
guys<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.900> actually<00:01:19.020> build<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.619> template

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
guys I actually build this template

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
guys I actually build this template
before<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> did<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> wings<00:01:21.180> itself<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.810> saw

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
before I did the wings itself you saw

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
before I did the wings itself you saw
and<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:22.890> idea<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and have an idea what it what the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
and have an idea what it what the
structure<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> inside<00:01:25.530> I'm

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
structure was gonna be like inside I'm

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.499 
structure was gonna be like inside I'm
pretty<00:01:26.580> much<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
pretty much what you see here it's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
pretty much what you see here it's
exactly<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.140> inside<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.560> wing<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.280> main

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
exactly what is inside the wing the main

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.380 
exactly what is inside the wing the main
spar<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.810> double<00:01:31.350> fun<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> France

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
spar is double fun I have a France

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.499 
spar is double fun I have a France
Barbara<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> keep<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> shape<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
Barbara here just to keep the shape and

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
Barbara here just to keep the shape and
spiral<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> argon<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.380> cut<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.150> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
spiral here with the argon is cut and I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.450 
spiral here with the argon is cut and I
actually<00:01:39.570> use<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.079> airfoil<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.159> Clark

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually use this airfoil is the Clark

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually use this airfoil is the Clark
why<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.030> modified<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> back

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
why I modified a little bit on the back

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.190 
why I modified a little bit on the back
of<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> power<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.210> nothing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of it on this power here to nothing

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
of it on this power here to nothing
because<00:01:46.259> he<00:01:46.590> hardly<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.549> much<00:01:47.640> about

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
because he hardly a bit too much about

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149 
because he hardly a bit too much about
cord<00:01:48.149> over<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.829> gonna<00:01:50.009> be

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
cord over here and it was just gonna be

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.370 
cord over here and it was just gonna be
too<00:01:50.310> thick<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
too thick on the back for my two for the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
too thick on the back for my two for the
garden<00:01:52.710> anyway<00:01:53.149> because<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.390> didn't<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
garden anyway because I didn't want to

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
garden anyway because I didn't want to
do<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> way<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> normally<00:01:56.850> on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
do that the way we do it normally on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.100 
do that the way we do it normally on
these<00:01:57.090> flying<00:01:57.360> wings<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
these flying wings you know the way to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
these flying wings you know the way to
the<00:01:58.320> airfoil<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.700> we'll

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the airfoil and them on the back we'll

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
the airfoil and them on the back we'll
just<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.530> piece<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> foam<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just put a piece of foam for the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
just put a piece of foam for the
elements<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.630> works<00:02:03.840> good<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.110> those<00:02:04.350> wings

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
elements it works good on those wings

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
elements it works good on those wings
cuz<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.159> ten<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> really

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
cuz there are ten you know you really

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.010 
cuz there are ten you know you really
can<00:02:06.180> tell<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.600> much

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
can tell you that much

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.650 
can tell you that much
but<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.680> something<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.459> thick<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.360> doesn't

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
but on something this thick that doesn't

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.580 
but on something this thick that doesn't
really<00:02:09.780> good<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.080> great

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
really good a great

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.580 
really good a great
so<00:02:11.340> anyway

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
you know this pretty much a single piece

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.660 
you know this pretty much a single piece
of<00:02:14.840> coral<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.380> firm<00:02:15.620> double<00:02:16.069> seed<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of coral it's firm double seed on the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.780 
of coral it's firm double seed on the
main<00:02:16.850> spar<00:02:17.770> one<00:02:18.770> please<00:02:19.040> rally<00:02:19.280> where<00:02:19.520> would<00:02:19.760> I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
main spar one please rally where would I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.540 
main spar one please rally where would I
decide<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> item<00:02:20.840> was<00:02:20.959> gonna<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.310> try

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
decide the item was gonna be and you try

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.430 
decide the item was gonna be and you try
behind<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.150> pretty<00:02:23.360> much<00:02:23.480> decided<00:02:23.959> what<00:02:24.410> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
behind it pretty much decided what I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.980 
behind it pretty much decided what I
glue<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.250> was<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> half<00:02:26.330> inch<00:02:26.569> square

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
glue on it was a half inch square

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.380 
glue on it was a half inch square
performed<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.490> know<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.850> when<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.180> cut

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
performed you know in that when I cut

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.790 
performed you know in that when I cut
the<00:02:29.480> bevel<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.319> clearance<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
the bevel for the clearance of the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.979 
the bevel for the clearance of the
control<00:02:31.160> surface<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.700> still<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.180> foam<00:02:32.810> back

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
control surface I still have foam back

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.350 
control surface I still have foam back
there<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.800> support<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.489> bottom<00:02:34.880> part<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
there to support this bottom part of the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.840 
there to support this bottom part of the
ion<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.830> plenty<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.160> clearance<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.819> see

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
ion so I have plenty of clearance to see

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.920 
ion so I have plenty of clearance to see
for<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.209> movement<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:41.660> gonna<00:02:41.750> be<00:02:41.900> a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
for the movement and it's gonna be a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.800 
for the movement and it's gonna be a
hardened<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> still<00:02:43.069> be<00:02:43.190> strong<00:02:43.370> enough<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.819> use

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
hardened to still be strong enough I use

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.300 
hardened to still be strong enough I use
the<00:02:44.989> shapes<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.650> off<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.610> only<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.510> the

on the of the cup I have you suck to be

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.150 
on the of the cup I have you suck to be
somewhere<00:02:56.300> pretty<00:02:56.750> much<00:02:56.870> over<00:02:57.019> here<00:02:57.160> listen

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
somewhere pretty much over here listen

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.630 
somewhere pretty much over here listen
here<00:03:01.209> yeah<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.569> see<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:04.130> right<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.459> there

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
here yeah you see it's right in there

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.130 
here yeah you see it's right in there
and<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:05.209> what<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.750> know<00:03:05.810> because

and that's what it's a you know because
brother<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.420> wing<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.959> actually<00:03:09.170> 12

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
brother and the wing is actually 12

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.250 
brother and the wing is actually 12
inches<00:03:10.209> from<00:03:11.209> leading<00:03:11.569> edge<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.930> trailing

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
inches from leading edge to trailing

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.830 
inches from leading edge to trailing
edge<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.370> what<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.610> did<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.209> actually<00:03:14.420> took<00:03:14.720> a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
edge so what I did is actually took a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.470 
edge so what I did is actually took a
full<00:03:15.080> sheet<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.650> foam<00:03:16.010> right<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.760> I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
full sheet of foam right there and I

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.850 
full sheet of foam right there and I
have<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.900> know<00:03:17.989> because<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.380> trim<00:03:18.590> had<00:03:18.739> to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
have you know because of the trim had to

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.949 
have you know because of the trim had to
go<00:03:18.980> out<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.220> each<00:03:19.459> side<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.030> have<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.690> add<00:03:20.720> an

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
go out on each side I have to add an

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.750 
go out on each side I have to add an
extra<00:03:21.410> inch<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.799> half<00:03:21.829> which<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.430> you

the letters you can tell there is a
giant<00:03:31.280> right<00:03:31.370> here<00:03:31.489> which<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.329> pretty<00:03:32.450> much<00:03:32.600> an

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
giant right here which is pretty much an

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.120 
giant right here which is pretty much an
inch<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.110> extra<00:03:33.470> inch<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.769> half<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:34.010> have

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
inch in the extra inch and a half I have

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.229 
inch in the extra inch and a half I have
to<00:03:34.280> add<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.549> sheet<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.880> foam

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
to add to a sheet of foam

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.000 
to add to a sheet of foam
so<00:03:35.930> what<00:03:36.019> either<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.230> take<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> whole<00:03:36.739> sheet

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
so what either you take the whole sheet

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.819 
so what either you take the whole sheet
mark<00:03:37.670> put<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.299> spars<00:03:38.600> on<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.530> word<00:03:39.650> they're

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
mark put the spars on the word they're

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.190 
mark put the spars on the word they're
gonna<00:03:39.920> be<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.610> then<00:03:40.820> fold<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.359> fold<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.930> front

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
gonna be and then fold it fold the front

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.349 
gonna be and then fold it fold the front
of<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.130> it's<00:03:43.579> what<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.760> end<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.060> over<00:03:44.299> here

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
of it so it's what I end up over here

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.509 
of it so it's what I end up over here
you<00:03:44.750> know<00:03:44.840> they<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.140> call<00:03:45.320> shear<00:03:45.620> here<00:03:45.920> and

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
you know they can call shear here and

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.500 
you know they can call shear here and
fold<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.120> over<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.630> over<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:49.510> this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
fold it over this over the the this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.660 
fold it over this over the the this
parts<00:03:50.870> pretty<00:03:50.900> much<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.190> used<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.430> feel

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
parts pretty much and I used to feel

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.060 
parts pretty much and I used to feel
pretty<00:03:52.790> much<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.269> air<00:03:54.170> for<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.799> keep<00:03:54.920> the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
pretty much the air for just to keep the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.160 
pretty much the air for just to keep the
shade<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.280> know<00:03:55.489> but<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.450> will<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.900> winter

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
shade you know but I will see the winter

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.780 
shade you know but I will see the winter
winds<00:03:57.470> were<00:03:57.590> very<00:03:57.769> simple<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.489> course<00:03:58.700> you

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
winds were very simple and of course you

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.920 
winds were very simple and of course you
know<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:58.880> went<00:03:59.030> ahead<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.359> coat<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.600> islands

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
know I went ahead and coat the islands

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.080 
know I went ahead and coat the islands
of<00:04:00.109> it<00:04:00.370> I'll<00:04:01.370> show<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.609> more<00:04:01.820> on<00:04:01.970> them

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
of it I'll show you more on them

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.840 
of it I'll show you more on them
whenever<00:04:02.209> we<00:04:02.510> start<00:04:03.109> working<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.530> wings

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
whenever we start working on the wings

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.949 
whenever we start working on the wings
and<00:04:04.850> that's<00:04:05.090> pretty<00:04:05.239> much<00:04:05.390> all<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.600> have<00:04:05.780> done

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
I'm still working on the fuselage as you

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.009 
I'm still working on the fuselage as you
can<00:04:07.910> see<00:04:08.060> over<00:04:08.269> here<00:04:08.299> huh

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019

I<00:04:09.049> was<00:04:09.980> trying<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.220> figure<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.519> out<00:04:10.579> no<00:04:11.480> my

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
I was trying to figure it out no my

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.160 
I was trying to figure it out no my
bracing<00:04:13.010> inside<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.760> kind<00:04:14.720> of<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:15.140> a

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
bracing inside of it I kind of have a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.440 
bracing inside of it I kind of have a
layout<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.709> way<00:04:15.739> I'm<00:04:15.890> gonna<00:04:16.039> be<00:04:16.489> doing<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.880> and

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
layout the way I'm gonna be doing it and

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.909 
layout the way I'm gonna be doing it and
I<00:04:17.690> actually<00:04:17.780> already<00:04:18.049> won<00:04:18.320> here<00:04:18.530> in<00:04:18.560> cordon

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
I actually already won here in cordon

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.250 
I actually already won here in cordon
haven't<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.640> made<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.000> well<00:04:20.989> anyway

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260

yeah pretty much you see put him
whatever<00:04:24.409> I<00:04:24.590> need<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.860> match

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
whatever I need a match

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.570 
whatever I need a match
they're<00:04:25.850> not<00:04:26.120> from<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.320> specific<00:04:27.560> point<00:04:28.310> like

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
they're not from a specific point like

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.180 
they're not from a specific point like
like<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:29.240> mean<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:30.110> seem<00:04:30.320> they're<00:04:30.770> really<00:04:31.010> not

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
like I mean you seem they're really not

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.860 
like I mean you seem they're really not
random<00:04:31.700> that's<00:04:31.880> what<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.060> trying<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.480> say<00:04:32.660> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
random that's what I'm trying to say I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.570 
random that's what I'm trying to say I
actually<00:04:33.590> put<00:04:33.950> him<00:04:34.040> like<00:04:34.070> one<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.400> break

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
actually put him like one the break

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.370 
actually put him like one the break
points<00:04:34.970> whether<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.540> turn<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:36.020> one<00:04:36.260> over

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
points whether it's a turn this one over

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.510 
points whether it's a turn this one over
here<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.620> one<00:04:36.920> I<00:04:36.980> was<00:04:37.100> going<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> put<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.460> all

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
here this one I was going to put it all

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.790 
here this one I was going to put it all
the<00:04:37.580> way<00:04:37.610> up<00:04:37.700> here<00:04:37.820> but<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:39.080> was<00:04:39.530> gonna<00:04:39.620> leave

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the way up here but I was gonna leave

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.770 
the way up here but I was gonna leave
all<00:04:39.950> these<00:04:40.100> from<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.370> battery<00:04:40.700> bay<00:04:40.820> but<00:04:41.420> I'm

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
all these from a battery bay but I'm

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.260 
all these from a battery bay but I'm
gonna<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.170> using<00:04:42.290> for<00:04:42.620> about<00:04:43.100> 4,000<00:04:43.820> milliamps

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
gonna be using for about 4,000 milliamps

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.720 
gonna be using for about 4,000 milliamps
of<00:04:44.390> battery<00:04:44.720> on<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.740> sale<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.250> think<00:04:46.520> a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
of battery on a for sale so I think a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.390 
of battery on a for sale so I think a
maybe<00:04:46.970> too<00:04:47.330> much<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:47.990> I'm<00:04:48.290> gonna<00:04:48.590> move<00:04:49.220> this

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
maybe too much so I'm gonna move this

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.120 
maybe too much so I'm gonna move this
one<00:04:49.610> back<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:51.020> point<00:04:51.320> all<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.890> way<00:04:51.920> up

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
one back to this point all the way up

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.010 
one back to this point all the way up
here<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:53.180> will<00:04:53.330> give<00:04:53.540> me<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.660> little<00:04:53.900> more

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
here that will give me a little more

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.960 
here that will give me a little more
room<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.500> slam<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.950> buy<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.130> back<00:04:55.490> if<00:04:55.790> I<00:04:55.940> need

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
room to slam I buy this back if I need

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.750 
room to slam I buy this back if I need
to<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.810> course<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:57.170> another<00:04:57.230> turn<00:04:57.680> here<00:04:58.310> put

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
to of course in another turn here put

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.330 
to of course in another turn here put
another<00:04:59.560> another<00:05:00.560> base<00:05:00.800> were<00:05:00.980> there<00:05:01.190> and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
another another base were there and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.380 
another another base were there and
these<00:05:01.490> wrong<00:05:01.730> instructions<00:05:01.970> are<00:05:02.300> there

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
these wrong instructions are there

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.320
