alright here's the side plate plastic
cover<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.870> guess<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:25.280> goes<00:03:25.430> there<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:27.170> then<00:03:27.290> you

cover I guess it goes there and then you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.229 
cover I guess it goes there and then you
remove<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.459> where<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.790> check<00:03:29.090> your

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
remove that that's where you check your

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:39.720 
remove that that's where you check your
oil<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:33.970> back<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.980> for<00:03:36.980> your<00:03:37.130> differential

there you go there's your oil filter so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.050 
there you go there's your oil filter so
fairly<00:04:04.730> easy<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.060> get<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:06.459> come<00:04:07.459> under<00:04:07.760> here

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
fairly easy to get to come under here

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.620 
fairly easy to get to come under here
see<00:04:08.840> if<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.079> can<00:04:09.290> show<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:11.060> drain<00:04:11.389> plug

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
see if I can show you the drain plug

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.789 
see if I can show you the drain plug
there<00:04:11.989> we<00:04:12.079> go<00:04:12.489> there's<00:04:13.489> your<00:04:13.669> drain<00:04:13.849> plug

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
there we go there's your drain plug

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.379 
there we go there's your drain plug
11:16<00:04:15.799> fit<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.370> me<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.579> was<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.729> little<00:04:16.970> sloppy

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
11:16 fit for me it was a little sloppy

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.719 
11:16 fit for me it was a little sloppy
so<00:04:17.720> it's<00:04:17.870> probably<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.709> metric<00:04:19.190> but<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.370> couldn't

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
so it's probably a metric but I couldn't

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.759 
so it's probably a metric but I couldn't
find<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.750> right<00:04:20.780> size<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.200> eleven

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
find the right size and eleven

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.469 
find the right size and eleven
sixteenths<00:04:22.190> work<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.760> wasn't<00:04:23.000> really<00:04:23.210> tight

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
sixteenths work it wasn't really tight

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.680 
sixteenths work it wasn't really tight
but<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.560> anyway<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:25.030> get<00:04:26.030> your<00:04:26.180> drain<00:04:26.450> pan

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
but so anyway you get your drain pan

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.580 
but so anyway you get your drain pan
underneath<00:04:26.719> our

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
underneath our

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.490 
underneath our
broke<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.400> free<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.690> now<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.870> can<00:04:30.080> just

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
broke it free so that now I can just

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.960 
broke it free so that now I can just
reach<00:04:30.680> up<00:04:30.860> there<00:04:30.980> with<00:04:31.100> my<00:04:31.190> fingers<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.639> take

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
reach up there with my fingers and take

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.210 
reach up there with my fingers and take
it<00:04:32.150> off<00:04:33.940> okay<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.180> see<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.480> old<00:04:35.600> drain<00:04:35.990> II

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
it off okay and see the old drain II

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.260 
it off okay and see the old drain II
just<00:04:37.220> want<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.430> get<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.580> good<00:04:37.760> bird's-eye<00:04:38.240> view

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
just want to get a good bird's-eye view

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.590 
just want to get a good bird's-eye view
of<00:04:39.229> where<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> was<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:40.310> point<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:40.850> see<00:04:41.060> here

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
of where it was this point you see here

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.350 
of where it was this point you see here
is<00:04:41.750> actually<00:04:42.650> not<00:04:42.680> standard<00:04:43.580> that's<00:04:43.850> because

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
is actually not standard that's because

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.420 
is actually not standard that's because
of<00:04:44.510> my<00:04:44.660> plot<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.110> have<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.290> plow<00:04:45.560> package<00:04:46.190> and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
of my plot I have a plow package and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.840 
of my plot I have a plow package and
this<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:46.790> where<00:04:47.300> my<00:04:47.479> plow<00:04:47.870> connects<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.680> it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
this is where my plow connects to it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.490 
this is where my plow connects to it
just<00:04:49.850> two<00:04:50.240> pans<00:04:50.540> go<00:04:50.750> through<00:04:51.050> it's<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.290> very

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
just two pans go through it's a very

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.590 
just two pans go through it's a very
nice<00:04:51.710> little<00:04:51.949> system<00:04:52.430> it's<00:04:53.150> what<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.300> used<00:04:53.510> to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
nice little system it's what I used to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.040 
nice little system it's what I used to
snowplow<00:04:54.139> my<00:04:54.380> driveway<00:04:54.800> with
