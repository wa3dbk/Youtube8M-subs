that while it's pretty effective at
close<00:00:09.570> range<00:00:09.900> once<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.769> into<00:00:10.920> those<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
close range once you get into those you

not<00:00:13.769> quite<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.160> effective<00:00:14.400> usually<00:00:15.089> somebody

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
not quite as effective usually somebody

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.029 
not quite as effective usually somebody
with<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.599> A<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:15.809> an<00:00:15.990> SMG<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.470> gonna<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.800> able<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
with an A or an SMG is gonna be able to

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
with an A or an SMG is gonna be able to
kill<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:18.330> if<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.630> first

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
kill you first even if you have first

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
kill you first even if you have first
shot<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.619> delay<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.250> between

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
shot just because that delay in between

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.099 
shot just because that delay in between
each<00:00:20.910> shot<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> take<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.840> thing

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
each shot that you take with this thing

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
each shot that you take with this thing
so<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:22.890> rid<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> you'd<00:00:23.670> make<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so you get rid of that you'd make it a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.390 
so you get rid of that you'd make it a
lot<00:00:24.269> more<00:00:24.300> lethal<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.170> those<00:00:25.590> longer<00:00:25.980> shotgun

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
lot more lethal at those longer shotgun

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.419 
lot more lethal at those longer shotgun
ranges<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> hear<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> tac-19<00:00:28.429> shooting

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
ranges so I hear is the tac-19 shooting

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.679 
ranges so I hear is the tac-19 shooting
normal<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.939> guys<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.449> again

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
normal you guys can see that again

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
normal you guys can see that again
there's<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> delay<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.800> between<00:00:32.189> each

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
there's kind of a delay in between each

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.830 
there's kind of a delay in between each
burst<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> shoot<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.719> be

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
burst that you shoot so we're gonna be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
burst that you shoot so we're gonna be
getting<00:00:34.020> rid<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.250> shooting

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here you can see that it shoots so fast

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
here you can see that it shoots so fast
that<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> gun<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> sound

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that the gun doesn't even make the sound

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
that the gun doesn't even make the sound
or<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> shock<00:00:41.550> wave<00:00:41.790> half<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> time<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
or the shock wave half the time but it's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.240 
or the shock wave half the time but it's
actually<00:00:43.140> still<00:00:43.320> sending<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.710> damage<00:00:44.070> you'll

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
guys can see it's actually pretty good

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
guys can see it's actually pretty good
like<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> most<00:01:24.180> effective<00:01:24.689> thing

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
like it's not the most effective thing

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
like it's not the most effective thing
at<00:01:25.020> close<00:01:25.259> ranges<00:01:25.710> where<00:01:25.890> especially<00:01:26.280> when

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
at close ranges where especially when

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.770 
at close ranges where especially when
it's<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> one-shot<00:01:26.909> kill<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.540> better<00:01:27.720> off

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's a one-shot kill you're better off

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's a one-shot kill you're better off
just<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.290> making<00:01:28.500> sure<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.799> he's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
on the right stick and you're able to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
on the right stick and you're able to
aim<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> two<00:01:33.930> shot<00:01:34.229> three

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

shot 4 shot kill range this is

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.850 
shot 4 shot kill range this is
definitely<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:36.930> live<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.500> people<00:01:37.770> out

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860

definitely gonna live to take people out
quicker<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.520> yeah<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> pretty<00:01:39.630> cool<00:01:39.869> thing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
quicker so yeah it's a pretty cool thing

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
quicker so yeah it's a pretty cool thing
you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> know

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
you know it's kind of cool that you know

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
you know it's kind of cool that you know
if<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.850> skilled<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> practice<00:01:42.899> this

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
if you're skilled and you practice this

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600 
if you're skilled and you practice this
and<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> slight

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and get it down you can have a slight

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
and get it down you can have a slight
advantage<00:01:44.640> over<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.360> people<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> game

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
advantage over other people in the game

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
advantage over other people in the game
which<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.340> yeah<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.119> pretty<00:01:48.210> good

it's not necessarily you know crews here
insanely<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.759> power<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> does<00:01:51.360> increase

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
insanely over power but it does increase

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
insanely over power but it does increase
the<00:01:51.750> effectiveness<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.560> tac-19<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.130> little
