00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.840
 and there he would be like 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.600
 I knew we could do it 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.089
 like it clear 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.089
 Reuters me that he is right 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.399
 We're back and then we got into a tank 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.399
 raped except for some old victims arrived 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 Environmental issues like this time 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.360
 35 completely forgetting that's the golden mean try 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.420
 allow this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.300
 These investors will clearly look for them 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 Green is not enough Christine 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.780
 is 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.830
 and let's go 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.260
 not bad enough 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.640
 that was he just drove 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.780
 Enough talk Let's go where everyone is going on in the finish he is probably again 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.580
 see the magic mirror go 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.830
 Dr something back 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 if he's out to vote, why did you do that? 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.710
 Taxpayers are suspected of being the farmers themselves 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.740
 brought 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.960
 You know, seriously, that the nation is pretty 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 Difficulty brought but there it would not have to throw away immediately 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.750
 4 continue to demand 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.140
 I wanted to have him repaired in the city but there can be the weather 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.960
 quite simply i do not trust you i wake up games now but i wanted to 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.800
 It's enough to make him good enough 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.490
 the duty 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.800
 and with her, I'll talk later 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.370
 space 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.430
 I know the village can be traveling but I was happy with that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.079
 that may make his own RGZ a little easier 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.930
 and that happens with the mirror 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 if he is not in the wrong hands device is all right 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 Bern 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.290
 Therefore I am called in the sense of a single country 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 "Revolutionary 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.910
 I enjoy it unless it says 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.510
 gain 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.480
 they have a hero 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.160
 he will pull the vehicle out but let's see him fighting up like he did 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.339
 always do it 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.339
 and ultimately and that 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:37.759
 that has its reason 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.899
 historical 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.719
 I thought I could say that 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.429
 sure only imagination 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.060
 everyone on Ground Zero 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.439
 Oracle does not really talk about it anyway 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.489
 not the thing with the mirror upset me but you give that I had 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 At first, the FMA is far too dangerous 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.359
 s I had everything under control Euro lays however to the stars Wega 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.359
 Eifelkreis himself said Appel 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.399
 That's not true 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.789
 I knew it would happen 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.400
 yes but not to avoid 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 but in the meantime said to be overwhelmed 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.119
 daily learns that his text 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.749
 is that really important 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.439
 I'm the leader of the troupe 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.419
 if you have a problem with that leg has stuck 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.180
 to boot 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.080
 No, I have to deal with a four-string 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.039
 brought 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.489
 We are back and we are still talking much more expensive 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.230
 I will not have been because the Spanish version appears as 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.099
 last I am a waiver of the 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.289
 it always became everything 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.539
 for that belongs 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.729
 Small we act ours 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.059
 that can not be 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.059
 There are already Campbells to find out 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.509
 from there remains 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:57.699
 are 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.839
 until today he is moving networker 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.999
 That's the way it should be at home 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.329
 my eyes have to be painted i see a lot of women 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.179
 you did not tell her 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.729
 like on the 11th 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:17.370
 I forgot about the water sentence the school holidays I did not think 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.609
 that it really exists and that happens 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.280
 such a good one here I do not want only 1 1 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.960
 and the break through that we will help 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.559
 to be sweetened the evening 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:36.219
 Red Devils us succeed the street is Sal 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.960
 she should 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.050
 our grow 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.919
 Prove what's with you his sister may say everyone 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.319
 Impartial would have the operation of offspring ancestry 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.689
 what the hell wants serious announcements 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.199
 Put dollar therefore 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.930
 Morrow 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
 would be chairman percent 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.300
 I think he 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.509
 with which the 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.509
 he is not dead it is open j 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.300
 have close again 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.440
 In the beautiful moments, drinking water, it was vodka 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.389
 it seems to be the Martin market 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.389
 that's exactly what you can not drink 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.409
 the Hallenser 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:21.909
 certainly not really close 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.080
 what should I 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.969
 believe me weltwelt want why is our uncle was Taylor 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.779
 because both celebrate his glory days 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.800
 but he was 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.699
 they should watch 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.950
 they can not just leave alone 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.400
 is nothing new for him 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.909
 he creates the 3rd 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.270
 because neither is not one 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.530
 I should take the bottle that he blesses from under we must 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.699
 continue 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.139
 So the food goes 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.150
 I talked to her
