00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:11.570
 Yes is very much fall Yes This time, you will find a your report and will actually be friends Wanted Yes 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.830
 it's here 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.470
 Previous 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.369
 Finally Tosetsu rank'm finally is Yes I there is a character that s at the suppressed 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.270
 It was possible 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.630
 For example, it is water, but this is the one with the best assessment so far 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.439
 Early sense I am a genius student on the way 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 Very It should be noted that I was not a still s rank two Isao Kimu 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 There Toka also Do not unreasonable Toka s rank so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.070
 I had flounder but So the bullet 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.579
 s can not rank 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.800
 Yes 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.930
 8 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:52.820
 I wonder if that system Kyary milk is wearing now? How many ranks of TSE or more created in Aodo high school created 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:58.340
 It is much less I think I make in a suitably Well Cathedral to or clear like a array 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:02.510
 Well, for example, I'm this guy be that so is to try to do this I a can something that does not usually use 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 If you try to stuff something you like properly and try to load it with something you like 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.860
 is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 If you try to make a cat's first shot properly, you can also make a rank pitcher 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 Somehow or a Did you mean favorite deck as 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 Atoibe whether the previous the clouds as you like it is tied to events I thought it was not it good 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 result 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 If it went to this deck and it went without confirmation before and after, it was four after before and confirmed after 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.840
 Who was it I'd was good to reverse After 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.980
 Protect the I out with later 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 Not even sense 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.460
 Yes The strength of the school board is straight 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.250
 I have no grip 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:43.260
 Myself that finally I was a little surprised that I have what can pleasure 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.330
 Theme I like to say usually I will not really do much of the assessment but actually 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:51.780
 This well-liked and want to make create a usable player Well for example I the maintenance Sabupoji 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.400
 Put you up tremendously the Once your assessment or Tsuke Maru catcher beetle, Epilachna and although Well 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.510
 That's why I'm trying to make players who can actually play baseball 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 That's right 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.680
 This player 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.650
 I have not been hit at all since I went to Koshien, right? 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.119
 Basic I am until Koshien second round 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.520
 When is the Cathedral 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.060
 Firmly choose 3 play tiers for your pitching 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.550
 When better to go there went well in the sound experience points is delicious 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.310
 I went to Koshien by the time I went to Koshien . 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.490
 We are not almost advancing to 2 runners 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:35.460
 If you do it yourself, it will be beaten as it will be defeated by the final investigation. 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 It is a guy who is only the number of Chachakari chan, but it is still said that 9 runs and 2 runs complete 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.069
 I feel very much 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.969
 You can use it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.319
 I've registered in the middle of a piece, but I do not think that it will be s 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:50.269
 I registered 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:54.409
 Nde best rather than only have you Yes Well I kept in use in suppressing anything and ends up in the suppressed 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.659
 I have a sense of waste when I fight it , and I 'm making all 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.060
 It's a little question got to and down and bring to suppress the players of this Chutsuki ability 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.110
 Is it 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.880
 If you are a little familiar, please comment by all means spring 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 Rank in I So to until now there was no moderator from Tteyuu's and Shirane say this Kumaya 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 Though 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.340
 With this cat, this bear was once with a player of such ability 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 I know the feeling of the players that just soooo breaking ball to take Well 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:32.010
 This kind of control stamina It is hard to say whether it is distress and control rest well 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:37.050
 I think that the suffering is also well-0 breaking ball is Transfer to say a little clumsy Which is not struck 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 One of a pair Well Well kept I had'm correct announcement this by one of a pair I is messed struck 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.700
 The ERA No. shop, such as the Tteyuu I Sierra is do is keep quite the Tteyuu or bear with this 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.260
 right 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.220
 When I let a brush man do modern operation or child operation 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.610
 Players also made to learn and that in say a cat of such Kankomi 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:59.170
 If I make this my wife a day, I will always suppress it quite well 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.700
 Well, if you keep this guy down, you won't get hit at all anymore and you have a defense rate of 0 points 10 games 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.050
 About doing 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.670
 I say 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.860
 It is a report for the time being, as a really good player has been produced . I Look at the deck once more 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.110
 Let's feel like this 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.060
 Yes this is yeah 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:19.870
 I will review this later and put this picture on Twitter that I thought to make it a video this time 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.990
 Dm Since the reply was gotten terribly say Datte'm putting Why It's cod Takimoto 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.220
 Everyone but I wonder if you do not know the reply 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:31.650
 If you are a monster , there is a combo 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:37.410
 I am surprised at 8 I think that it is a combo equivalent to 7 minutes after 6 times Experience points also 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:42.000
 Because it can be obtained moderately and the physical strength maximum length hatch can be raised, it is equivalent to the physical strength maximum 18 rising 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.310
 I think it's good and say that it was unexpectedly good if I try to deck properly while using that combo 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.380
 You should do it later 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.500
 In the moving and to any 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.550
 Well if you say alle 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.150
 In one words, I wanted Sanada to teach me something beautiful, and I made it for that purpose. 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.440
 It is a feeling that I have organized that 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:07.650
 So when I make a starter pitcher, it's about Sanada 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.280
 There is also a combo with Subaru if you turn it into 8 rounds and this is attached with the fastball center Takemoto 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.170
 I know it 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.630
 It is a place where I wanted the day when it became the center of b b speed fastball center 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.930
 I'm thinking, but at 155 kilometers 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:24.740
 It was perfect because it was the center of the fastball with the latter fire 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:29.090
 Even with a change ball throw, there is also an old and very good paint knitting amount with the sharpness of the threat 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:34.729
 Well I think I want to make a video again 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.150
 Even with the vague video out everyday I do not retake the shot, but I still shoot out the video I took 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.280
 so 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:43.280
 In short, I did not carefully select only those that a good player was able to make into a video 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.729
 So hey hey sometimes like this 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.469
 In renewal investment 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.509
 I hope that players who have engaged in battle will be able to report back later if they do n't take videos 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:56.729
 am thinking 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:06:00.260
 Yes Well Well the combo and Well after all family Rimori dangerous When you release the summary of this deck 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:06.530
 Pounding and I ball speed also tell you the trick is 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:08.390
 Because I can build that individual strength, I put on cancer and muscle strength after pinch and rest and release tips 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:14.090
 Come on and raise the gunball speed 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:17.500
 It was super there and knee side and Abba to give me ne breaking ball pounding in reverse after the game experience points Heide 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.830
 I thought it was a very good job 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.390
 Yes Well 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.260
 I would like to wait at the place where I was there , I want it with s Lattice r 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.360
 It is a feeling 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.219
 Yes 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:36.840
 n By the way Well Well since that struck strength last straight to take that amount 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:42.330
 It was Well from a little to his wife because the starter type was also able to make if around the stamina and place 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:47.350
 I would like to try and make it, but it was a report that yes 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:51.520
