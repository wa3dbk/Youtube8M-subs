00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.150
 hello very good doctor we are in a 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.730
 new video and today I bring you the mod 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.070
 weaver bow is for version 1.7 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.900
 point 2 of minecraft and let's see it in 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 first place we have here all the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.619
 arches is worth all our things 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.580
 put these two left for last 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.470
 and well you have all the coffee growers in the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.220
 page in the description and if the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.350
 you want to see and I will teach step by 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.449
 step each arch you also have how to 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.489
 they do how they are captured and the different 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.190
 types of arrows because there are arrows 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:53.800
 explosive arrows in 8 etcetera good 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.980
 it is the first arch that is this 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.790
 this is the first arch that is the most 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.790
 bad of all but I 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.270
 that's not bad we 're going to throw it in there 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.240
 to 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 give tripper start to put the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.299
 bugs here to sack worth and let's 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.670
 do what this does 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.350
 die 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.790
 if you are going to see 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.479
 this this is pretty ugly physics 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.479
 pretty fast 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 there you are not bad this seems to me 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.759
 What is done with lapis lazuli? 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.010
 well it generates us a little more creepers 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.550
 ok in here is the dot box dragon 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.550
 for 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.430
 like the fired fireworks 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 that explode but burn 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.210
 if we have people do 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:11.200
 conclusion 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.200
 if it's made with a gold and a shotgun 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 eyes that are fair we have the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 where an area of ​​2 x 2 is not broken 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.990
 it seems if 2 x 2 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.510
 well it's a little weird it's done with 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.660
 gunpowder iron and then we have this one of 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.660
 here 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.230
 it allows us to point a lot of pop 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.230
 is 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.360
 then we have the options wait 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.510
 it seems another thing and this is done with 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 obsidian obviously some objects already 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 are the ones down on the display and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.130
 shoot one but it's going to take away no life 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.310
 I think it makes the slipstream of we there 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.200
 ok and two shots kills porters and takes 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.230
 very much in charge throwing him 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.170
 it takes 45 then if second takes care of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.520
 that 's the only problem that I see 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.290
 well we also have here two that are 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.450
 exactly like arch but this one does not 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.670
 does nothing simply does not stop 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.280
 shoot you see is not for this the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.680
 leander bow that it aims and marks you 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.450
 you see the arrows this one is saying where 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.450
 it's going to fall, well, you see, it's going 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.520
 and apart it zooms a lot and it 's 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.730
 saying where will you give 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.540
 - You see today it does not arrive 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.810
 there it is if it zooms a lot after 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.580
 another that is very beast this is the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.580
 what I like second I like it better 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.030
 it's a wonder 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.530
 good I have I have here I have taken both 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.750
 better degenerated a few pockets 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.230
 creepers and let's see what this does 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.660
 this is the rocket launcher and the rock is 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.030
 the one to be improved is worth in reference 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.120
 it will be I guess it's the damage you do not know what 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.010
 what does 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.660
 or not 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.290
 this is wonderful 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.290
 tomás 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.870
 and this one that is more or less the same but 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.440
 I guess it will take a little more than a year 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.440
 God 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.070
 this is wonderful 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.409
 and this is very hard look look look 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.250
 oh my cut 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.760
 and good guys until here that go 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.760
 arriving the review in this way all 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.930
 the coffee growers all the refills because 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.060
 each one uses a type of ammunition 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.280
 different you have it on the page in the 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.750
