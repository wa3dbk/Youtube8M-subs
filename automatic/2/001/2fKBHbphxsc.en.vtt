time that's not correct the correct time

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:13.470 
time that's not correct the correct time
sequence<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.940> sweet<00:01:02.909> where<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:06.040> then<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:13.210> be

I'm<00:01:56.069> my<00:01:57.069> wandering<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.469> few<00:01:59.709> minutes<00:02:00.099> the

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
I'm my wandering the few minutes the

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.240 
I'm my wandering the few minutes the
time<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.610> over<00:02:02.069> if<00:02:04.530> internal<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.860> will<00:02:06.069> be

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
time is over if internal it will be

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.690 
time is over if internal it will be
compensated<00:02:07.349> we'll<00:02:08.349> see<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.860> real<00:02:09.069> result

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
compensated we'll see the real result

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.979 
compensated we'll see the real result
but<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.390> now<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:12.190> never<00:02:12.400> will<00:02:12.549> win<00:02:13.030> it's<00:02:13.840> not

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
but for now we never will win it's not

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.839 
but for now we never will win it's not
possible<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.799> it's<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> glitch<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.670> system

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
possible so it's a glitch in the system

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.949 
possible so it's a glitch in the system
or<00:02:16.299> whatever<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.849> nice<00:02:19.150> I've<00:02:19.690> seen
