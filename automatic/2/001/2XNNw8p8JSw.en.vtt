the way we're going to be reforging for
the<00:00:41.940> most<00:00:42.120> part<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> personal

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is really important right now I do

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
is really important right now I do
recommend<00:00:58.289> using<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.800> add-on<00:00:58.980> called<00:00:59.280> reef

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
recommend using an add-on called reef

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
recommend using an add-on called reef
which<00:00:59.760> light<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.480> reforge<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
which light to get your reforge is just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
which light to get your reforge is just
right<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.280> most<00:01:02.460> part<00:01:02.670> you'll<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.969> able

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
right for the most part you'll be able

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
right for the most part you'll be able
to<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> best<00:01:03.570> possible<00:01:03.809> reforge<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to get the best possible reforge when it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
to get the best possible reforge when it
comes<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> dealing<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> hit<00:01:05.580> cap<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
comes to dealing with the hit cap and it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
comes to dealing with the hit cap and it
definitely<00:01:06.659> simplifies<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> process<00:01:07.500> now

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
definitely simplifies the process now

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.740 
definitely simplifies the process now
the<00:01:08.549> next<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:08.880> I'll<00:01:09.060> talk<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.600> our

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the next thing I'll talk about is our

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
the next thing I'll talk about is our
gems<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.770> previously<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.520> 5.2<00:01:12.060> almost

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gems so previously in 5.2 almost

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
gems so previously in 5.2 almost
everybody<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.140> jamming<00:01:13.470> resilience<00:01:14.010> but

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
everybody was jamming resilience but

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.789 
everybody was jamming resilience but
since<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> changes<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.570> patch<00:01:15.810> 5.3<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.650> made

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
since the changes in patch 5.3 have made

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
since the changes in patch 5.3 have made
the<00:01:16.950> base<00:01:17.070> resilience<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.909> sixty-five

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the base resilience now be sixty-five

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
the base resilience now be sixty-five
percent<00:01:18.540> most<00:01:19.350> people<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.710> gone<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
percent most people have gone back to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
percent most people have gone back to
jamming<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> dps<00:01:21.000> bat<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.960> does<00:01:22.110> seem<00:01:22.320> like

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
jamming a dps bat and it does seem like

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
jamming a dps bat and it does seem like
intellect<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.040> better<00:01:23.220> than<00:01:23.369> pvp<00:01:23.820> power<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
intellect is better than pvp power so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.210 
intellect is better than pvp power so
you'll<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.960> wanting<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> jump<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.830> int<00:01:26.040> in

this<00:02:07.049> prior<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> patch<00:02:07.649> 5.3<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.849> personally

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this prior to patch 5.3 and I personally

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
this prior to patch 5.3 and I personally
wasn't<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:09.989> taking<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> glyph<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.739> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
wasn't actually taking the glyph as I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.229 
wasn't actually taking the glyph as I
valued<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> glyphs<00:02:11.610> much<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.060> than<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
valued all the glyphs much more than I

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.460 
valued all the glyphs much more than I
did<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
did this one so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
did this one so
baseline<00:02:14.070> now<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.430> pretty<00:02:14.670> good<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.120> being

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
baseline now is pretty good and being

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.850 
baseline now is pretty good and being
able<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.780> cost<00:02:15.960> while<00:02:16.170> moving<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.590> always

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
able to cost while moving is always

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.680 
able to cost while moving is always
going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> be<00:02:17.100> very<00:02:17.340> beneficial<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
going to be very beneficial and the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.510 
going to be very beneficial and the
final<00:02:18.810> change<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.710> over<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.370> new

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
final change like to go over is the new

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.860 
final change like to go over is the new
glyph<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:20.880> gave<00:02:21.030> us<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.360> place<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
glyph they gave us in place of the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.020 
glyph they gave us in place of the
movable<00:02:22.140> while<00:02:22.440> costing<00:02:22.680> lift<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.310> actually

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
movable while costing lift is actually

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.400 
movable while costing lift is actually
glyph<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.330> lightning<00:02:24.660> shield<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
glyph of lightning shield and this is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.930 
glyph of lightning shield and this is
pretty<00:02:25.620> much<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.980> flat<00:02:26.250> ten<00:02:26.520> percent<00:02:26.850> damage

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
pretty much a flat ten percent damage

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.760 
pretty much a flat ten percent damage
reduction<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.050> something<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.470> feel<00:02:28.650> like

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
reduction this is something I feel like

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.440 
reduction this is something I feel like
elemental<00:02:29.280> shamans<00:02:29.670> definitely<00:02:30.090> really

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
elemental shamans definitely really

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.300 
elemental shamans definitely really
needed<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.530> combination<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.250> three

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
needed and the combination of all three

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.620 
needed and the combination of all three
of<00:02:32.550> these<00:02:32.700> buffs<00:02:32.970> definitely<00:02:33.510> make

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
of these buffs definitely make

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.110 
of these buffs definitely make
elementals<00:02:34.170> very<00:02:34.440> viable<00:02:34.710> once<00:02:35.100> again<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
elementals very viable once again so the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.610 
elementals very viable once again so the
changes<00:02:36.480> we've<00:02:36.630> received<00:02:36.990> definitely<00:02:37.470> mean

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
changes we've received definitely mean

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.930 
changes we've received definitely mean
that<00:02:37.800> our<00:02:37.920> offensive<00:02:38.340> pressure<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.730> much

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that our offensive pressure is much

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.940 
that our offensive pressure is much
greater<00:02:39.180> than<00:02:39.330> what<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.720> once<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
greater than what it once was in the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.650 
greater than what it once was in the
past<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.340> found<00:02:41.580> myself<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.120> positions<00:02:42.570> where

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
past I found myself in positions where

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.840 
past I found myself in positions where
if<00:02:42.990> my<00:02:43.140> dps<00:02:43.500> partner<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.040> being<00:02:44.220> shut<00:02:44.460> down<00:02:44.490> to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
if my dps partner was being shut down to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.760 
if my dps partner was being shut down to
effectively<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.600> wasn't<00:02:46.080> really<00:02:46.290> able<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.650> make

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
effectively I wasn't really able to make

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.080 
effectively I wasn't really able to make
up<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> effect<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> lot<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.850> damage

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
up for that effect with a lot of damage

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
up for that effect with a lot of damage
what<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:48.990> love<00:02:49.170> about<00:02:49.200> doing<00:02:49.680> twenty<00:02:49.980> five

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
what we love about doing twenty five

what we love about doing twenty five
percent<00:02:50.160> more<00:02:50.610> damage<00:02:50.940> as<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.240> as<00:02:51.360> the

percent more damage as well as the

overall changes to the way damage and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.830 
overall changes to the way damage and
resilience<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> moment<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.690> do

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
resilience is at the moment if you do

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.330 
resilience is at the moment if you do
find<00:02:54.959> yourself<00:02:55.140> getting<00:02:55.470> any<00:02:55.770> prox<00:02:56.100> while

dealing damage you'll easily be able to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.930 
dealing damage you'll easily be able to
drop<00:02:58.470> some<00:02:58.709> one<00:02:58.800> load<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:59.130> by<00:02:59.310> yourself<00:02:59.430> on

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
drop some one load just by yourself on

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.699 
drop some one load just by yourself on
top<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.020> ten<00:03:01.290> percent<00:03:01.560> damage

reduction<00:03:02.040> from<00:03:02.340> our<00:03:02.520> glyph<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.510> so

reduction from our glyph we're all so
much<00:03:03.810> better<00:03:04.110> at<00:03:04.230> surviving<00:03:04.380> damage

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
much better at surviving damage

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.130 
much better at surviving damage
personally<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.880> feel<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.120> offensively<00:03:06.870> we've

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
personally I feel that offensively we've

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.230 
personally I feel that offensively we've
benefited<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.709> most<00:03:07.740> from<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.250> patch<00:03:08.459> some

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
people definitely believe that elements

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.140 
people definitely believe that elements
was<00:03:10.740> one<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.070> best<00:03:11.280> specs<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> game<00:03:12.000> at

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
was one of the best specs in the game at

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.820 
was one of the best specs in the game at
the<00:03:12.209> moment<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.110> definitely<00:03:13.290> wouldn't<00:03:13.709> go

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the moment and I definitely wouldn't go

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
the moment and I definitely wouldn't go
as<00:03:13.950> far<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.370> disagree<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.480> it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
as far as to disagree of that because it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.360 
as far as to disagree of that because it
does<00:03:15.750> feel<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.170> elemental<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.830> very<00:03:17.100> strong

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
does feel like elemental is very strong

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.770 
does feel like elemental is very strong
at<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.610> moment<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:18.269> you're<00:03:18.420> able<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
at the moment if you're able to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.210 
at the moment if you're able to
effectively<00:03:19.200> multi<00:03:19.650> dealt<00:03:19.800> with<00:03:19.920> your<00:03:19.980> flame

effectively multi dealt with your flame

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.009 
effectively multi dealt with your flame
shock<00:03:20.489> you'll<00:03:21.180> definitely<00:03:21.570> see<00:03:21.600> yourself

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
shock you'll definitely see yourself

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.600 
shock you'll definitely see yourself
getting<00:03:22.140> loads<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.620> love<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.920> search<00:03:23.070> box<00:03:23.370> and

getting loads of love the search box and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.280 
getting loads of love the search box and
this<00:03:24.180> means<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.510> won't<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.870> worry<00:03:24.900> too

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
this means you won't have to worry too

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.750 
this means you won't have to worry too
much<00:03:25.320> about<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.769> increased<00:03:26.190> cost<00:03:26.370> time<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
much about the increased cost time to

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.580 
much about the increased cost time to
lava<00:03:26.910> burst<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.450> you're<00:03:27.959> able<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.290> constantly

an<00:03:30.420> incredible<00:03:30.870> amount<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.140> damage<00:03:31.470> you'll

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
an incredible amount of damage you'll

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.170 
an incredible amount of damage you'll
always<00:03:32.130> be<00:03:32.280> putting<00:03:32.670> pressure<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> enemy

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
team and you'll always be getting close

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.860 
team and you'll always be getting close
to<00:03:34.800> scoring<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.280> kill<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:36.180> once<00:03:36.360> again<00:03:36.510> going

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
to scoring a kill but once again going

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.479 
to scoring a kill but once again going

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
over that ten percent done reduction

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.710 
over that ten percent done reduction
we've<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:38.760> got<00:03:38.970> from<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> glyph<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
we've now got from the glyph I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.210 
we've now got from the glyph I
definitely<00:03:40.110> feel<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.739> does<00:03:40.890> make<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> huge

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
definitely feel like it does make a huge

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.550 
definitely feel like it does make a huge
difference<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.940> our<00:03:42.060> survivability<00:03:42.630> it's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
difference to our survivability it's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900 
difference to our survivability it's
always<00:03:43.739> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.980> help<00:03:44.190> survive<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.760> much

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
always going to help survive that much

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.340 
always going to help survive that much
longer<00:03:45.090> than<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.450> would<00:03:45.600> have<00:03:45.690> otherwise<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
longer than you would have otherwise and

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.140 
longer than you would have otherwise and
on<00:03:46.920> top<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.250> you're<00:03:47.580> able<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.910> use<00:03:48.120> it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
on top of that you're able to use it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.820 
on top of that you're able to use it
with<00:03:48.390> your<00:03:48.510> shamanistic<00:03:48.959> rage<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.650> even

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
with your shamanistic rage to have even

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.860 
with your shamanistic rage to have even
more<00:03:50.070> damage<00:03:50.400> reduction<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.420> basically

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
more damage reduction it is basically

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.660 
more damage reduction it is basically
now<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> mandatory<00:03:52.680> glyph<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.459> pretty

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
now a mandatory glyph and you're pretty

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.130 
now a mandatory glyph and you're pretty
much<00:03:53.850> always<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.540> be<00:03:54.570> running<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:54.989> it

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
much always going to be running with it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.259 
much always going to be running with it
I<00:03:55.320> personally<00:03:56.040> wouldn't<00:03:56.519> ever<00:03:56.790> want<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.120> drop

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
I personally wouldn't ever want to drop

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.670 
I personally wouldn't ever want to drop
the<00:03:57.450> tempers<00:03:57.750> at<00:03:57.840> lambs<00:03:58.049> reduction<00:03:58.530> for

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the tempers at lambs reduction for

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.320 
the tempers at lambs reduction for
another<00:03:58.860> glyph<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.549> I'll<00:03:59.670> most<00:03:59.880> likely<00:03:59.970> just

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
another glyph and I'll most likely just

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.910 
another glyph and I'll most likely just
be<00:04:00.480> swapping<00:04:00.720> between<00:04:00.900> little<00:04:01.470> ghost<00:04:01.680> wolf

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
be swapping between little ghost wolf

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.400 
be swapping between little ghost wolf
glow<00:04:02.100> hex<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.700> glyph<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.150> Captain<00:04:03.570> between<00:04:04.320> my

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
glow hex and glyph of Captain between my

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
glow hex and glyph of Captain between my
other<00:04:04.560> two<00:04:04.769> glyph<00:04:05.010> slots<00:04:05.250> there<00:04:06.060> are<00:04:06.239> of

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
other two glyph slots there are of

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.729 
other two glyph slots there are of
course<00:04:06.480> going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> few<00:04:07.380> other<00:04:07.500> choices

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
course going to be a few other choices

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.500 
course going to be a few other choices
but<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.489> me<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.640> think<00:04:08.940> these<00:04:09.060> are<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.420> be

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
but for me I think these are going to be

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.690 
but for me I think these are going to be
the<00:04:09.630> ones<00:04:09.660> I'll<00:04:10.019> stick<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.500> most<00:04:10.700> overall

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the ones I'll stick to the most overall

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.460 
the ones I'll stick to the most overall
most<00:04:12.060> people<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.480> agree<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.780> elemental<00:04:13.320> is

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
most people can agree that elemental is

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.530 
most people can agree that elemental is
really<00:04:13.739> strong<00:04:13.950> right<00:04:14.190> now<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.970> not<00:04:15.060> lacking

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
really strong right now it's not lacking

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.150 
really strong right now it's not lacking

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
strong it could probably also work with

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.360

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
recommend playing one of these two comps

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.769 
recommend playing one of these two comps
