00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:49.330

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.010 

it'll<00:00:50.000> take<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.210> little<00:00:50.360> bit<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.660> time<00:00:50.810> but

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
it'll take a little bit of time but

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.360 
it'll take a little bit of time but
eventually<00:00:51.320> you'll<00:00:51.650> get<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:51.830> ball<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.220> dough

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
eventually you'll get a ball of dough

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.400 
eventually you'll get a ball of dough
like<00:00:52.580> this<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.970> did<00:00:53.570> have<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.780> end<00:00:53.900> up<00:00:53.990> adding<00:00:54.320> in

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
like this I did have to end up adding in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.380 
like this I did have to end up adding in
some<00:00:54.590> more<00:00:54.710> water<00:00:54.980> though<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:55.910> smells<00:00:56.239> so

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
some more water though and it smells so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.110 
some more water though and it smells so
good<00:00:56.780> -<00:00:57.130> so<00:00:58.130> now<00:00:58.250> we're<00:00:58.400> dividing<00:00:58.820> our<00:00:58.940> dough

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
good - so now we're dividing our dough

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.180 
good - so now we're dividing our dough
in<00:00:59.270> half<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.780> I'm<00:01:00.530> rolling<00:01:00.680> half<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
in half and I'm rolling half of the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
in half and I'm rolling half of the
dough<00:01:01.370> into<00:01:01.580> a<00:01:01.670> thin<00:01:01.760> snake<00:01:06.670> now<00:01:07.670> shape<00:01:08.030> these

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
dough into a thin snake now shape these

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.780 
dough into a thin snake now shape these
snake<00:01:08.479> into<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.110> cross<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.130> ends<00:01:10.400> over<00:01:10.520> and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
snake into a you cross the ends over and

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.340 
snake into a you cross the ends over and
then<00:01:10.880> folded<00:01:11.330> them<00:01:11.510> down<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.080> make<00:01:12.200> our

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
then folded them down to make our

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.830 
then folded them down to make our
pretzel<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.520> isn't<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.910> real<00:01:14.150> pretzel<00:01:14.600> twist

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
pretzel this isn't a real pretzel twist

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.700 
pretzel this isn't a real pretzel twist
but<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.500> works<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:15.920> fine<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:16.190> this<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:18.229> you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
but it works just fine for this and you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.670 
but it works just fine for this and you
can<00:01:18.860> see<00:01:19.010> what<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.190> looks<00:01:19.340> like<00:01:20.410> now<00:01:21.410> we're

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
can see what it looks like now we're

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.469 
can see what it looks like now we're
going<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.070> make<00:01:22.280> our<00:01:22.520> glaze<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.119> pretzel

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
plain pretzels I'm just dumping out the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.950 
plain pretzels I'm just dumping out the
plain<00:02:08.080> pretzel<00:02:08.530> mix<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:12.570> I'm<00:02:13.570> adding<00:02:13.840> in

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
plain pretzel mix and I'm adding in

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.090 
plain pretzel mix and I'm adding in
three<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> half<00:02:14.410> teaspoons<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.920> water

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
three and a half teaspoons of water

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.490 
three and a half teaspoons of water
again<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.020> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> mix

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
again and then I'm just going to mix

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940 
again and then I'm just going to mix
this<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:21.210> after<00:02:22.210> mixing<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.200> realized<00:02:23.860> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
this in after mixing it I realized that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.560 
this in after mixing it I realized that
I<00:02:24.040> definitely<00:02:24.520> needed<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.850> add<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.150> more<00:02:25.360> water

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
I definitely needed to add in more water

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.480 
I definitely needed to add in more water
so<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> think<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.470> ended<00:02:26.620> up<00:02:26.710> adding<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.100> two<00:02:27.280> more

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
so I think I ended up adding in two more

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.060 
so I think I ended up adding in two more
teaspoons

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
teaspoons

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.200 
teaspoons
now<00:02:30.070> again<00:02:30.340> we're<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.820> roll<00:02:31.060> our

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
now again we're just going to roll our

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.480 
now again we're just going to roll our
pretzels<00:02:31.800> taking<00:02:32.800> half<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> dough<00:02:33.460> and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
pretzels taking half of the dough and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.490 
pretzels taking half of the dough and
then<00:02:33.760> rolling<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.150> into<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.390> thin<00:02:34.660> snake<00:02:37.500> then

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
then rolling it into a thin snake then

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
then rolling it into a thin snake then
we're<00:02:38.680> forming<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.400> shape<00:02:39.670> crossing

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
we're forming that you shape crossing

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.780 
we're forming that you shape crossing
the<00:02:40.510> ends<00:02:40.780> over<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:41.650> folding<00:02:42.010> them<00:02:42.160> down

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.400 

now<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.850> pressing<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.510> some<00:02:46.870> coarse<00:02:47.140> sea<00:02:47.380> salt

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
now I'm pressing on some coarse sea salt

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.270 
now I'm pressing on some coarse sea salt

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
big fan of this dip because it smelled

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.899 
big fan of this dip because it smelled
with<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> artificial<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.079> cheesy<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:31.909> to

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.530 

now<00:03:43.160> I'm<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.430> going<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.670> frost<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.180> cinnamon

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540

pretzels<00:03:45.010> with<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.160> frosting<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.760> made<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
pretzels with that frosting we made and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.410 
pretzels with that frosting we made and
you're<00:03:52.160> done<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.819> now<00:03:52.970> I'm<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.150> going<00:03:53.330> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
you're done so now I'm just going to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.630 
you're done so now I'm just going to
take<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.720> bite<00:03:53.990> of<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.530> plain<00:03:54.830> ones<00:03:55.040> I'm

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
take a bite of the plain ones I'm

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.220 
take a bite of the plain ones I'm
spreading<00:03:55.880> on<00:03:56.150> some<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.540> nacho<00:03:56.959> cheese

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
spreading on some of that nacho cheese

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.400 
spreading on some of that nacho cheese
dip<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.569> thought<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.840> plane<00:04:00.050> once<00:04:00.230> tasted

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
dip and I thought the plane once tasted

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.260 
dip and I thought the plane once tasted
okay<00:04:00.920> they're<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.430> bit<00:04:01.610> bland<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.239> I

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
okay they're a little bit bland but I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.030 
okay they're a little bit bland but I
guess<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.080> natural<00:04:03.170> cheese<00:04:03.530> dip<00:04:03.709> would<00:04:03.830> help

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
guess the natural cheese dip would help

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.729 
guess the natural cheese dip would help
if<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.310> like<00:04:04.520> nacho<00:04:04.850> cheese<00:04:05.319> I'm<00:04:06.319> taking<00:04:06.620> a

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
if you like nacho cheese I'm taking a

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.890 
if you like nacho cheese I'm taking a
bite<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:06.950> these<00:04:07.220> cinnamon<00:04:07.489> pretzels<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.270> I

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
bite of these cinnamon pretzels and I

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.449 
bite of these cinnamon pretzels and I
have<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.110> say<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.470> these<00:04:09.739> are<00:04:09.920> really<00:04:10.280> yummy
