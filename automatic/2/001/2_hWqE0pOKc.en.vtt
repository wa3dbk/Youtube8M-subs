00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
quite a bit of them it's quite an

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.810 
quite a bit of them it's quite an
investment<00:01:37.870> and<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:39.400> you<00:01:39.460> guys<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.790> don't

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
investment and for you guys that don't

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.370 
investment and for you guys that don't
know<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.150> stainless<00:01:40.570> steel<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.260> bit

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
know a stainless steel is a little bit

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.040 
know a stainless steel is a little bit
more<00:01:41.590> expensive<00:01:42.360> however<00:01:43.360> if<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.870> are<00:01:43.900> going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
more expensive however if you are going

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.340 
more expensive however if you are going
to<00:01:44.290> need<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.620> knife<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.840> rust<00:01:46.840> proof<00:01:47.110> or
