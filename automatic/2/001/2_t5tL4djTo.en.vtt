00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
here's another carrier just a random one

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.120 
here's another carrier just a random one
that<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.280> made<00:01:52.520> at<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.880> end<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.360> can<00:01:53.540> tell

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
that I made at the end as you can tell

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.610 
that I made at the end as you can tell
it's<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:57.040> acorn<00:01:58.750> then<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.840> comes<00:02:00.050> up<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.520> handle

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
it's a acorn then it comes up the handle

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.660 
it's a acorn then it comes up the handle
which<00:02:03.620> is<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:06.530> like<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.160> think<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:07.490> pretty

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
which is I I like it I think it's pretty

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.670 
which is I I like it I think it's pretty
it's<00:02:07.970> very<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.720> very<00:02:08.750> thin<00:02:09.320> wand

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.710 

exceptionally<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.920> broke<00:02:13.280> off<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.480> tip

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
exceptionally then I broke off the tip

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.260 
exceptionally then I broke off the tip
it<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:15.050> longer<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:16.160> was<00:02:16.280> actually<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> huge

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
it was longer it was actually a huge

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.040 
it was longer it was actually a huge
wand<00:02:18.489> but<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.580> broke<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.420> tip<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.840> probably

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
wand but it broke the tip of it probably

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.120 
wand but it broke the tip of it probably
a<00:02:21.730> good<00:02:22.730> thing<00:02:22.970> because<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.420> was<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.130> massive

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
a good thing because it was so massive

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.830 
a good thing because it was so massive
and<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:28.010> there<00:02:28.430> some<00:02:28.730> damage<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.510> it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and there was there some damage to it

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.560 
and there was there some damage to it
already<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.980> wood<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.730> got<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.209> devil

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
already the wood that I got the devil

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.810 
already the wood that I got the devil
had<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> whole<00:02:33.709> running<00:02:34.040> through<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.489> which<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
had a whole running through it which is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.289 
had a whole running through it which is
why<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.030> snapped<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.660> easily<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.260> i<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:38.120> it

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
why it snapped so easily but i like it

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.270 
why it snapped so easily but i like it
because<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.810> acorn<00:02:39.260> i<00:02:39.470> was<00:02:39.890> planning<00:02:40.250> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
because of the acorn i was planning to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.590 
because of the acorn i was planning to
do<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.610> anyway<00:02:40.790> because<00:02:40.880> when<00:02:41.239> i<00:02:41.269> went<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
do that anyway because when i went up to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.620 
do that anyway because when i went up to
a<00:02:42.400> Arrowhead<00:02:43.400> just<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:44.239> couple<00:02:44.660> days<00:02:44.780> ago<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.970> got

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630
