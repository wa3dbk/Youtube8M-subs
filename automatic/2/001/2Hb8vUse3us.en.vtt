00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
crack right along here that's pretty

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.559 

overall<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.730> think<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.909> motor<00:02:53.060> mount<00:02:53.269> kept<00:02:53.450> it

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
overall I think that motor mount kept it

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.780 
overall I think that motor mount kept it
together<00:02:53.659> yeah<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.680> was<00:02:54.769> definitely<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.310> RC

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
together yeah it was definitely the RC

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.589 
together yeah it was definitely the RC
custom<00:02:56.689> custom<00:02:57.260> RC<00:02:57.530> parts<00:02:58.090> motor<00:02:59.090> mount<00:02:59.390> that

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
custom custom RC parts motor mount that

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.149 
custom custom RC parts motor mount that
is<00:02:59.659> the<00:03:00.110> reason<00:03:00.260> we're<00:03:00.530> still<00:03:00.769> flying<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
is the reason we're still flying the

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.210 
is the reason we're still flying the
same<00:03:01.459> airplane<00:03:02.000> right<00:03:02.390> look<00:03:02.569> at<00:03:02.659> that<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
same airplane right look at that and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:15.140 
same airplane right look at that and
here<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:04.489> go

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.850 

bring<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.870> go<00:03:17.050> slow<00:03:17.320> bring<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.770> right

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
bring it you can go slow bring it right

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:33.220 
bring it you can go slow bring it right
over<00:03:17.920> my<00:03:18.190> head
