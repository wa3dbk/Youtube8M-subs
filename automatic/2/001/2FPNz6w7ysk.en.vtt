00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello youtube friends i am your brother and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.470
 have you ever wanted to be stars 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.760
 of pop have you ever wanted to be the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 new pablo alborÃ¡n 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.870
 the new melendi for you are in luck 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.480
 because to get it you only have 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.630
 that follow my 5 simple steps step 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.369
 number 1 compose the song for the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.859
 instrumental composition of the song 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.410
 It is very important to use chords very 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.420
 basic and simple with obstacles in yes I 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.820
 be the best topic will be for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.820
 example so the first thing that comes to mind 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.540
 do not 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.460
 na 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.050
 and now to give you a little bit more 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.880
 We are going to look for something with a charm 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.880
 lalala for example 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:58.860
 from air 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.860
 look at it the highest quality 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.310
 number 2 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.500
 write the lyrics a good pop song 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.600
 Must be gooey and little 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.150
 imaginative but with a small nuance 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.210
 have to have some small game of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.770
 somewhat confusing words to attract the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:25.270
 public for example 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.270
 the light of our love shines 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.530
 lost in another dimension and now we're going 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.299
 to look for another phrase that is confusing that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.640
 it does not make any sense but I can 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.640
 to play this time to the title of our 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.870
 song for example 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.370
 this 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.490
 and roads without return 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.220
 has a very reason we already have title 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 road without return step number three 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.010
 record and produce the theme this may 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 is the only step in which it is required 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.060
 a little bit of talent the production 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 musical 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.240
 we started by putting a bass 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 now a battery 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.180
 and record it and the lyrics were 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.720
 if you think 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.910
 I did not forget that all the songs 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.850
 pop are equal 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.120
 of our love lost in another 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 dimension 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.200
 and we have the finished song shines 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.510
 the light of our living north are number 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.920
 4 change of look 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.570
 we have to get a look that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.580
 attract teen females 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.880
 insecure we'll start with a shirt 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.880
 black 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.910
 a white shirt to below a 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.170
 good sunglasses really no longer no longer 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.000
 it takes that now it takes to be 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.800
 sensitive and following the steps of 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.690
 melendi or the outburst among others me 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 I will leave this on my head as a symbol 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.460
 characteristic and now I only have 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.150
 What to look for a name that creates a hook 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.239
 something like 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.310
 since jacko towers step number 5 the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.940
 video clip 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.550
 sorry 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.710
 the heat of your lips rubbing against me 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:28.580
 body my life 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:31.550
 I can not anymore I can more and I want your 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.890
 smile to my side when I wake up every 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:39.160
 day 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:45.150
 for you are my sun shines the light of 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 our love lost in another dimension 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.730
 It is a path of no return that clouds my 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.720
 reason 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.720
 and tears 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.570
 path 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:18.780
 on the way back to those who sing 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.780
 on the road
