00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
where the hell they're going which is

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.830 
where the hell they're going which is
the<00:03:58.080> majority<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.500> people<00:03:58.950> um<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.660> it's

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the majority of people um so it's

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.150 
the majority of people um so it's
ridiculous<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.530> takes<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.830> long<00:04:01.890> and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
ridiculous that it takes that long and

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.580 
ridiculous that it takes that long and
then<00:04:02.730> after<00:04:03.180> doing<00:04:03.390> all<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
then after doing all of that the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.320 
then after doing all of that the
instance<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.100> glitch<00:04:05.340> she'll<00:04:05.670> never<00:04:05.910> get<00:04:06.210> your

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
instance is glitch she'll never get your

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.900

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
reason to do the randoms at that level

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.070 
reason to do the randoms at that level
so<00:04:11.520> like<00:04:12.200> what's<00:04:13.200> up<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:14.210> why<00:04:15.210> why<00:04:15.900> an

so like what's up with that why why an

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.510 
so like what's up with that why why an
eight<00:04:16.320> million<00:04:16.560> patches<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.280> come<00:04:17.459> out
