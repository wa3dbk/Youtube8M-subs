00:05:46.180 --> 00:06:00.749 
you repeat the whole thing altogether
price<00:05:46.810> like<00:05:47.170> three<00:05:47.470> times<00:05:48.150> it

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.569 

yep<00:06:01.759> and<00:06:02.659> um<00:06:02.989> the<00:06:03.709> way<00:06:03.859> I<00:06:03.889> caught<00:06:04.189> you<00:06:04.369> in<00:06:04.399> the

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:04.579 
yep and um the way I caught you in the

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:08.959 
way John plays it I think he plays it

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.249 
way John plays it I think he plays it
like<00:06:09.579> that<00:06:10.579> and<00:06:10.969> then<00:06:11.629> he<00:06:11.689> hammers<00:06:11.989> on<00:06:12.109> with

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
like that and then he hammers on with

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.679 
like that and then he hammers on with
this<00:06:12.349> painting<00:06:12.739> but<00:06:13.459> that<00:06:13.699> did<00:06:14.119> you<00:06:14.269> crunch

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:16.609 
really fast I tried it like that it's

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:23.399 
really fast I tried it like that it's
not<00:06:16.849> fun<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:18.409> it's<00:06:19.039> harder<00:06:19.399> to<00:06:19.429> play<00:06:20.229> but<00:06:21.229> yeah

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409
