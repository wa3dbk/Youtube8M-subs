00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.700
 google dot com for you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 follow my blog 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 today I'm here with a new series that is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.120
 videos and I 'm here with my 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.309
 hairdresser cÃ©sar valle already accompanies me 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 One time he takes care of my hair today. 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 I decided to change and we walked 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.500
 researching found the hair 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.699
 perfect I'll call him to show 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 For you, here we are going to do it. 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 today how is a person her skin 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.310
 brunette 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.160
 we think of making a look that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.180
 tendency today is called balaiagem 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.050
 live that this is wicks seamless 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.700
 a more marked wick in the art of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 However, this goal is not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 hair movement you do not notice 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 marking does not cause me any 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 very beautiful light then first 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 It will be perfect this look 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.199
 sesa and we start want to know that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.410
 hair it gives to all skin types by 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.750
 a blonde who wants to make a brunette gives 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 for everyone to use this look he can 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.150
 use not everyone but it does not cause 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 brightness as large as the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.320
 lights that we usually do 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 to be blond platinum he is more 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 to give a light in the hair a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.740
 more discreet thing a nuance but 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 beautiful but not that luminosity 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 total that people use for the wicks 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.590
 even makes the goal gets super super clear 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 platinum 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.369
 So, how are you, the brunette? 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.710
 we chose the blonde can you can 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.890
 see that she does not want a result of 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.259
 extreme bleaching without problem 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 then that girl that she is brunette and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.860
 she does not think she does not stay 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.790
 pretty blonde this is a great option for 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.590
 can change the look 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 yes this is the best option for her 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.890
 start to lighten the hair and who knows 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.399
 more forward and get even fat 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.399
 Thank you, let's start 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.010
 a division above the rectangle format 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 split the sides 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.730
 from ear to ear 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.820
 super quick to do and if this technique 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.650
 and gives a fantastic effect of 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.440
 luminosity 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.180
 the tip is the following if the hair is me 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.150
 I'm doing e-mail hair . 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.460
 a bm does not have coloration so it goes 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.400
 to clear up super fast we do not have 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.770
 risk of having spots on this hair now 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.440
 it was colored hair 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.130
 There you have to take a series of 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.250
 because the part that has chemistry 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.380
 which has coloration apart to take longer 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.580
 to lighten 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.550
 So you already have to maybe not 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.830
 be the best technique for you to do there 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.820
 in your hall there we just do not know how you 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.170
 will do 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.900
 But then you're going to have problems, it's 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.720
 Then it will stain the hair. 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.630
 avoid doing if I have chemistry I've had 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.240
 a coloring can not work 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.570
 ideal 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.930
 I'm going to pick up in Canada and a half because of the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.930
 lower hair 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.640
 to prepare the product 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.709
 The interesting here that I'm going to prepare 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.230
 a very small amount 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.580
 Maybe I do it for 10 grams. 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.900
 here is a precision scale 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:45.459
 and we have more control than we did 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.459
 prepared here is 12 grams 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.580
 is that you 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.580
 wilson's solution works for 2 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.489
 the doors and dyes is a power 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.620
 absurd planning crossing 20 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.599
 volumes and will be why this super 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.359
 quick here because the clearly stated 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.629
 I want a very quiet team that nothing. 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:12.239
 a lot do not want very light hair 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.719
 want to give only light for doing so 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.900
 in order to create a movement in this 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.489
 compliance and accounts without 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.100
 to divert know that thing of staying 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.190
 dodging hair then releasing 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.280
 It's terrible is possible with this technique 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.190
 which is super cool and is not brand 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.599
 I'll show you how it works. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.130
 application that is more this is fundamental 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.949
 behave yourself, you will not have 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.949
 problems arise for me 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:01.520
 in april five just sunday be well 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.380
 done and who is here on tip 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.960
 overload a little more product 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.610
 that the effect is precisely that which is the 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.050
 top half is a low gradient 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.710
 of a 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.340
 but clearer in November of that year but 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:30.159
 the point is to harvest almost everyone not only 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:30.159
 do not touch hair and still skate air and 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:43.200
 it fell being a party luan caipira 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:52.890
 the mayor remembered music in the mirror 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:55.010
 Look, try and see the fantastic. 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.010
 job 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.590
 only this is the result of the work 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.570
 The most perfect country technique business gives 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.000
 a light lit in the hair 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.740
 this tinting it may be more snake 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.720
 she may be more gray I found that 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.610
 this fantastic result and I gave 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.620
 a very natural result 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.720
 summer is coming so he attacked 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.150
 life of mulberry beach that is 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:30.260
 incredible that will be good results there
