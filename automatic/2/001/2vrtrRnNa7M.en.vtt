00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
that pretty much might last three setups

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.490 
that pretty much might last three setups
were<00:03:04.040> shit<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.849> um<00:03:05.209> why<00:03:05.599> not<00:03:05.810> do<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.959> updated

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
version of it I mean it only makes sense

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.720 
version of it I mean it only makes sense
right<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.930> lot<00:03:09.169> has<00:03:09.379> changed<00:03:09.919> honestly<00:03:10.370> since

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.689 
what was it 500 subs and 11 Kasem's I
was<00:03:14.780> using<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.199> most<00:03:15.379> ridiculous<00:03:16.069> things<00:03:16.340> but

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
was using the most ridiculous things but

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.699 
was using the most ridiculous things but
at<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> same<00:03:17.299> time<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.750> mean<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.049> my<00:03:18.319> start

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and for some reason I always say this in

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.819 
and for some reason I always say this in
my<00:03:20.120> setup<00:03:20.419> videos<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:21.049> always<00:03:21.349> use<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.739> you
