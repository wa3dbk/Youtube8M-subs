00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.820
 for fun I completely boned 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.200
 an old desktop 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.550
 so that way it allows me to maybe 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.750
 recover components for 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 electronics with small motors 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 sales he 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.629
 I have a big cooling tower 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.350
 there I think I do I have a lot of 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.900
 coils I might have some 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.180
 components to recover that I wanted 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.699
 recover so that's the reader 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.840
 dvd cd burner and there is a laser 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.610
 in there I will try to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.690
 recover 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.220
 we see it here and then there is of course a 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.019
 hard drive but what I come 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.540
 to learn is that we could know 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.309
 that we could recover the hard drive 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 to make it an external hard drive for 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 another pc so I did not know at all 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.760
 how to do it and i'm going to show you in 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.310
 it's very simple just 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.530
 provide a hard disk adapter 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.900
 so I'm going to buy it big 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.180
 surface and this one he has the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.110
 particularity of being compatible in 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.660
 sata or ide systems 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.770
 so I do not know much about it but 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.720
 so the seller advised me to take 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 that one like that they would leave safe 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.540
 that he would walk regardless of the type 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.050
 of hard drive that we use then when 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.370
 we open the box is well in there is 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.460
 a case like that and like that then 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.060
 I originally I had spent her 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.670
 connections there originally it was his 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.409
 connections there that were connected so 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 it's all provided like that makes these 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.500
 plug and play that's all is provided 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 so I simply took off this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.540
 connectivity the quine that was not going 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.130
 with misunderstanding what I despise there are 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.069
 like that so I had this one removed 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.239
 who did not go I took that one 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.080
 who were hooked up there who were 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.830
 connected here 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.730
 that was wrong and instead I put 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.020
 this one and I put and I plugged in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:32.600
 this one is there then both taken the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.490
 fit well in my connections here I 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.770
 will show you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.480
 so this is the age well put it there this 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.860
 taken there I come the branch is there and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.130
 it is there enough to come the branch 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 is here 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:56.030
 then just enter the disc 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.070
 hard in the little drawer in this 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.120
 compartment 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:09.230
 after there are four screws not put a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.090
 here a the similar of here it is 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.380
 now the whole is screwed so that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.290
 holds the hard drive holds in his 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.240
 compartment 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:23.570
 you just have to enter 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:29.980
 then the drawer in its case 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.980
 protection to put the holes in front 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:40.100
 against the lid and the drawer of 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:42.560
 put liters or screwing phase and 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.770
 here you have an external hard drive 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.540
 ready to operate 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.070
 very simple because there since the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.660
 connectivity is already provided in in the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.600
 box 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:04.100
 everything is provided with since in the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:07.150
 box and provides the connectors a 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.150
 usb plug like that 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:23.250
 with the a classic usb socket and the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:28.910
 line with a small jack and a 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.910
 transformer is here a small switch 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.180
 in the box and even delivered a little 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.509
 plastic holder that allows you to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.160
 fix your hard drive case and 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.870
 so you can turn a disc 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.900
 hard old computer that you go 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.389
 to break in giant big key 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.449
 usb that you can plug into your 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.360
 current pc and that will serve you 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.550
 safeguard 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.020
 so we're going to watch that 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:07.099
 my usb key here i plug in my hard drive 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.099
 to the sector I'm going on the road 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.370
 my current computer recognizes everything 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.229
 right away so the very first 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.380
 connection he installed the device 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.449
 I had no way to do so 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.759
 after what I did well managed 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.470
 format my hard drive once I have 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.600
 reformat this external hard drive 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.240
 and then I can use it to store 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.250
 what I want in so that makes you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.500
 like a very big usb key 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.850
 so it's nice but I do not 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.600
 did not know I just learned it so 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.400
 that's why I 'm doing it to you 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.580
 share 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.580
 go ciao
