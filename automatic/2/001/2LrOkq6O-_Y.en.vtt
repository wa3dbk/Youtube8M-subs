00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
stock exhaust which is probably going to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.110 
stock exhaust which is probably going to
stay<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:12.950> way<00:02:13.310> because

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
stay that way because

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.380

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
chromed piece I think I think that since

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.280 
chromed piece I think I think that since
the<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> pipes<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:01.069> know<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.519> side

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the the pipes you know on this side

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.900 
the the pipes you know on this side
swoop<00:03:03.290> all<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.769> way<00:03:03.890> but<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.459> bring<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.790> lot

you've got you know chrome chrome chrome
chrome<00:03:15.410> chrome<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.739> then<00:03:15.799> you've<00:03:15.950> got<00:03:16.099> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
chrome chrome and then you've got the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.800 
chrome chrome and then you've got the
little<00:03:16.489> piece<00:03:16.640> right<00:03:16.849> here<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.090> think<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.569> think

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
little piece right here I think I think

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.410 
little piece right here I think I think
there<00:03:17.959> needs<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.230> be<00:03:18.319> another<00:03:19.269> compliment<00:03:20.269> of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
there needs to be another compliment of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.720 
there needs to be another compliment of
chrome<00:03:20.870> right<00:03:21.139> here<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.590> think<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.549> that

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
chrome right here I think that that

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.259 
chrome right here I think that that
needs<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.239> Chrome<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:26.239> yes<00:03:26.980> Tim<00:03:27.980> tag<00:03:28.269> it's

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
needs to be Chrome but yes Tim tag it's

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.210 
needs to be Chrome but yes Tim tag it's
got<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> 210<00:03:29.930> Metzler<00:03:30.440> on<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.739> back
