00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
or gravel onto one of these digits so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
or gravel onto one of these digits so
I'm<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.860> ahead<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.270> number

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
I'm gonna go ahead and go with number

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
I'm gonna go ahead and go with number
eight<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.119> ahead<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.329> drop

eight so I'm gonna go ahead and drop
some<00:01:30.659> sand<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.150> watch<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.540> digit

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
some sand in there and watch the digit

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
some sand in there and watch the digit
change<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.979> through<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
change it's gonna go through all the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
change it's gonna go through all the
numbers<00:01:35.549> until<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.299> goes<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> number<00:01:37.170> eight<00:01:37.400> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
numbers until it goes to number eight so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.450 
numbers until it goes to number eight so
here<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.939> number<00:01:39.180> zero<00:01:39.420> number<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.460> number

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
here we go number zero number one number

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.060 
here we go number zero number one number
two<00:01:41.850> number<00:01:42.180> three<00:01:43.140> number<00:01:43.710> four<00:01:44.390> number<00:01:45.390> five

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

two number three number four number five
Number<00:01:47.070> six<00:01:47.430> number<00:01:47.750> seven<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.229> number<00:01:49.740> eight

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
Number six number seven and number eight

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.109 
Number six number seven and number eight
boom<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:52.020> one<00:01:52.380> number<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.909> need

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
boom that's one number so then we need

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.530 
boom that's one number so then we need
to<00:01:54.210> choose<00:01:54.479> add<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.619> subtract<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.390> gonna

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to choose add or subtract so I'm gonna

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240 
to choose add or subtract so I'm gonna
go<00:01:57.659> ahead<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.680> gonna<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.070> with

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
go ahead and go with I'm gonna go with

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.230 
go ahead and go with I'm gonna go with
the<00:02:00.439> I'm<00:02:01.439> gonna<00:02:01.590> go<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.829> subtract<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.060> we

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the I'm gonna go with subtract so we

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.149 
the I'm gonna go with subtract so we
just<00:02:03.360> drop<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.840> sand<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.290> there

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
just drop some sand in there

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.190 
just drop some sand in there
like<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:07.049> thing<00:02:07.259> will<00:02:07.409> change<00:02:08.840> boom

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
like that and the thing will change boom

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
like that and the thing will change boom
subtract<00:02:11.190> alright<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.690> our

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
subtract alright so then we go to our

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.050 
subtract alright so then we go to our
next<00:02:13.200> number<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.860> I'm<00:02:14.640> gonna<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:14.910> ahead<00:02:14.970> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
next number and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.780 
next number and I'm gonna go ahead and
go<00:02:15.269> with<00:02:15.300> subtract<00:02:16.260> 8<00:02:16.470> minus<00:02:16.500> let's<00:02:17.220> say<00:02:17.459> night

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
go with subtract 8 minus let's say night

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.830 
go with subtract 8 minus let's say night
so<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.390> get<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> negative<00:02:18.690> number<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:21.450> pop

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
so we get a negative number so just pop

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.650 
so we get a negative number so just pop
that<00:02:22.110> right<00:02:22.319> there<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.180> watch<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> numbers

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
that right there and watch the numbers

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.240 
that right there and watch the numbers
change<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.140> might<00:02:25.290> take<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> while<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.099> did

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
change it might take a while like it did

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.890 
change it might take a while like it did
with<00:02:26.400> number<00:02:26.700> 8<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:27.060> asked<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.540> cycle

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
with number 8 because asked to cycle

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.809 
with number 8 because asked to cycle
through<00:02:28.080> all<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> other<00:02:28.830> numbers<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.640> 1

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
through all the other numbers like 1

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.430 
through all the other numbers like 1
through<00:02:30.060> 9<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.970> there<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.540> go<00:02:33.660> number<00:02:33.989> 3<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
through 9 so there you go number 3 and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.710 
through 9 so there you go number 3 and
as<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.489> see<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.269> can<00:02:36.300> already<00:02:36.569> start

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
as you can see you you can already start

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.289 
as you can see you you can already start
to<00:02:36.959> start<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.680> lag<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.030> map

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
to start to see the lag so this this map

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.509 
to start to see the lag so this this map
this<00:02:39.630> caused<00:02:40.230> some<00:02:40.380> lag<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
this caused some lag but it's like the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.570 
this caused some lag but it's like the
coolest<00:02:41.760> map<00:02:42.120> ever<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.010> honest<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.459> like

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
coolest map ever to be honest it's like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.750 
coolest map ever to be honest it's like
the<00:02:44.730> best<00:02:44.880> map<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.540> coolest<00:02:45.930> map<00:02:46.110> ever<00:02:46.319> and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the best map the coolest map ever and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.289 
the best map the coolest map ever and
boom<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.030> finally<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.540> your<00:02:48.870> your<00:02:49.380> number

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
boom you finally get your your number

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.860 
boom you finally get your your number
negative<00:02:51.299> 1<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:53.130> 8<00:02:53.400> minus<00:02:53.849> 9<00:02:54.030> equals<00:02:54.330> negative

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
negative 1 so 8 minus 9 equals negative

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.680 
negative 1 so 8 minus 9 equals negative
1<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> best<00:02:56.730> map<00:02:56.940> ever<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> as<00:02:57.599> you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
1 this is the best map ever and as you

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.410 
1 this is the best map ever and as you
can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.170> lag<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.730> intense

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
can see all the lag it's just intense

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.160 
can see all the lag it's just intense
this<00:03:00.840> map<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.110> like<00:03:01.410> super<00:03:02.010> intense<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:03.170> after

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
this map is like super intense and after

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.809 
this map is like super intense and after
that<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.530> got<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.769> reset<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> map<00:03:05.310> restart

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
that you got to reset the map restart

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.920 
that you got to reset the map restart
the<00:03:05.940> map<00:03:06.120> reset<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:07.579> redownload<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.930> so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the map reset it redownload it and so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.400 
the map reset it redownload it and so
you<00:03:10.019> can<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.260> another<00:03:10.700> calculation<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.569> but

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
you can do another calculation so but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.610 
you can do another calculation so but
it's<00:03:14.040> that's<00:03:14.489> like<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.500> the
