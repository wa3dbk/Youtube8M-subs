full effect of the redness that that I
got<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:54.690> I<00:01:54.950> probably<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.640> taking<00:01:56.970> these

really like this one it I actually

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.940 
really like this one it I actually
layered<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.820> on<00:02:46.970> top<00:02:47.240> right<00:02:47.510> here<00:02:48.020> with<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
layered it on top right here with the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.690 
layered it on top right here with the
blush<00:02:49.520> baby<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.810> love<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:52.160> pigmentation

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
blush baby and I love the pigmentation

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.920 
blush baby and I love the pigmentation
of<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.450> not<00:02:53.720> as<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:55.480> mean<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:56.840> a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
of this it's not as I mean it's a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.390 
of this it's not as I mean it's a
mineralized<00:02:57.440> blush<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.070> kind<00:02:58.280> of

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
mineralized blush so it's kind of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.670 
mineralized blush so it's kind of
shimmery<00:02:58.820> but<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.330> not<00:02:59.570> so<00:03:00.230> sure<00:03:00.500> Marie

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
shimmery but it's not so sure Marie

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.230 
shimmery but it's not so sure Marie
because<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:00.980> don't<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.340> shimmer<00:03:01.670> it's<00:03:01.970> kind

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
because I don't like shimmer it's kind

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.690 
because I don't like shimmer it's kind
of<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.690> sheen<00:03:03.100> type<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.250> effect<00:03:04.459> on

their blushes are very pigmented very

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.090 
their blushes are very pigmented very
very<00:03:15.800> nice<00:03:16.220> even<00:03:16.940> coverage<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:18.860> know<00:03:18.950> it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
very nice even coverage you know it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.850

stays<00:03:19.370> for<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> long<00:03:19.970> time<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.350> blends

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
stays for a long time and it just blends

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.440 
stays for a long time and it just blends
really<00:03:22.100> nice<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.610> smoothly<00:03:22.850> where<00:03:23.209> if<00:03:23.330> you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
really nice and smoothly where if you

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.060 
really nice and smoothly where if you
get<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.660> couple<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.080> can<00:03:24.380> like<00:03:24.500> mix<00:03:24.769> or<00:03:24.920> match

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
get a couple you can like mix or match

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.040 
get a couple you can like mix or match
so<00:03:25.730> that's<00:03:25.880> why<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.030> got<00:03:26.239> two<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.870> thought

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
so that's why I got two and I thought

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.750 
so that's why I got two and I thought
that<00:03:27.230> these<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.830> know<00:03:28.100> really<00:03:28.430> mix<00:03:28.640> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
that these would you know really mix and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.150 
that these would you know really mix and
match<00:03:28.910> really<00:03:29.150> well<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.110> really<00:03:30.620> recommend

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
match really well so I really recommend

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.949
