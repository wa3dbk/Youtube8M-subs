and<00:03:31.630> emotionally<00:03:32.350> one<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.100> most

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and emotionally one of the most

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.960 
and emotionally one of the most
satisfying<00:03:33.400> anime<00:03:34.090> endings<00:03:34.450> I'd<00:03:35.020> ever<00:03:35.230> seen

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
satisfying anime endings I'd ever seen

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.910 
satisfying anime endings I'd ever seen
and<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.030> gotta<00:03:37.240> say<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:38.140> show<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.440> extremely

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
and I gotta say this show is extremely

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.340 
and I gotta say this show is extremely
violent<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.510> little<00:03:40.510> violence<00:03:40.840> level<00:03:41.080> it's<00:03:41.230> up

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
violent a little violence level it's up

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.010 
violent a little violence level it's up
there<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.530> Gant's<00:03:42.010> low<00:03:42.760> against<00:03:43.209> was

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
there with Gant's low against was

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.990 
there with Gant's low against was
missing<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.130> little<00:03:45.370> touch<00:03:45.700> of

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
missing was that little touch of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000 
missing was that little touch of
innocence<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.200> think<00:03:47.380> makes<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.770> show

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
innocence then I think makes this show

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.090 
innocence then I think makes this show
one<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.060> finest<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:50.260> most<00:03:50.910> emotionally

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
one of the finest and most emotionally

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.820 
one of the finest and most emotionally
stealing<00:03:54.300> animes<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:56.260> ever<00:03:56.410> seen<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:56.800> my

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830
