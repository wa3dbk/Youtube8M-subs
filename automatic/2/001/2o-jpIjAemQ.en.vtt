 to the sony 3d hd mz introduced in 2011 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 the sony 3 of h &amp; m zeta 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 It is a 3d viewer on a subjective screen 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.090
 to visualize 2d and 3d on high 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.130
 definition with 5.1 surround sound 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.680
 virtual this viewer is perfect for 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 movies and games show an image 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.560
 vividly clear that will absorb you in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.180
 a truly personal experience 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.990

 virtual 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.930
 the new one allows the player to look 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.360
