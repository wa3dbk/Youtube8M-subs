that just cuter look
and<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.959> would<00:02:10.140> definitely<00:02:10.349> wear<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.540> tank

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I would definitely wear a tank

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.710 
and I would definitely wear a tank
underneath<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.319> too<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.360> little<00:02:15.599> bit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
underneath just too it's a little bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720 
underneath just too it's a little bit
shorter<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.439> just<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.829> add<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.159> bit<00:02:17.459> more

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
shorter so just to add a little bit more

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420 
shorter so just to add a little bit more
length<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.079> looks<00:02:19.290> much<00:02:19.860> better<00:02:20.129> that

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
length I think it looks much better that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.759 
length I think it looks much better that
way<00:02:22.579> okay<00:02:23.579> so<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.939> is<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.269> other<00:02:24.590> shirt<00:02:25.590> that

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
way okay so this is the other shirt that

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.880 
way okay so this is the other shirt that
i<00:02:25.829> got<00:02:26.010> from<00:02:26.250> pacsun<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.269> it's<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.620> same

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
i got from pacsun and it's just the same

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.199 
i got from pacsun and it's just the same
type<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> style<00:02:29.579> it's<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.180> white<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.189> I

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
type of style it's just white and I

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.819 
type of style it's just white and I
definitely<00:02:33.209> wear<00:02:33.720> tank<00:02:33.989> top<00:02:34.230> underneath<00:02:34.620> this

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
definitely wear tank top underneath this

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.610 
definitely wear tank top underneath this
because<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.150> previous<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
because like the previous one it's a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.190 
because like the previous one it's a
little<00:02:37.739> bit<00:02:37.920> shorter<00:02:38.659> but<00:02:39.659> with<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.140> you
