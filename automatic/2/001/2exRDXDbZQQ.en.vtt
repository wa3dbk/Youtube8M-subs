 normal size medium size and a cup 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.280
 it says it's a cup of oil from the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.400
 that I put three quarters 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.470
 transformers cup of vegetable oil 50 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.170
 of melted butter and a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060
 teaspoon of powder to order the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.590
 famous royal ok all this in one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.000
 blender we beat it until they are 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 all the ingredients well we put it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.020
 baked and now teach what is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.020
 Bake how to do the bathroom challenge 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.500
 good is this already 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.769
 Explain 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.769
 the bitumen we are four cups 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 polarized sugar we need 2 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.900
 tablespoons of milk 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.299
 two teaspoons vanilla extract 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
 of natural vanilla if they want to 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.349
 paint the mind a little bit of the bitumen 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.270
 but if they want they can get 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:43.500
 our 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:46.620
 and we were going to need two bars 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.350
 two bars of 90 grams of butter and 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.750
 the only thing that is butter 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.120
 obviously I have it outside from 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.460
 It's been a while since I've been 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.780
 room temperature even at the point 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.240
 to the heater because I was just cold 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.100
 lately but it is already if they are fixed 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.110
 completely manageable 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.550
 because if we are not much rather complicated 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.380
 it leaves us always outside if it is in a 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.500
 Where it is very cold to put 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.800
 to make heat can not make heater 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 a radiator and this so that it is well 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.050
 of vido 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.050
 A) Yes 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.160
 let's beat 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.470
 in this case 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.030
 i 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.740
 the speed of the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.330
 pay because if we are not going to go 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.880
 raising the speed until it is already 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.110
 at the most to our blender so that 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.090
 the butter is perfectly for 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.360
 you nobody we incorporated already in the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.360
 place 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.930
 you have roberto nothing more 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.540
 this already when the cake comes out we're going 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.520
 let's get in a little bit let's go with 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.550
 a spatula we will go stretching 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.560
 so that it is perfectly covered 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.460
 our bitumen we put our cake 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.460
 and we put decoration 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.330
 our cake is already out of the oven 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.979
 nothing else 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.979
 incredible purpose then with him 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.470
 and as we are already accepting 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:21.530
 eleven of these we did a little bit of 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.310
 white colorant vegetable coloring for 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.610
 that he did not lose he did not lose the target that 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.610
 we could 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.060
 instead of a good our cake 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.159
 okay 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.229
 the important thing is to let your cake cool 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.729
 it's not made with butter and then 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.270
 if they do not let cool 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.270
 they are going 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.230
 good 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.969
 and it is already 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.520
 the eleven nothing more we match the bitumen 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.420
 and ready 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.990
 we have the options here we can 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.990
 grab covers 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.740
 let's refound and make figurines or 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.760
 we can cheat 4th form the 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.300
 figurines 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.990
 I already have lists 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.520

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.520

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.240

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.160
 we go 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.530
 it's an orange cake with figures 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.970

 I'm recovering my kitchen because I ask 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.470
 a cook to invade us to make bread 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.150
 but they tell me they're going to have to 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.100
