00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
this is the easiest and best way to get

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.590 
this is the easiest and best way to get
peers<00:00:07.000> to<00:00:07.330> games<00:00:07.750> to<00:00:08.139> run<00:00:08.380> on<00:00:08.650> your<00:00:08.860> PC<00:00:09.600> the

called<00:00:37.380> BIOS<00:00:38.380> I<00:00:38.680> believe<00:00:39.130> it's<00:00:39.280> called<00:00:39.460> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
called BIOS I believe it's called and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.410 
called BIOS I believe it's called and
simply<00:00:42.340> with<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.730> you're<00:00:42.969> just<00:00:43.120> going<00:00:43.329> to

directory simple as that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.540 
directory simple as that
now<00:00:59.079> after<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.530> have<00:00:59.770> done<00:00:59.890> that<00:00:59.950> you're<00:01:00.340> just

going to want to launch the application

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.700 
going to want to launch the application
I<00:01:02.590> probably<00:01:03.370> suggest<00:01:04.320> running<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.590> as

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
I probably suggest running it as

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.800 
I probably suggest running it as
administrator<00:01:05.950> just<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.119> prevent<00:01:07.450> any

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
administrator just to prevent any

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.699 
administrator just to prevent any
problems<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:08.799> might<00:01:08.950> happen<00:01:10.380> once<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.619> have

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:11.709 
problems that might happen once you have

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.559 
problems that might happen once you have
done<00:01:11.859> that<00:01:11.889> it<00:01:12.279> should<00:01:12.549> prompt<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.240> like

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:13.569 
done that it should prompt you with like

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.599 
done that it should prompt you with like
some<00:01:13.929> new<00:01:14.200> start<00:01:14.619> thing<00:01:14.950> but<00:01:15.279> because<00:01:15.490> I've

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
some new start thing but because I've

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.609 
some new start thing but because I've
already<00:01:15.850> run<00:01:15.999> that<00:01:16.179> I<00:01:16.209> don't<00:01:16.479> have<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:16.810> so

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
already run that I don't have this so

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.109 
already run that I don't have this so
you<00:01:17.679> should<00:01:18.069> go<00:01:18.159> for<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.399> startup<00:01:18.759> have<00:01:18.969> it

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
you should go for that startup have it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.129 
tricky to find out how to download this
but<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.239> just<00:02:44.359> have<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.540> scroll<00:02:44.840> down<00:02:44.870> until

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
but you just have to scroll down until

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.539 
but you just have to scroll down until
you<00:02:45.440> find<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.920> download<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.989> there<00:02:48.549> after

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
you find that download it's there after

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it will be within the raw file so we

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.160 
it will be within the raw file so we
need<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.799> do<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.220> extract<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.209> file

that all you have to do is open that in

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.559 
that all you have to do is open that in
this<00:03:10.579> application<00:03:12.099> it's<00:03:13.099> under<00:03:13.370> C<00:03:13.579> DVD<00:03:14.090> just

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
this application it's under C DVD just

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.229 
this application it's under C DVD just
do<00:03:14.780> ISO<00:03:15.500> selector<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:16.160> then<00:03:16.310> browse<00:03:16.549> for<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.940> I

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
do ISO selector and then browse for it I

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.890 
do ISO selector and then browse for it I
have<00:03:18.079> noticed<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.829> says<00:03:18.980> no<00:03:19.250> disc<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:20.450> I'm

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
have noticed that it says no disc so I'm

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.470 
have noticed that it says no disc so I'm
not<00:03:21.049> sure<00:03:21.200> if<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.739> put<00:03:22.099> old<00:03:22.280> ps2<00:03:22.849> discs<00:03:23.299> in

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
not sure if you can put old ps2 discs in

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.930 
not sure if you can put old ps2 discs in
there<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.049> then<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.560> will<00:03:24.650> just<00:03:24.799> launch<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.370> no

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
there and then it will just launch it no

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.199 
there and then it will just launch it no
problems<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:28.340> method<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.120> don't

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
problems but this method you don't

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.970 
problems but this method you don't
actually<00:03:29.419> need<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> discs<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.709> don't

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
actually need the discs so you don't

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.250 
actually need the discs so you don't
even<00:03:31.099> need<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.340> ps2<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.870> can<00:03:33.019> do<00:03:33.139> this

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
even need a ps2 and you can do this

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.830 
even need a ps2 and you can do this
method<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.919> as<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.639> can<00:03:34.760> see<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:35.269> opens<00:03:35.419> like

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
method and as you can see it opens like

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.650 
method and as you can see it opens like
this<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.410> can<00:03:36.650> change<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:37.459> configs<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.510> get

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
this you can change like configs to get

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.839 
this you can change like configs to get
like<00:03:38.840> better<00:03:39.109> frame<00:03:39.470> rate<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:39.950> resolution

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
like better frame rate and resolution

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.330 
like better frame rate and resolution
and<00:03:41.000> shader<00:03:41.329> stuff<00:03:41.720> but

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and shader stuff but

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.180 
and shader stuff but
you<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.910> see<00:03:44.150> here<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:44.720> recording<00:03:45.650> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.740 

opening<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.310> application<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.480> still

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
opening this application and I still

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.600 
opening this application and I still
have<00:03:50.900> like<00:03:51.080> a<00:03:51.110> steady<00:03:51.410> 50<00:03:51.800> frames<00:03:51.950> per<00:03:52.190> second

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
have like a steady 50 frames per second

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.100 
have like a steady 50 frames per second
so<00:03:53.030> there<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.330> no<00:03:53.480> problem<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:53.989> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
so there is no problem with the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.170 
so there is no problem with the
framerate<00:03:54.349> I'm<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.700> going<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.849> leave<00:03:56.000> this

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
framerate I'm just going to leave this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.650 
framerate I'm just going to leave this
