00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.330
 the good end 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.330
 the priest is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.260
 hi guys okay 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.670
 today I'll know who to interview 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 shift is cool is not the x glide account 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.370
 for us here a little bit of yours 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.340
 beginning 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.600
 It is true that you were the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.580
 graphite 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.770
 Yes I started with a tattoo in 1996 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.900
 at that time was well made everything is a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.280
 money with art so I have one 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.800
 proximity to some skaters 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 tattooists who encouraged me to 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.010
 start this new artistic journey 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.829
 tattoo it 's true you see it already 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.950
 has performed live on band shows such as 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.770
 what is it about graphing with music the 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.050
 music gives the rhythm of the paintings, then 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.000
 in a show is very special because the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 music is happening there at the time 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.009
 public are enjoying you are involved 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.950
 I started there the energy is very cool 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.080
 because it already has small bands like that with 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.180
 Want audience and big bands 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.090
 including the lowest of thousands of 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.920
 people and what colors are preferred 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.310
 in your art 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 those that you like to use whenever I 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.130
 use very purple lilac pink and gray 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.630
 I really like painting with these 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 things because they combine very well. 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.190
 among them but one has to the world 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.179
 men think that these are colors of 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.039
 girls 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.110
 I disagree that I think things are 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.670
 very pretty and use them constantly 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.810
 in my work 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.690
 It's okay, thank you. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.849
 interview and tivit was very cool I 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.270

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:06.459

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.849

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.310

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.500
 I'm so damn these cats there that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.250
 You paint, you know how you can 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.849
 to draw them so smaller line with face 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 the good guy a cat die of 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.960
 fear 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
 my soul my wife 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.490

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.260
 We are always together painting for 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.450
