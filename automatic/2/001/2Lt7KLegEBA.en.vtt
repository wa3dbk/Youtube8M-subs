00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
because like different games two

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.540 
because like different games two
different<00:01:53.270> score<00:01:53.510> limits<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:56.150> around<00:01:56.510> here

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
using a newbie kill treat gun even this

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.850 
using a newbie kill treat gun even this
really<00:02:09.800> isn't<00:02:09.979> i<00:02:10.250> heard<00:02:11.090> someone<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:12.590> isn't

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
really isn't i heard someone this isn't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.080 
really isn't i heard someone this isn't
the<00:02:12.920> bit<00:02:13.069> while<00:02:13.280> we<00:02:13.310> got<00:02:13.580> round<00:02:13.730> beyond<00:02:13.940> me

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the bit while we got round beyond me

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.760 
the bit while we got round beyond me
this<00:02:14.510> isn't<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> best<00:02:15.020> gun<00:02:15.260> i<00:02:15.290> could<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.560> using

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
this isn't the best gun i could be using

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.560 
this isn't the best gun i could be using
i<00:02:15.980> think<00:02:16.160> an<00:02:16.220> SMG<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.760> more<00:02:17.000> suited<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.420> this

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
i think an SMG is more suited for this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.500 
i think an SMG is more suited for this
map<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.250> it's<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.880> i'm<00:02:19.970> using<00:02:20.239> like<00:02:20.360> oh

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
map so it's not like i'm using like oh

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.930 
map so it's not like i'm using like oh
my<00:02:20.660> god<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> best<00:02:21.080> gun
