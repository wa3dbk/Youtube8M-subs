to<00:03:30.780> say<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.020> least<00:03:34.820> it's<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> bigger

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
to say the least it's one of the bigger

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.720 
to say the least it's one of the bigger
ones<00:03:38.120> cooler<00:03:39.120> up<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.950> course<00:03:41.190> also<00:03:41.430> just

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
ones cooler up here of course also just

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.130 
ones cooler up here of course also just
use<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:42.000> storage<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:45.300> then<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.110> is

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
use your storage and then this one is

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.720 
use your storage and then this one is
actually<00:03:46.350> bigger<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.010> deeper<00:03:47.100> than<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.430> looks

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
actually bigger and deeper than it looks
