00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.330 
first place without suggest you know
flying<00:00:36.470> away<00:00:36.590> if<00:00:36.770> you're<00:00:36.860> out<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.160> open

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
flying away if you're out in the open

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.280 
flying away if you're out in the open
just<00:00:37.670> keep<00:00:37.850> going<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:38.210> straight<00:00:38.510> path<00:00:38.720> and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
just keep going to straight path and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.990 
just keep going to straight path and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
trying to shoot you and the reason why

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.890 
trying to shoot you and the reason why
you're<00:00:43.820> going<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:43.970> do<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
you're going to do this is because the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.630 
you're going to do this is because the
missiles<00:00:45.350> typically<00:00:45.800> have<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.950> range<00:00:46.220> i<00:00:46.460> think

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
missiles typically have a range i think

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.360 
missiles typically have a range i think
it's<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:46.879> 300<00:00:47.210> meters<00:00:47.750> or<00:00:47.900> so<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.190> here's

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
it's like 300 meters or so and so here's

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.280 
it's like 300 meters or so and so here's
someone<00:00:49.580> fly<00:00:49.910> as<00:00:50.090> far<00:00:50.330> away<00:00:50.510> as<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:50.870> and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
someone fly as far away as you can and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.170 
someone fly as far away as you can and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
jumping into the the side seat stay in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.619 
jumping into the the side seat stay in

repairing the helicopter when they ended

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.900 
repairing the helicopter when they ended
up<00:03:22.239> jumping<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.890> getting<00:03:23.890> shot<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.819> know

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
up jumping in getting shot and you know

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.449 
up jumping in getting shot and you know
i<00:03:24.940> was<00:03:25.150> still<00:03:25.390> repairing<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.230> i<00:03:26.889> ended<00:03:27.340> up

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
i was still repairing and i ended up

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.460 
i was still repairing and i ended up
repair<00:03:27.790> enough<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.450> i<00:03:28.510> was<00:03:28.660> able<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.900> fly<00:03:29.200> away
