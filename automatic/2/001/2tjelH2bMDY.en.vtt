00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.680 
I thought it would be and some parts is
actually<00:01:55.760> better<00:01:55.940> than<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.270> guy<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.540> can

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
actually better than this guy you can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.380 
actually better than this guy you can
see<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:56.930> gun<00:01:57.200> gun<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.549> guy<00:01:58.790> has<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.000> couple

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
see this gun gun this guy has a couple

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.120 
see this gun gun this guy has a couple
of<00:01:59.479> paints<00:01:59.780> over<00:01:59.960> here<00:02:00.260> on<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.500> side<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.830> guess

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
of paints over here on the side I guess

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.560 
of paints over here on the side I guess
so<00:02:01.250> does<00:02:01.369> this<00:02:01.460> one<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:01.909> aren't<00:02:02.390> as

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
so does this one but this one aren't as

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.630 
so does this one but this one aren't as
bad<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:03.979> terms<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.280> painting<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.580> think

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
bad and in terms of painting I think

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.430 
bad and in terms of painting I think
this<00:02:04.850> guy<00:02:04.970> has<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.150> way<00:02:05.450> more<00:02:05.810> shading<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.409> the

this guy has a way more shading and the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.160 
this guy has a way more shading and the
much<00:02:06.680> darker<00:02:07.159> blues<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.580> all<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.820> guy

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
cool-looking

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.119 
cool-looking
I<00:03:23.180> think<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.049> snapshot<00:03:24.560> spider-man<00:03:25.010> was

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
I think the snapshot spider-man was

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.449 
I think the snapshot spider-man was
based<00:03:25.370> more<00:03:25.579> for<00:03:25.819> for<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:27.159> what's<00:03:28.159> his<00:03:28.250> name

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
based more for for the what's his name

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.330 
based more for for the what's his name
John<00:03:28.730> Romita<00:03:29.109> like<00:03:30.109> senior<00:03:30.620> yeah<00:03:30.980> that's<00:03:31.219> I

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
John Romita like senior yeah that's I

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.009 
John Romita like senior yeah that's I
won't<00:03:31.459> correct<00:03:31.700> yeah<00:03:31.939> senior<00:03:32.329> because<00:03:32.659> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
won't correct yeah senior because the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.229 
won't correct yeah senior because the
head<00:03:33.169> sculpt<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.829> just<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.790> only<00:03:34.969> time<00:03:35.120> was

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
head sculpt and just the only time was

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.330 
head sculpt and just the only time was
different<00:03:35.450> was<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.290> build<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.010> coloring

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
different was the build and the coloring

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.860 
different was the build and the coloring
and<00:03:37.579> everything<00:03:37.639> was<00:03:37.969> accurate<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.419> what<00:03:38.689> -

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
and everything was accurate to what -

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.449 
and everything was accurate to what -
like<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.290> spider<00:03:39.560> logos<00:03:39.859> in<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.010> back<00:03:40.250> which

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
like the spider logos in the back which

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.030 
like the spider logos in the back which
aren't<00:03:40.639> as<00:03:40.760> traditional<00:03:41.299> as<00:03:41.389> his<00:03:41.569> artwork<00:03:42.040> but

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
aren't as traditional as his artwork but

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.369 
aren't as traditional as his artwork but
I<00:03:43.069> think<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.310> still<00:03:43.669> looks<00:03:43.819> pretty<00:03:43.909> cool

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
I think it still looks pretty cool

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.689 
I think it still looks pretty cool
fingers<00:03:45.379> we<00:03:45.530> got<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> bunch<00:03:45.889> of<00:03:46.010> black<00:03:46.340> shading

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
fingers we got a bunch of black shading

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.250

has a triple join a torpid joint which

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.480 
has a triple join a torpid joint which
is<00:04:29.780> kind<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.110> unique<00:04:30.259> it<00:04:30.650> has<00:04:30.770> in<00:04:31.009> and<00:04:31.190> out<00:04:31.280> as

right<00:04:36.740> here<00:04:36.919> which<00:04:37.039> kind<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.280> pops<00:04:37.520> side<00:04:37.759> we

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
right here which kind of pops side we

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.430 
right here which kind of pops side we
can<00:04:38.090> see<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.389> workings<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.080> figure<00:04:39.349> on

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
can see the workings of the figure on

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.040 
can see the workings of the figure on
the<00:04:39.500> inside<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:40.009> see<00:04:40.039> how<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.340> hinge<00:04:40.580> works

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
the inside you see how the hinge works

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.240 
the inside you see how the hinge works
but<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.139> doesn't<00:04:42.380> really<00:04:42.470> cause<00:04:42.680> an<00:04:42.830> issue<00:04:42.949> so

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
but it doesn't really cause an issue so

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.129 
but it doesn't really cause an issue so
the<00:04:43.370> cool<00:04:43.610> has<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> hinge<00:04:44.509> over<00:04:44.720> here<00:04:44.840> as<00:04:44.930> well

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
the cool has the hinge over here as well

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.510 
the cool has the hinge over here as well
and<00:04:45.320> then<00:04:45.440> you've<00:04:45.590> removes<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.250> outward

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
and then you've removes this outward

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.180 
and then you've removes this outward
like<00:04:46.849> this<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.389> go<00:04:47.479> outward<00:04:47.750> as<00:04:48.169> usual<00:04:48.590> on

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
like this it can go outward as usual on

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.730 
like this it can go outward as usual on
the<00:04:49.220> ball<00:04:49.849> joint<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.330> goes<00:04:50.539> down<00:04:50.779> his<00:04:51.349> vice<00:04:51.620> to

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
on eBay I'm not sure about the price I

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.310 
on eBay I'm not sure about the price I
think<00:06:14.180> he<00:06:14.570> might<00:06:14.750> be<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.960> little<00:06:15.229> bit

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
think he might be a little bit

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.899 
think he might be a little bit
overpriced<00:06:15.680> just<00:06:16.250> because<00:06:16.490> of<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.639> fact<00:06:16.820> that

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
overpriced just because of the fact that

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.610 
overpriced just because of the fact that
collectors<00:06:17.419> want<00:06:17.599> him<00:06:17.780> because<00:06:18.050> he<00:06:18.169> is<00:06:18.259> a<00:06:18.289> very

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
collectors want him because he is a very
