00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.849
 Good day to all friends with you

 ant and we continue to do today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.040
 Minecraft mods reviews, version 164 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.939
 and today dear friends i would like 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.590
 touch on that topic in general which 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.590
 I think it worries many 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.470
 Minecraft lacks bread and circuses 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.079
 when we fight mobs or mobs 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.880
 hostile mine bosses or creepers 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.950
 skeletons of zombies is not important and there is no 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 child that is accompanied by sound 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.240
 and there are no effects at all. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 came up here and so here zombies yes tyk tyk 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.620
 tyk knife lost it all he died 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.390
 no interest but now dear 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.700
 friends thanks to fashion battle music we 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 we can completely plunge into the battle with 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.520
 bosses or hostile mobs in the world 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 minecraft let's say we climb somewhere 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.030
 at 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.350
 what is our coniferous forest coniferous forest 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.119
 we climb it from nowhere 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 out of nowhere attack 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.520
 cave spider and we begin to play 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.530
 music from fantasy files and in my opinion it is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.749
 we stunned and then here and so well 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 a knife to return and he rub in the priests for 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:22.110
 we ran, we ran and we are the same type 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.530
 afraid and afraid we speak spider 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.750
 let's beat the guy 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 continues to play music that is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.550

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.620

 I downloaded the music here 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.600

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.160

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.509

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.640
