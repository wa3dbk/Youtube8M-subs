00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.160
 and a training option to be able 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.319
 fulfill because these gentlemen do 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.260
 fanciful interpretations to his own 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.969
 benefit and they established that for me 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.650
 to be able to earn my average that establishes the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.619
 transitory article of the law because 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 we achieved that a protection with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.800
 the just of the law the salaries the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.650
 workers were not seen 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 harmed affected and this is already 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 transitory article the law but these 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.810
 gentlemen the interpreter in such a way that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.880
 they said to beat your average 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 you have to sell two thousand products as 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.079
 example if I do not sell the two thousand 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 products I'm going to earn the average for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
 example of 200 thousand pesos if I sell thousand 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.670
 products thank you very much thousand pesos 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.440
 then they continue to force us to 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.809
 have to earn our salary 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.789
 at the expense of putting more product in the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 Customers' bag as the case 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.149
 What does Ceuta cost me for example? 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.059
 we have houses have inside famous 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.500
 scanner force us to have to go out to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.930
 deal with those in the meeting the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.610
 lighters of the gondolas because otherwise 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.430
 I 'm going to earn a bonus for compliance 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.110
 of waste or a bonus for compliance 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.130
 goals to keep getting more 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.799
 medicine medications we are not 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.750
 talking about the health of people and 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.270
 I still do not understand why the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.520
 state does not put a hand here because this is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.810
 would end all problems to the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.830
 medicines and the price of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 medicines 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.619
 it would end with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.979
 a subject so always with that the state 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.600
 they said there were 2002 of 200 so many 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.659
 products in evolution ok let's 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.030
 remove the most sensitive pathologies 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.940
 heart diabetes hypertension for 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.190
 mention some and with medicines that 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 prisoners are regulated by the state 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.090
 because they are afraid of that because every 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.759
 Once we have raised this 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.170
 possibility is not in Chile it is impossible 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.600
 Of course it's impossible because these 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.670
 studies as well constrictor said van 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.560
 to be no longer going to buy the three thousand 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.970
 and so many vehicles 299 will not continue 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.070
 profiting with the health of the three 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.619
 nations yarur or the new lords 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.200
 smoked pharmacy drivers for 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.780
 me where the Americans for me the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 solution some solutions is to break the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.459
 monopoly and in every hospital and in every 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.280
 certain size not consulting but if in 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.819
 every post there is a state pharmacy without 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 chocolate without fish houses without 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.660
 all this is sold 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.950
 at this price at 900 pesos instead of 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.500
 13,000 and ready I know there is already way 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.330
 lax to be benzine expected to run or be 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 burn to the bonze and will say that this 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.769
 it's a disaster it's going to Chile but there's the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.810
 level of caries regis mold of these 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.870
 criminals are the criminals 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.610
 not because lakes read has taken away the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.730
 law that punishes him are going to stop being a 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.530
 of these are the criminals to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.200
 catch to save the business the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 delinquents all chile especially 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.620
 that vulnerable issue has to spend 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.880
 millions and millions and millions every month 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 of the drug guarello mauricio you know 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.810
 what many people think of the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.549
 program with all kinds of end to day 4 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.569
 not the poor all but I appreciate the 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.489
 participation of people 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:19.889
 be what I think what moral cowardice 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.709
 finally from the authorities with clumsy 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.209
 I 'm nobody, it's the same, but howard 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.920
 and love to the authority to give 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.590
 account of this because this clear and the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.510
 you want program know it for years their 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.310
 children I can legitimately ask 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.720
 this is the relationship of the economy with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.370
 the policy there is an article 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.260
 interesting face to capitalism the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.870
 friends 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.640
 this model is made among friends the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.110
 capitalists who put the silver that 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.670
 can be capitalist left eye and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.930
 right not necessarily from the right 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.549
 it is true now it is transversal and the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.500
 political friends who keep the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.360
 system I see this issue that are 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.520
 won look but well so what 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 keep 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.120
 how not to face this for one thing 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.370
 what for a principle hair tube 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.370
 subsidiary subsidiarity and age as 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 say nothing 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.989
 is there any way to face it, we just 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.400
 is to claim here I believe that I 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.040
 I would like to make a call because of 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.140
 truth I taking advantage of a little what 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.909
 happened with the theme of the American Cup in 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.010
 what a sense and what they followed or not 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.049
 you can not continue to abuse the work 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.250
 in this beautiful one, I feel like a leader 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.010
 union that unfortunately 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.990
 the workers our country I understand 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.510
 that power or that power 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.070
 economic that the debts that have us 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.370
 trapped that often prevents us 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.080
 go out to protest going out to manifest the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.970
 discontent of what happens to us 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.580
 daily as Stephen escalate the issues so 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.680
 unworthy of my wife that at each 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 president length would have been exposed to 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.130
 show naked I do not understand how 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.410
 still in Chile the workers 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.450
 we allow it not to happen and this the lord 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.220
 they show us in press every time 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.630
 can crime delinquency and we 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.150
 they make all workers look like 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.480
 as criminals as programs like 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.490
 complaint of delinquency if they 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.740
 act with elin counting is point because 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.419
 they go and they steal a medicine from 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.130
 the gondola and them how much do they steal from 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.650
 pocket people with this overprice 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.050
 evolution is not the same is not what 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.400
 there's no cacerolazo for that, that's why 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.020
 that I believe and the call that I want 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.120
 to do is to all the workers that 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.250
 you are going to finish 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.050
 to end this passivity and 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.460
 face the big businessmen this 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.590
 country would go out to the street to the 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.140
 manifestation for pensions for 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.790
 medications with this because these 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.340
 Chileans who won 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.540
 America that we have left that we can 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.010
 break the story that the workers 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.170
 we can break readers that we can 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.490
 unite in order to finish with these beings 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.680
 that we continue to steal average normal 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.090
 pockets to all Chileans and the 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.790
 image I'm going to tell you something so awful 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.940
 in salcobrand in December I said it 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.730
 previously in another program think 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.380
 with the day December 24 they put him 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.290
 to the pocket the salary alignment the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.380
 jobs 24 the day of Christmas 300 thousand 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.020
 pesos on December 31st 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.120
 they removed it would be removed ligaments are 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.060
 the workers were left on the 31st of 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.560
 December without salary just because no 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.880
 they wanted those that the union more 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.980
 representative of the company could 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.440
 negotiate with a significant amount of 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.000
 workers and generate fear in the 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.560
 workers that's what they do what 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.390
 big businessmen you go to the cash 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.400
 they did that in green cross they had to 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.950
 all its subsidiaries strike in ways 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.170
 and they have not done exactly what 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.390
 a naturist company where they have 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.400
 past with side in all this but they have 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.409
 in their in their soil they did not have their 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.999
 the best is price 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.669

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:36.619

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:51.000
