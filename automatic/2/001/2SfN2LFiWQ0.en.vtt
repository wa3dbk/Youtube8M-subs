put it in at a downward angle twist it
to<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.290> right<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.829> then<00:02:30.129> push<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:31.829> and

to the right and then push it in and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.430 
to the right and then push it in and
that<00:02:34.180> really<00:02:34.390> helps<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> hold<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.110> bun<00:02:35.319> in

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and the hair is falling out then you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.160 
and the hair is falling out then you
probably<00:03:14.169> need<00:03:14.590> more<00:03:14.650> pins

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.370 

so<00:03:20.650> continue<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.190> wrap<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.580> hair<00:03:21.790> around

hairnets<00:04:22.949> larger<00:04:23.460> than<00:04:23.610> abundant<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.720> you'll

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
hairnets larger than abundant so you'll

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.040 
hairnets larger than abundant so you'll
need<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.199> wrap<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.470> around<00:04:25.560> twice<00:04:26.840> make<00:04:27.840> sure

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
need to wrap it around twice make sure

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.749 
need to wrap it around twice make sure

and then you can place it in now and

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.190 
and then you can place it in now and
that's<00:05:36.700> how<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:36.940> do<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.210> simple<00:05:37.539> ballet<00:05:37.930> bun

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
quite standard for something like an

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.260 
quite standard for something like an
exam<00:05:53.110> which<00:05:53.380> is<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.620> line<00:05:53.830> we<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.880> top<00:05:55.030> of<00:05:55.210> the

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
your bun is perfectly in the center and

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.409 
your bun is perfectly in the center and
so<00:06:08.380> that<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.620> don't<00:06:08.800> have<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.099> redo<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.580> but<00:06:10.270> at

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
so that you don't have to redo it but at

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.089 
so that you don't have to redo it but at
the<00:06:10.510> end<00:06:10.720> if<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:10.900> find<00:06:11.260> it<00:06:11.530> is<00:06:11.650> actually

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
the end if you find it is actually

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.909 
the end if you find it is actually
off-center<00:06:12.880> or<00:06:13.060> it's<00:06:13.840> looking<00:06:14.200> more<00:06:14.380> balling

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
off-center or it's looking more balling

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.550 
off-center or it's looking more balling
rather<00:06:15.220> than<00:06:15.520> being<00:06:15.729> nice<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.210> flat<00:06:16.510> then<00:06:17.320> you

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
rather than being nice and flat then you

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.500 
rather than being nice and flat then you
should<00:06:17.770> actually<00:06:17.950> restart<00:06:18.669> your<00:06:18.910> hair<00:06:19.210> so

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
should actually restart your hair so

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.170 
should actually restart your hair so
take<00:06:19.780> it<00:06:19.930> out<00:06:20.130> resend<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.280> your<00:06:21.520> ponytail

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
take it out resend to your ponytail

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.360 
take it out resend to your ponytail
twist<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.139> around<00:06:23.229> and<00:06:23.710> you'll<00:06:23.919> find<00:06:24.160> with

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
twist it around and you'll find with

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.800 
twist it around and you'll find with
practice<00:06:24.820> it<00:06:25.030> doesn't<00:06:25.389> take<00:06:25.570> that<00:06:25.599> long

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
practice it doesn't take that long

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.960 
practice it doesn't take that long
that's<00:06:26.560> up<00:06:26.770> for<00:06:26.950> something<00:06:27.280> important<00:06:27.789> like

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
that's up for something important like

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.850 
that's up for something important like
in<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.210> examination<00:06:28.930> or<00:06:29.050> a<00:06:29.080> performance<00:06:29.650> the

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
in the examination or a performance the

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.320 
in the examination or a performance the
bun<00:06:30.010> really<00:06:30.340> should<00:06:30.520> be<00:06:30.639> very<00:06:30.970> close<00:06:31.150> to

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
bun really should be very close to

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.870 
bun really should be very close to
