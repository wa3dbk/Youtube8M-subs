00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 hello dear hungry because of the title 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.390
 really should not be scared there 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.890
 nothing reprehensible at all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.750
 not sexist and certainly 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.310
 nothing misogynist this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 Pastagenicht has one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 historical background i have it as 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 one of the most prestigious Italian 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 cook magazines of the league and in it 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.149
 can be read 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.219
 I quote it's called spaghetti alla bout 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
 talisker so spaghetti after kind of 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.450
 ears have their disreputable increases 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 beginning of the twentieth century of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.280
 operator of a pleasure house in the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 to receive lodgings from naples july 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.640
 He should thus his clientele 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 have fed because the court 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 was quick and easy to prepare 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 So that's clear and he had 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 Law 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.550
 you will see the preparation is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.510
 really easy and does not require 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.149
 a lot of time we need spaghetti 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 peeled tomatoes some anchovies 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.430
 black in rising olives one or 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 Two garlic size dependent cup 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 something to a small chili 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 fresh basil that's the only one 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.390
 Deviation from the original dish I 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.189
 allowed me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.990
 for there parsley is used i 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.450
 but find basil fit better to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 we need olive oil and salt 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.740
 we start with the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.509
 Preparatory work as there would be 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.090
 black olives are being sliced 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 sliced 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.490
 even the garlic cloves become small 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.590
 chopped or cut 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.670
 slicing the chili pepper along and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.799
 remove the cores 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 that is, whoever wants it on 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.310
 Of course, you can leave it in there, too 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 then cut the pod small 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.119
 and the roadway which we previously from 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.689
 felt and then dried off 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.210
 will also be downsized and preserved 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.070
 she's done in the preparation and we 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.560
 Heat a breakdown three to four 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 tablespoons olive oil we give the small ones 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 cut block run 10 and the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.090
 chili pod in wait for everything shortly 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.739
 in former times also sometimes 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.140
 then reduce the heat and add the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.420
 Anchor much to add this last you so 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 Fry for two minutes until you are done 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.299
 as you can see, you fall by yourself 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 then the little bodies come in 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.830
 the trap 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.780
 just as the olives rings everything 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.340
 perform and then at low heat 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.870
 Stew everything for another two minutes 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.239
 Finally, we give the peeled 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.630
 tomatoes with crush in the fall 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.269
 These with a fork and leave without 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.470
 to increase the energy previously everything only 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.470
 simmer for about 10 minutes 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.470
 in parallel we bring enough 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.660
 salted water to boil the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.209
 spaghetti in and cook this al 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.400
 So dente dente thereafter, the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.690
 Pour spaghetti and put into the pan 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.140
 added to the sauce 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.959
 in the case of short swivel or 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.850
 mix with the prepared sauce and 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.120
 we are done with that and you could 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.250
 See that went quickly 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.170
 Serving has some of the fresh 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.870
 basil small and gives it to the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.630
 spaghetti and grated parmesan or 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.299
 pecorino round off this pasta dish 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.880
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.579
 preparation and a pretty good one 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.660
 appetite 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.489
 but if you have another one 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.160
 For example, a pasta dish is better 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.989
 spaghetti frankfurter carbonara or 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.510
 also a low-calorie steak 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.519
 vegetable pan with potato noodles then 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.250
 just have a look in these videos 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.050
 in 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.820
 you still have to say until the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.820
 next time bye bye
