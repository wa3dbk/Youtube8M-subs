00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.219
 hi all guys are the echoes from there 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.580
 today we are here in the third episode of the 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.289
 broken max like in any road to marx 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.180
 let's start immediately with seeing the buildings 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.670
 which I improved during this 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.650
 week we see immediately that I'm done 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.420
 to build the hicks bow and built 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.730
 also at all hell from 1 to level 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.859
 two ie level 2 cost 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.810
 6 million and 500 now I will also put the 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.700
 second is just that they are not anyway 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.700
 a few 6 million and a half and puts us 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.020
 ten days so not bad for how long 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.880
 concerns the rest of the village and not 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.660
 we have substantial psycho fit changes 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.720
 physiological 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 apart from these terms I randomly put 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.540
 the barbarian from level 13 to level 14 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.290
 then I'll put it level 15 and then I'll do the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.660
 reggina from 12 and 15 and I put this 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.970
 cannon from 89 and the tower of the archer 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.130
 from 8 to 9 so let's say I'll bring them in 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.770
 equal to then I see what to do 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.600
 then I also put the lab in 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.400
 level 7 arrives lot and so I will 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.650
 certainly immediately troops a 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.450
 maximum level as I had for example 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.030
 in mind to make dragons at 4 which they are 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.250
 really a devastating thing and then 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 let's see I will definitely do the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.420
 spell factory because a 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.540
 extra spell can really do 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.990
 the war difference and no boys 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.890
 says normal things risotto is born is 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.440
 a clan 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.110
 we say not very strong but let's say they are 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.659
 I know all my friends more or less 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.310
 so everyone is not that you are not 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.010
 welcome but we have closed the clan 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.690
 because anyway we prefer for now 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.920
 stay between us because we know each other 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.799
 all 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.759
 at school together we do basketball together 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.700
 so we are all caste part therefore 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.080
 I don't know now let's see if you can enter 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 if you can't enter 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.320
 if we do an academy I don't know well 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.320
 guys will talk about it in the next videos 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.259
 so I can't even write inshaat 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.709
 greet youtube let's have someone there 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:17.290
 know 2 helps with the daily smiley face 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.610
 instead of the page they treat you very happy 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 faith that it is beautiful ok and let's see if 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.900
 someone there is a replay or some 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.060
 reply file play keycode to show it 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.440
 in fact I will not show you this attack I have 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.239
 done in flight the first attack has it 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.730
 done against the first of the clan 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.140
 versailles that is not very strong though 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.600
 anyway I couldn't do two 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.690
 stars with hot air balloon drives are 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.730
 also satisfied I stuck with drive 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.239
 and hot air balloons I put the archers first 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.190
 here on the sides we say to address the i 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.079
 dragons and then the hot air balloons to us alone 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.959
 we are born can become a ball 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.370
 monstrous and in my opinion there are boys 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.270
 this strategy is truly a new one 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.640
 very strong for the clan war 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.590
 I only imagine what could happen 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.210
 with driver 4 because it will really be 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.530
 an ethical thing, I said, I already have the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.380
 troops ready to do the second 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.790
 attack but I prefer not to do it because 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.100
 we are in a conflict, that is, precisely 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.170
 I think you can still win the 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.910
 war and so I wanted to do the last one 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.850
 attack we say at the end to see 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.390
 What is the player that I can do 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
 more stars and then see what to do not 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.210
 I know what 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.430
 now here we see that I destroyed the 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.480
 town hall I managed to make two 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.530
 stars among other things without heroes without 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.020
 reggina and without a barbarian king 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.700
 the reference is therefore I could not have 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.980
 then use the right ricin for 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.350
 do some percentage and nothing 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.850
 guys a nice thing about these 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.140
 attacks and that last very little 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.080
 because that is, you put in degrees 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.020
 hot air balloons in pam furie in 20 seconds 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.550
 then they destroyed half a village 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.100
 they are really cool to see 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.410
 I think therefore I hope there is light 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.970
 liked the reggina and nothing now 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.430
 precisely he did a moment a little 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.150
 percentage and then I finished for per 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.850
 save this this a third of 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.220
 life of the queen so let's go home 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.400
 and I said I won't make attacks live 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.489
 because unfortunately I don't have enough 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.979
 that is, I wanted to wait at least a moment 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.729
 half an hour from the end to see how 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.729
 we are put 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.080
 and let's go see some I don't know 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.620
 attack I did see if anyone 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.440
 has sent ok attacks if we use 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.360
 at the basics you think this is in here 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.860
 class with me so that we are there 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.860
 we all know this clan anyway 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.210
 so I don't know if it's worthwhile to enter or 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.220
 no if he had more or less than 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.930
 so the blues intruders that is not there 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.580
 very convenient 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.349
 I said we are 35 46 we hope to win 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.110
 it can still be done because anyway 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.419
 we have only 26 attacks and almost all 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.960
 have not yet made second attack 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.599
 so we hope we hope to do it and 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.789
 take please let's scrub I said already 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.560
 that I am there I show some attacks 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.540
 I've done over the years 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.400
 so perfect to say no more beautiful play 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.780
 to really show these here are 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.330
 scandalous so I don't do it 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.190
 see why there's just so attacked 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.750
 just in case to get rid of the troops 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.740
 and make those for war 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.780
 so unfortunately they really suck 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.690
 defenses attacked me with barbarians and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.900
 rhubarb so i'm sorry guys 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.820
 no replay tv in this max 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.010
 so guys for this video was 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.620
 all left but I like to sign up 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.450
 commented try to make a broken one 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.570
 I don't know if Friday is my week 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.150
 Saturday that depends because I wanted to type 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.090
 say you guys are let's say here in the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.540
 gameplay is saved which would sound a lot 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.610
 very well here maybe we will make a device a 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.610
 Saturday though I don't know why anyway 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.310
 week we say is a little long thing 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.900
 although there is still we say that these 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.730
 difficult at this level put us 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.830
 really a life to improve 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.420
 then from one week to the next then 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.000
 there would not be so many new features 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.950
 so let's maybe mince one every two 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.050
 weeks do not know write me below if 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.670
 you like that you want to see so many one 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.540
 you want to see a few or want to see it 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.260
 more then hello to everyone to the next 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.260
 video
