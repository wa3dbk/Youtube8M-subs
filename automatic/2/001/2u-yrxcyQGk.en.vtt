00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.930
 Hi, I'm Ariana. Now I'm a nutritionist. 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.549
 and I'm the founder of me, today we're going to 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.010
 talk to you about the nutritional value of 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.349
 area the arepa is a typical food of 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.840
 venezuela and from colombia and is made of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.970
 precooked corn flour this is 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.619
 enriched with vitamins of group b and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.289
 iron that's why its great nutritional value 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.359
 if we think of a medium-sized flu more or 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.520
 less than this size around 100 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.340
 grams we are talking about an area for 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.860
 around 120 calories that really 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.989
 It is very low in calories however 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.019
 they are rich nutrients that feed 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.300
 a lot then I could suggest to you that 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.010
 consume arepa maybe a little more 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.229
 frequent and that we lose a bit of 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 fear towards this food in instagram 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.610
 they asked us a question that was better 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.979
 the white arepa or the epa with fiber 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.199
 integral arepa if we prepare the 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.360
 arepa and we place the fiber like oats 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.460
 in flakes you're really a bit more 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.350
 healthy because this type of fiber that is 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 soluble fiber has some 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.729
 properties and helps us lower 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.619
 cholesterol triglycerides sugar improves 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.940
 the intestinal transit then 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.190
 we would have better evacuations 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.170
 and it helped us prevent cancers but 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.720
 if when we are preparing it we are 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.640
 using bran really this the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.500
 only property is to improve the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.300
 intestinal transit then you have to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.730
 choose well what type of fiber we are going to 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.040
 put I recommend placing veins not 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.840
 come back or some kind of grated vegetable 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.610
 what can be carrot can be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.740
 beet kind of being spinach that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.260
 they are very tasty another of the questions 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.660
 of insta grasita that the arepa was better 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.460
 of corn to share when we talk about 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
 the lep Andean changed its value a little 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030
 nutritional because it adds many 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.340
 ingredients generally for your 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.250
 preparation we put wheat flour 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.720
 some sugar or paper we need to put 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.270
 also some fat can be 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.970
 butter or it can be oil already have 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 all these foods really is better 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 the maize 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 many people wonder what 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.439
 size should be the sand 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.440
 the arepa for a woman would be ideal 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.200
 make it this size by joining your fingers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.179
 and make it thin if we're talking about 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.580
 the arepa of a man we have to be a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.209
 little bit more generous and make a arepa 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.160
 Larger than the size of a music CD 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.810
 more or less of this size many will 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.970
 they ask about the nutritional value of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.010
 arepa and this will vary a lot depending on the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.500
 filling that you place if we do 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.800
 of large bold letters we place you 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.819
 butter cheese cream mayonnaise or cheese 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.250
 yellow we are increasing 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.470
 considerably the nutritional value 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.110
 of stare to see if before eating it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.390
 we take out the dough a little or previously 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.060
 Granite solution and place that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.550
 let's go up in calories than your white guys 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.190
 ricota or we could use cheeses type 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.160
 country or we could place something else the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.040
 meatloaf turkey I will be to have 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.319
 fewer calories at what time you should eat the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.190
 arepa you can add it at breakfast 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.720
 at lunch 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.180
 It really is one of my favorite dinners 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.700
 because it really satisfies me and apart from 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.160
 to sate I know that it is a very low food 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.200
 in calories apart from this is a 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.210
 very versatile food because we can 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.570
 change the fillings daily 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.450
 could you use cason can we use 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.850
 ground beef ground meat can you 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.670
 place low fat cheeses you can 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.280
 place turkey you can place parrot and the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 parakeet do it with various vegetables 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.640
 they can use tomato but also 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.400
 can use aubergines that is 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.490
 very rich and in all these areas always 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.320
 I could place some vegetables 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.360
 tomato is very tasty and also 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.950
 you can put maybe some alfalfa 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.040
 like to do a arepa a little bit more 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.380
 exotic before I remember not to remove the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.630
 scene can return the arepa one of your 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.120
 favorite foods and take off 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.460
