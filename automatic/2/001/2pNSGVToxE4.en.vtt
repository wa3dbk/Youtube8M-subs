00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
probably the main aim of my strivers not

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.450 
probably the main aim of my strivers not
only<00:01:17.380> for<00:01:17.530> Porsche<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.950> think<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:18.250> general

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
only for Porsche I think in general
