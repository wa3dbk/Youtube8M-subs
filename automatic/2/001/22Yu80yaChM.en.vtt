00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.050 
it from what I've watched is just a new
version<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.340> decoder<00:02:29.340> box<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.880> stuff

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
version of the decoder box and stuff

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.180 
version of the decoder box and stuff
probably<00:02:31.050> nothing<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.500> majorly<00:02:31.950> different

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
probably nothing to majorly different

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.550 
probably nothing to majorly different
besides<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> fact<00:02:35.460> obviously<00:02:36.420> that's<00:02:36.600> 7.1

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
besides the fact obviously that's 7.1

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
besides the fact obviously that's 7.1
and<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.860> know<00:02:37.920> people<00:02:38.250> are<00:02:38.490> like<00:02:38.670> oh<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.090> only

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and I know people are like oh it's only

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.560 
and I know people are like oh it's only
got<00:02:39.810> two<00:02:40.170> speakers<00:02:40.590> each<00:02:40.920> 40<00:02:41.790> millimeters<00:02:42.300> but

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
got two speakers each 40 millimeters but

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.630 
got two speakers each 40 millimeters but
I<00:02:42.680> think<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.770> more<00:02:43.830> they're<00:02:44.190> going<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.580> like

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
I think it's more they're going for like

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640 
I think it's more they're going for like
the<00:02:44.820> virtual<00:02:45.330> surround<00:02:45.570> sound<00:02:45.960> as<00:02:46.080> opposed<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the virtual surround sound as opposed to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.650 
the virtual surround sound as opposed to
you<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.550> physical<00:02:48.000> surround<00:02:48.360> sound<00:02:48.570> of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
you know the physical surround sound of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.300 
you know the physical surround sound of
having<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.080> bunch<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> different<00:02:49.650> speakers<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
having a bunch of different speakers and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.540 
having a bunch of different speakers and
then<00:02:50.850> diversifying<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.920> audio<00:02:52.920> channels<00:02:53.430> or

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
then diversifying the audio channels or

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.850 
then diversifying the audio channels or
whatever<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.910> want<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> word<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.680> i'm

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
whatever you want to word it as and i'm
