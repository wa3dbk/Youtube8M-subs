psychological<00:00:06.000> hurdle<00:00:06.240> as<00:00:06.330> much<00:00:06.509> as<00:00:06.660> anything

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
psychological hurdle as much as anything

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.230 
psychological hurdle as much as anything
finding<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> racket<00:00:07.920> that<00:00:08.069> felt<00:00:09.000> like<00:00:09.090> an

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
finding a racket that felt like an

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.209 
finding a racket that felt like an
extension<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.870> hand<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.770> not<00:00:10.950> easy

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
extension of my hand was was not easy

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.949 
extension of my hand was was not easy
and<00:00:11.520> then<00:00:11.639> switching<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> X<00:00:12.299> red<00:00:12.600> felt

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
and then switching to the X red felt

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.449 
and then switching to the X red felt
really<00:00:13.139> comfortable<00:00:13.680> and<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.949> was<00:00:14.010> giving<00:00:14.340> me

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
really comfortable and it was giving me

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.359 
really comfortable and it was giving me
more<00:00:14.699> than<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.440> then<00:00:16.440> my<00:00:16.560> prior<00:00:16.830> racket<00:00:17.279> was

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
more than then then my prior racket was

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
more than then then my prior racket was
giving<00:00:17.730> me<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:17.940> given<00:00:18.180> me<00:00:18.240> more<00:00:18.390> stick<00:00:18.750> on

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
giving me it's given me more stick on

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.630 
giving me it's given me more stick on
the<00:00:19.050> ball<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.650> still<00:00:19.859> felt<00:00:20.130> comfortable<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the ball but it still felt comfortable I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.359 
the ball but it still felt comfortable I
could<00:00:20.820> still<00:00:21.029> create<00:00:21.269> angles<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.250> for<00:00:23.250> me

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
could still create angles and for me

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.489 
could still create angles and for me
that's<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.419> I'm<00:00:24.539> looking<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.169> when

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
that's that's what I'm looking for when

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.169 
that's that's what I'm looking for when
I'm<00:00:25.589> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> court<00:00:25.980> playing<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.089> to

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
I'm on the court playing I don't want to

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.150 
I'm on the court playing I don't want to
ever<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> racket<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.230> wonder<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
ever look in my racket and wonder if I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
ever look in my racket and wonder if I
made<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.339> mistake<00:00:29.519> whether<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.509> because<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
made a mistake whether it's because the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
made a mistake whether it's because the
racket<00:00:31.349> did<00:00:31.529> something<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.919> I<00:00:32.040> wasn't

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
racket did something that I wasn't

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
racket did something that I wasn't
expecting<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.970> want<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.720> know<00:00:33.960> what's<00:00:34.350> coming

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
expecting I want to know what's coming

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.800 
expecting I want to know what's coming
from<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> racket<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:36.000> why<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> X<00:00:36.570> Red

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
from the racket and that's why the X Red

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.900 
from the racket and that's why the X Red
was<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.080> really<00:00:37.650> easy<00:00:37.830> switch<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.490> me<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.700> felt

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
was a really easy switch for me it felt

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
was a really easy switch for me it felt
very<00:00:39.030> natural<00:00:39.240> when<00:00:39.900> a<00:00:39.930> racket<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> becomes<00:00:40.740> an

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
very natural when a racket it becomes an

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.350 
very natural when a racket it becomes an
extension<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.490> hand<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.000> no<00:00:42.180> longer

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
extension of your hand you're no longer

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
extension of your hand you're no longer
thinking<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.380> equipment<00:00:43.650> at<00:00:44.010> all

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
thinking about your equipment at all

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
thinking about your equipment at all
you're<00:00:44.910> thinking<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.720> I<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you're thinking about what do I need to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.390 
you're thinking about what do I need to
do<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> beat<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.440> player<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.040> other<00:00:47.100> side

do to beat this player on the other side

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.310 
do to beat this player on the other side
of<00:00:47.490> the<00:00:47.580> net<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.630> you're<00:00:48.810> wondering<00:00:49.260> about

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of the net so if you're wondering about

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920 
of the net so if you're wondering about
your<00:00:49.650> equipment<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.330> or<00:00:51.450> two<00:00:51.600> percent

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
your equipment even one or two percent

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
your equipment even one or two percent
of<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:53.100> percent

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of the time that's one or two percent

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
of the time that's one or two percent
too<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:53.880> too<00:00:54.060> often

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.150 

well<00:00:57.460> it's<00:00:57.789> uh<00:00:57.910> it's<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.710> little<00:00:59.920> thicker

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
well it's uh it's it's a little thicker

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.990 
well it's uh it's it's a little thicker
racket<00:01:00.699> then<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.109> ex<00:01:02.260> read<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.850> that

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
racket then then the ex read then that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.690 
racket then then the ex read then that
series<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:05.619> just<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:06.009> has<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.220> little<00:01:06.580> bit

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
series and it just it has a little bit

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.170 
series and it just it has a little bit
more<00:01:06.759> pop<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.450> I'm<00:01:08.380> not<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.460> savant<00:01:09.880> of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
more pop to it I'm not the the savant of

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.420 
more pop to it I'm not the the savant of
technology<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.229> tell<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:11.500> exactly<00:01:11.619> why<00:01:12.159> and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
technology to tell you exactly why and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.240 
technology to tell you exactly why and
we<00:01:12.580> have<00:01:12.789> to<00:01:12.909> ask<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.210> engineers<00:01:13.979> why<00:01:14.979> that's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
we have to ask the engineers why that's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.950 
we have to ask the engineers why that's
the<00:01:15.460> case<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.909> just<00:01:16.149> know<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.570> be<00:01:16.600> true<00:01:16.750> I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the case I just know it to be true I

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.200 
the case I just know it to be true I
know<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:17.860> easier<00:01:18.250> power<00:01:18.520> for<00:01:19.090> me

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
know that it's easier power for me

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.350 
know that it's easier power for me
consistently<00:01:20.190> well<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.220> think<00:01:21.360> equipment

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
consistently well I think equipment

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.719 
consistently well I think equipment
becomes<00:01:22.600> more<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.020> more<00:01:23.110> important<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:24.009> an

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
becomes more and more important for an

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.160 
becomes more and more important for an
aging<00:01:25.030> tennis<00:01:25.330> player<00:01:25.539> I've<00:01:25.659> certainly<00:01:25.840> found

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
aging tennis player I've certainly found

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.779 
aging tennis player I've certainly found
that<00:01:26.380> I'm<00:01:26.530> getting<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.159> benefit<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.580> now

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
that I'm getting the benefit of now

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.180 
that I'm getting the benefit of now
playing<00:01:28.149> with<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.840> XP<00:01:29.200> dual<00:01:29.409> which<00:01:29.710> has<00:01:29.890> more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
playing with the XP dual which has more

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.790 
playing with the XP dual which has more
power<00:01:30.460> than<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:31.090> X<00:01:31.240> Red<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.560> making

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
power than the X Red and that's making

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.370 
power than the X Red and that's making
it<00:01:33.009> easier<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.460> my<00:01:33.640> body<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.450> think<00:01:34.479> that's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
it easier on my body and I think that's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
it easier on my body and I think that's
one<00:01:35.619> of<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.800> real<00:01:35.979> benefits<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.090> advances

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
one of the real benefits of the advances

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.109 
one of the real benefits of the advances
in<00:01:37.750> technology<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.380> tennis<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.069> is<00:01:39.460> you

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
in technology and tennis is is you

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.840 
in technology and tennis is is you
really<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.690> take<00:01:40.960> advantage<00:01:41.440> of<00:01:41.670> what's<00:01:42.670> out

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
really can take advantage of what's out

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.230 
really can take advantage of what's out
there

corner too much what I find with with
the<00:02:46.300> Zeen<00:02:46.599> core<00:02:46.810> technologies<00:02:47.409> I<00:02:47.590> find<00:02:47.860> that

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
the Zeen core technologies I find that

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.940 
the Zeen core technologies I find that
the<00:02:48.550> racquets<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.349> pretty<00:02:50.349> vibration

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
the racquets are pretty vibration

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.860 
the racquets are pretty vibration
sensitive<00:02:51.849> already<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.540> know<00:02:52.629> you<00:02:52.780> don't

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
sensitive already you know you don't

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.110 
sensitive already you know you don't
really<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.409> add<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.950> vibration<00:02:54.640> dampener

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
really have to add a vibration dampener

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.460 
really have to add a vibration dampener
unless<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.629> like<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.959> look<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.290> feel

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
