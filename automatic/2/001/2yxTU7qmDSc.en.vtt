00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.580
 the goose is in the municipal school 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.470
 comfort in uberlandia to install 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 solar panels that prove that the energy 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.149
 Solar is already a reality in Brazil 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 are 48 panels that will generate about 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.050
 50% of all electricity consumed 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 here and bring several benefits 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 social and environmental 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.879
 one of these benefits is more education 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.649
 for the 700 students who study here already 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 that all the economy generated by the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.070
 will be returned to the school that goes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.820
 have to use this money to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.010
 promote more activities 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 extracurricular activities with students 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
 the project also has the reinforcement of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 solar multipliers a group of 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.530
 young people selected and trained by 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.420
 to spread the message in the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.770
 brazilian that solar energy is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.770
 the solution we need 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.920
 a great benefit that this project 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 brought to our city ​​is also the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 the issue of empowering people to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.259
 working in the so-called 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.420
 green jobs in the 12-month period 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.759
 increased by ten times the use of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.680
 people doing this kind of work 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.680
 and use of solar energy 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.970
 I felt like part of a revolution 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.240
 is because now children will get 50% 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.520
 of their energy coming from clean energy 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.560
 an infinite good democratic energy 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.830
 besides being part of a process 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.380
 of a knowledge phase 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.450
 I was part of a transformation and mode 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.030
 thinking about how to act 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.760
 children now she knows how much she 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.820
 the sun is important is the solution for everything 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.820
 world 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.430
 such is the case of Búzios is a holy mother but the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 say and do this multiplication and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.260
 demonstrate the feasibility of the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.480
 solar energy and children absorb and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.890
 with an ease and can 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 multiply this knowledge much more 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
 faster than we who actually are 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.740
 they are going to do to change 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.740
 preservation of the environment
