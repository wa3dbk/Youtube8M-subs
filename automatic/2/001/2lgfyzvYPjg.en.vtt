00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, how are you doing so well? 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.470
 ablation we are in minecraft with a mod 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.630
 of armor support a mobile that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 the truth is excellent and I know 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.409
 I recommend all of you let's see it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.009
 what is it about and my mother watkins this 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.869
 they are armors that are in a support 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.759
 that the truth is excellent for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 decorate in would be good to put it 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.300
 in the final version of the main care van 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.509
 some in some modification because I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.199
 I think it will serve so much for 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.760
 for adventure maps that give you a 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.829
 shelf so armor you can 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.659
 pick up you would be excellent or 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.159
 simply for decoration but the 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.449
 I really think that this has to 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.820
 be in the final version of minecraft 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.060
 I see it very well and I see it possible 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.190
 there they can do it 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.180
 and it would be excellent how it is done 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.800
 this very easy 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 remember that I leave it in the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.110
 description this is for version 1.3 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.300
 point 2 of minecraft for 1.4 points 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.040
 still not available if they take it out 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.160
 I'm going to update the link and put it 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.110
 but well how do you do this what you 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.700
 I would have to do is this this shelf 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 that is here we do not do it very 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 easily with the sticks and the stone 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.140
 the normal stone 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.210
 we put three sacks and two sticks up 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.290
 and we form the harmonium stand we are going to put 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.549
 a little bit more we're going to because everything 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.979
 it got better it gets everything we got all this already 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 that we have the aromo stand we are going to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.500
 try it to see how 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.500
 one for nothing 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.910
 what happens that has sensitivity as 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.280
 like all the mine that they have to put 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.980
 I justito the orientation to where you 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.490
 you want to put them if you do not go crooked like that 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.920
 how good are we going to see we are going to put this 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.110
 armor and the diamond is the best 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.490
 of all the pepes are coming down and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.960
 in the micro I do not know what is happening but 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.080
 well let's continue here 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.250
 Lets put 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.250
 let's put this 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.400
 and that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400
 and as you see there we have it 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.910
 As it looks empty it is ugly and has no 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440
 thank you very much we are still here without a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.239
 see if gentlemen are rather lowered the fps 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.690
 but remarkably I had to restart the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.519
 computer I went from 30 fps to 17 15 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.290
 and it was getting horrible so good 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.250
 let's say with this with this review 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.450
 of the mod 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.170
 as I said it is ugly like that when it's 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.910
 transparent and like he has nothing 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 we have the option to choose nothing or 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.190
 be as it is there that a person wants 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.160
 black let's say 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 a zombie the player and the char that would be 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570
 the same as the player but it depends 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.960
 depending on what we have configured by 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:54.150
 example the player is this and is good and 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.590
 well let's put one here we are going to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.850
 put on the best armor that the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.400
 minecraft the epic the best 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.530
 let's put a zombie here the truth 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.680
 this super decorative is excellent 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.390
 I love it, I'd like you to put it on 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.030
 final version of the game as I say 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.050
 I hope they put it and for me it's what they 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.420
 to do what they are going to do they are going to finish 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.730
 making this sure so good this 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.860
 it would be basically everything remember that the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.510
 link is in the video description yo 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.350
 I leave you see us in the next one 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.350
