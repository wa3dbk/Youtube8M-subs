to<00:02:40.630> move<00:02:40.780> away<00:02:41.080> from<00:02:41.349> trade<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.660> coins

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
to move away from trade and coins

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.530 
to move away from trade and coins
actually<00:02:44.319> became<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.980> marketable<00:02:45.700> currency

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
actually became a marketable currency

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.059 
actually became a marketable currency
and<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:46.959> decided<00:02:47.290> said<00:02:47.530> that's<00:02:47.920> great

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
and so we decided said that's great

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.160 
and so we decided said that's great
because<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:49.180> want<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.390> have<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.959> game

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
because we want to have it for the game

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.039 
because we want to have it for the game
and<00:02:50.440> our<00:02:50.860> subject<00:02:51.430> tell<00:02:51.849> us<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.930> know

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
and our subject tell us that you know

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.170 
and our subject tell us that you know
makes<00:02:53.470> sense<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.489> combine<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> two<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
makes sense so we combine the two and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.729 
makes sense so we combine the two and
that's<00:02:55.420> why<00:02:55.569> there's<00:02:55.750> an<00:02:55.840> economic<00:02:56.230> system<00:02:56.410> in

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
that's why there's an economic system in

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.680 
that's why there's an economic system in
