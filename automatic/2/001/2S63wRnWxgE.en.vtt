00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello and welcome today I you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.290
 demonstrate five stretching exercises 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 extremely profitable for all 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.139
 benefits that they will bring me in the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.049
 minimum time 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.089
 first exercise we will stretch at once 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.119
 the gluteus maximus and at the same time the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.100
 quadriceps while mobilizing the column 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.630
 vertebral especially the part 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.910
 thoracic spine in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.330
 twist so I'm going to put myself in 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 lying down position bring back the knee and the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 block as much as possible in position 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.600
 high what will put the gluteus maximus 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.300
 in stretching position I will bring back 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.550
 talent towards the buttocks and well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.160
 contracted the buttocks here so as to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 inhibit the iliopsoas and the right 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 prior is in this position all 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.670
 gently I will leave my body 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.110
 to go in rotation to put the head on the ground 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 and in this kind of stretching that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.809
 realizes statically it is very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.640
 important to be able to breathe with the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.399
 belly ie having a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.860
 abdominal breathing 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.680
 to know more do not hesitate to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.720
 check out my blog at keeping up 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.170
 whenever twenty seconds is 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.100
 release we reproduce exactly 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.290
 the exercise on the other side I you the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 shows from another angle 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 so I bring my knee back to the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.130
 chest play the block I bring back the heel 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.500
 towards the buttock I contract the buttocks that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.670
 is on the ground and I will leave it gently 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 my body december and open up while 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.310
 breathing with the abdomen for 20 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 seconds 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.070
 ok so to realize right and left 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.040
 second exercise we will work here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.689
 a leg in extension what I you 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 suggests is to contract the buttock of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.950
 support and come here laid a hand at 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 ground while bringing back here well the tip 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.140
 foot towards you so as to put 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.119
 the entire posterior chain in position 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 stretching so that's the position 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.630
 we will say the simplest people 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 the steepest will eventually 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.819
 lean on their rollers 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.970
 self-massage backrest cushion 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.890
 most flexible people 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.690
 here will be able to work in this 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.060
 position and if you really want 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.550
 look for a lot more movement 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.790
 complete we will induce a movement of 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.440
 rotation to really stretch all the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.070
 posterior chain is also the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 side chain here so always the same 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.090
 I must be able to breathe with the abdomen 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.520
 which means that my body is 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.650
 able to relax well and with a 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.050
 diaphragmatic ventral breathing and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.850
 I release we perform of course 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.450
 for 20 seconds the exercise of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.540
 the other side 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.170
 so I take my position I put my 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.120
 hand on the ground 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.440
 I bring my toes back and for the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.540
 the most flexible people jeanne duye 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.500
 in stretch 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.120
 so this movement of the poles is 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.730
 interesting especially if you make some 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.580
 movements and sports in which 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.190
 there is running 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.240
 because finally we place the poles in 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.170
 the position we find in the race 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.750
 position that is sometimes limited and one 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.970
 released 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.450
 from there we will immediately follow up with 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.310
 a simple exercise for the inside of 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.650
 thighs the inner thighs which is 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.080
 very very important in order to stretch well 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.989
 both here adductors and at the same time 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.290
 time mobilize the joint capsule 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.510
 of the hip so two possibilities either 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.580
 I will work in a static way in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.330
 letting my knees open well 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.019
 laterally 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.120
 either I'll be able to gently mobilize 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.440
 hips more dynamically 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:06.120
 always respecting the rule of 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:07.680
 no pain here so if your flexibility 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.540
 do not allow it to stay in 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.670
 position off if your flexibility you the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.220
 allows you of course get off in 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.780
 opening more importantly a 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.160
 once we maintain the stretch for a 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 twenty seconds where we perform 20 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.600
 mobilization back and forth and we're going 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.720
 immediately performed the stretch 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.300
 opposite ie stretching the big 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.950
 pyramidal butt that I'm going to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.880
 show from two different angles so 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.070
 the first one you go up the game we 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.490
 position our foot in rotation 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:50.640
 internally and pose the game our backs 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.410
 to then go down to the front so 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.210
 I'm really trying to place you well 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.510
 will really feel the stretch here 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:02.810
 in the pyramid I can have brought back a 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.430
 a little bit more the back knee 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.790
 inwards which accentuates the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.790
 stretch 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.800
 again I maintain the stretch 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.470
 for 20 seconds I release so if 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.690
 I show it to you in another angle 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.630
 here I bring my knee inwards 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.880
 and I'm going to put my knee back 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.600
 to the ground I pose the young back 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.850
 to the ground 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.930
 and here I go down all of my 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:37.870
 torso forward to stretch the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:45.400
 pyramidal again maintaining 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.830
 20 seconds and let go and do it 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.160
 you are going to work on a stretch 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.370
 a lot more overall on the whole here 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.130
 of the side chain of the arm we will 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.280
 place face down on the arm in 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:04.870
 extension and I'm going to drive the whole 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.380
 of the body so as to stretch this well 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.060
 side chain to note for 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.890
 the most flexible people you 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.640
 can additionally slightly mount your 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:19.540
 knee or stretch your leg to have 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:24.970
 an even more complete stretch so at 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:28.930
 perform 20 seconds in one direction and 20 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:33.030
 seconds from each other always having 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.740
 abdominal breathing 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:42.490
 diaphragmatic to drive well the 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:45.010
 looseness and I relax to find out 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.780
 more precisely on the different 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.510
 stretching methods and especially when 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.620
 practice them in the cts I you 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.750
 advise to read the article 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.110
 correspondent on my blog at very 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.710
 soon 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.710
 ciao
