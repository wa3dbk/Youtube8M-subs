00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
yeah the modern maker eventually wants

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.410 
yeah the modern maker eventually wants
to<00:03:45.280> make<00:03:45.460> it<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.640> little<00:03:45.760> bit<00:03:45.940> different<00:03:46.270> and<00:03:46.360> a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
to make it a little bit different and a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.210 
to make it a little bit different and a
little<00:03:46.600> more<00:03:46.750> realistic<00:03:46.990> because<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:48.100> know

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
little more realistic because you know

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.580 
little more realistic because you know
bison<00:03:48.700> don't<00:03:48.910> really<00:03:49.120> eat<00:03:49.330> wheat<00:03:49.630> cows<00:03:49.900> do<00:03:50.200> so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
bison don't really eat wheat cows do so

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.840 
bison don't really eat wheat cows do so
he<00:03:50.650> wants<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.980> make<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.459> they<00:03:51.550> can<00:03:51.700> go

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
he wants to make it so that they can go

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.610 
he wants to make it so that they can go
around<00:03:51.940> eating<00:03:52.360> for<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:52.900> grass<00:03:53.200> like<00:03:53.470> this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
around eating for like grass like this

around eating for like grass like this
and<00:03:53.830> also<00:03:54.010> double<00:03:54.730> tall<00:03:54.970> grass<00:03:55.209> like<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.480> on

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and also double tall grass like this on

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.180 
and also double tall grass like this on
the<00:03:55.930> ground<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.440> can<00:03:56.590> feed<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.040> them

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
the ground and you can feed it to them

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.500 
the ground and you can feed it to them
like<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.400> don't<00:03:57.550> think<00:03:57.700> right<00:03:57.850> now<00:03:58.000> yeah<00:03:58.420> you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510

like I don't think right now yeah you
can't<00:03:58.810> feed<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.320> them<00:03:59.470> but<00:03:59.680> eventually<00:03:59.920> he

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
can't feed it to them but eventually he

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.790 
can't feed it to them but eventually he
will<00:04:00.670> add<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.390> mod<00:04:01.600> so<00:04:02.290> yeah<00:04:02.440> when

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
when you do kill it you will just get

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.880 
when you do kill it you will just get
what<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.750> get<00:04:13.870> from<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:14.110> cow<00:04:14.260> it's<00:04:14.500> not<00:04:14.650> really

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
what you get from a cow it's not really

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.349 
what you get from a cow it's not really
anything<00:04:15.070> crazy<00:04:15.370> you'll<00:04:15.580> get<00:04:15.700> raw<00:04:15.880> beef<00:04:16.150> and

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
anything crazy you'll get raw beef and

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.940 
anything crazy you'll get raw beef and
leather<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.290> cool<00:04:17.470> thing<00:04:17.650> about<00:04:17.709> this

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
leather but the cool thing about this

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.039 
leather but the cool thing about this
mod<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.970> they're<00:04:19.150> eventually<00:04:19.330> going<00:04:19.840> to

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
mod is that they're eventually going to

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.659 
mod is that they're eventually going to
add<00:04:20.230> in<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:20.709> potions<00:04:20.980> I'm<00:04:21.310> pretty<00:04:21.489> sure

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
add in like potions I'm pretty sure

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.000 
add in like potions I'm pretty sure
where<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.900> get<00:04:23.080> custom<00:04:23.560> drafts<00:04:23.919> where

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
where you can get custom drafts where

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.110 
where you can get custom drafts where
you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.190> make<00:04:24.280> potions<00:04:24.460> or<00:04:24.700> strengthen

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you can make potions or strengthen

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.250 
you can make potions or strengthen
potions<00:04:25.390> or<00:04:25.480> resistance<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:25.960> stuff<00:04:26.110> like

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
potions or resistance and stuff like

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.630 
potions or resistance and stuff like
that<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.770> bison<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.250> know<00:04:27.340> are<00:04:27.460> really

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
that because bison you know are really

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.280 
that because bison you know are really
resistant<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.240> other<00:04:28.510> animals<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.110> stuff

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
resistant to other animals and stuff

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.110 
resistant to other animals and stuff
like<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.160> hopefully<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.880> will<00:04:30.970> be

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
like that so hopefully that will be

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.250 
like that so hopefully that will be
added<00:04:31.419> shortly<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.810> yeah<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.140> just

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
added shortly so yeah this is just

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.230 
added shortly so yeah this is just
pretty<00:04:32.650> much<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.890> work<00:04:33.100> in<00:04:33.220> progress<00:04:33.430> mod<00:04:33.760> that

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
pretty much a work in progress mod that

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.600 
pretty much a work in progress mod that
will<00:04:34.270> hopefully<00:04:34.750> add<00:04:35.320> some<00:04:36.070> new<00:04:36.160> things<00:04:36.400> in

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
will hopefully add some new things in

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.490 
will hopefully add some new things in
the<00:04:36.760> future<00:04:36.790> so<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.780> have<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> last<00:04:38.230> thing

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the future so you have the last thing

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.840 
the future so you have the last thing
that<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.710> want<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:38.980> show<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.190> guys<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.520> how<00:04:39.669> much

that I want to show you guys is how much

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.280 
that I want to show you guys is how much

damage they will actually do on you so
they<00:04:41.440> are<00:04:41.500> originally<00:04:41.980> passive<00:04:42.460> if<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.910> into

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
they are originally passive if I go into

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.909 
they are originally passive if I go into
a<00:04:43.210> game<00:04:43.540> with<00:04:43.570> survival<00:04:44.110> here<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:44.650> let's<00:04:44.800> see

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
a game with survival here so let's see

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.310 
a game with survival here so let's see
if<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.100> baby<00:04:45.280> will<00:04:45.430> fight<00:04:46.300> me<00:04:46.450> it<00:04:47.020> is<00:04:47.169> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
if the baby will fight me it is the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.980 
if the baby will fight me it is the
enemy<00:04:47.440> no<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> actually<00:04:48.669> do<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.210> fight<00:04:49.690> let's

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
enemy no I actually do they fight let's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.380 
enemy no I actually do they fight let's
see<00:04:50.200> there<00:04:50.950> they<00:04:51.100> are<00:04:51.250> they<00:04:51.400> fully<00:04:51.730> passive

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
see there they are they fully passive

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.810 
see there they are they fully passive
because<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.470> know<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:53.980> regular<00:04:54.190> bison<00:04:54.729> I

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
because I know that regular bison I

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.950 
because I know that regular bison I
think<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:55.210> they<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.479> let<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.720> off<00:04:55.810> you

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
think that they would let you off you

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.300 
think that they would let you off you
went<00:04:56.200> over<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.440> like<00:04:56.530> slap<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.950> Bison<00:04:57.250> I

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
went over and like slap the Bison I

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.260 
went over and like slap the Bison I
think<00:04:57.490> they<00:04:57.550> were<00:04:57.669> trying<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:57.940> hurt<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.150> but

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
think they were trying to hurt you but

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.490 
think they were trying to hurt you but
yeah<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:58.450> looks<00:04:58.630> like<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.050> full

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
yeah it looks like this is a full

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.560 
yeah it looks like this is a full
the<00:04:59.590> passive<00:05:00.400> mob<00:05:00.610> even<00:05:01.030> if<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.180> try<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.450> hit

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the passive mob even if you try and hit

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.090 
the passive mob even if you try and hit
it<00:05:01.690> it's<00:05:01.780> pretty<00:05:01.960> much<00:05:02.020> like<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.260> cow<00:05:02.440> but<00:05:02.950> it

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100
