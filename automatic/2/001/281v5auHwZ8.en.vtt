their<00:01:29.360> point<00:01:29.870> is<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.350> get<00:01:30.620> people<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.300> buy<00:01:32.300> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
pigs that are in danger so we and so

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.630 
pigs that are in danger so we and so
more<00:01:36.740> people<00:01:36.890> breed<00:01:37.250> them<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.490> they'll

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
more people breed them and they'll

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.100 
more people breed them and they'll
continue<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.120> species<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:38.930> another

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
continue the species so that's another

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.650 
continue the species so that's another
reason<00:01:39.350> why<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.620> like<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.830> do<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.330> by<00:01:41.330> creating

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
reason why we like to do it by creating

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
a market for the meal foot it

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.430 
a market for the meal foot it

provides interest for people to work to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.850 
provides interest for people to work to
