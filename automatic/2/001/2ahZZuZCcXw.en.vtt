 very not expensive, I was cheering for 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 more expensive was rooting for a zidane 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.600
 is rooting for a ronaldo phenomenon 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.019
 the guys who came over having to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 to be happy that these people come 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640

 legal maximums gattuso in my 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 cool zanetti has to be cool in this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 cool deco is cool guys the best it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 was a great player from england 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 only he is not from our time was not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.149
 so we do not have that much anymore 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.500
 deco love I do not think it's cool because it 's 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.520
 a short time ago he had 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.290
 fluminense 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.150
 The coolest I know I like guys 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.369
 was the cat's personal use was what I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.470
 I thought it was great to leave but I 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.600
 wanted a ronaldo phenomenon and very expensive 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.250
 I wish that who knows the rival for what 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.869
 surround back playing while he is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.270
 playing but he retired for a long time 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.189
 to have the rival and the coolest 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 now that all players will have 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.820
 chemical orange oranges that orange line 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.470
 when you boot up 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.210
 usually the only chemists had chemistry 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 with the legendary or with a player of the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 even of the same nationality now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.470
 Now any player you will be able to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.729
 keep the legendary team this is very good 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.170
 because usually the legendary were 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.340
 outside because of this chemistry thing 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 folks you could not use the legendary 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 in teams that were not with players of the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.130
 same nationality 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 the timing that was not entire reading 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.329
 now you can get your team 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.950
 should see your barclays team and bounce 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.079
 legendary in the middle is connected well 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.119
 intruder of course the two will get more 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.070
 still expensive maybe or maybe not yet 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.700
 Are you not sure about this but? 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.200
 It's really cool, this guys, so this was it. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.969
 basically people want to know about the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.290
 comments there the legendary you 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.299
 Do you think I missed it? 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.090
 which one do you like the most? 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.679
 and these then what do you think you 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.450
 which you would vote for in your team if 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.440
 you had the money to buy only one 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.000
 all right 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.530
 So that's it folks, let me tell you 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.790
