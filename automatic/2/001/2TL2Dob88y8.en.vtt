 We continue to study the mod called 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 towncraft 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 4 today we will do our most 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.740
 the first scroll a but for starters by studying 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.820
 some aspects like glass we don't 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.760
 we can learn Russian too iron too 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.189
 torch torch we can study with you 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 So go further the quartz block from 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.710
 required knowledge hell fence about studied 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 got a stone and 1 day 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.620
 about a whole block is power and 4 crystals 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.000
 you know we can study glass 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.300
 studied but some aspects we have not yet 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.140
 we can study at the expiration of time 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.789
 accordingly when we study 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 new inventions then we will of course 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.500
 learn new aspects and so for the length 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.159
 bars on nikon magical aspects 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 appeared and so is the suite air candle 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 plus fire a pistol cam just up 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.869
 village order plus fire and stone land 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.400
 on earth further all the main aspects of their 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.680
 principle can not how to do so today 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 we are not going to do something wrong such 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 thing like a torch in fact she 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.460
 can also devote 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.000
 and to learn something you just need to take 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.610
 some aspect 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.360
 press the green key for this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.229
 left so 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 per meter twitter study note 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.770
 the magical flame can further these 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 all the letters move as we want but take 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.200
 again the light here is an aspect that it is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.430
 for spect it is in principle alcohol which 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.380
 we need to remove the letters of the letter we 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.420
 got yourself connected 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.170
 from one point to another using this 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.780
 magical symbol of the ethical aspect 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.959
 In principle, this is the whole task of studying. 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.510
 scroll here's a scroll there we press 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.760
 right click and study it 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.160
 open our thaumonomicon this here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 alchemy that's not you of course he's him 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.530
 it is necessary to cook but everything is not so easy to cook 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.670
 I did not count on us today of course 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.670
 so quickly did it 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.480
 let's go with you and so for a start we 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.480
 need to make a boiler 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.640
 then a bucket of water and a bucket of lava to us 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.430
 and so will need to put all the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.799
 there is going to be a boiler or crucible here 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.269
 he is called the most beautiful thing about it 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.280
 ark what can you learn 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.390
 just the items you throw away 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.100
 for example on just studied bucket 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:19.510
 water in the fray you studied and we can study 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.690
 boiler ok so let's do our 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.870
 sigil 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:33.440
 suddenly we fill heads take any block on 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.220
 it and put over the lava boiler to the right 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 there 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.989
 right-click on the boiler at 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.989
 we got it now pour water there 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.530
 and now we look into the book means to 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.710
 cook 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.250
 not that we need three candles three forces 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.270
 and ancient and one encounter dust but 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:05.560
 See, the thing is, I know coal. 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:09.460
 which gives us two fires and two at once 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.710
 force accordingly if we throw here 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.810
 see your object see that is 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.150
 that we are not yet residents but this one 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.650
 highlighted gives two days and 2 power 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:26.530
 accordingly we will have to throw 3 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:29.890
 coal to get 2 liters but not all 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.890
 so just need 2 more candles more precisely 2 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.400
 luxury 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:39.210
 then we will need 6 times one 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.940
 if one candle gives 1 lux 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:47.230
 respectively for 26 years and coal 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.830
 accordingly, I will need well 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:56.919
 you understand me if you need a boiler 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.740
 three three aspects of fire three aspects of power and 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.680
 three aspects of luxury 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.820
 the torch gives 1 lux means it means you 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:11.220
 no torch but coal gives two flames and two 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.220
 forces, respectively, need to be taken 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:28.450
 Need to take 3 coal to get 666 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:31.320
 get and strength and fire up to 2 to 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:36.010
 get and two forces 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.760
 just 03 because with 22 multiply by 3 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.320
 there will be 6 so you need to take 3 coal to 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.370
 It turned out six power 6 fire and 6 candles and 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.860
 respectively, and if we ever want 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.669
 make two not hard you will need 22 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.080
 standing 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.729
 starting to climb 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.069
 first ask the torch throw the whole 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.520
 coal and 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.430
 throw back to meet no but 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.060
 so everything is simple and easy 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.639
 if the song is watching all this here 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.620
 above that is there and need to throw 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.590
 last of all that's all the logic 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.400
 simple and so let's check how 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.400
 our world works 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.210
 so you set forever can go out 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.210
 the street 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.020
 distinguish run
