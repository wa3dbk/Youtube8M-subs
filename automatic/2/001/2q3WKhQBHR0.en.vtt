00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.939
 Rodriguez from the chain cope wanted him 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.699
 ask if today he has used a system 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.160
 4-4-2 if with this system let's say you have 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.900
 found the balance that always 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.690
 you search for matches but well 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.540
 a greater balance with continuity in 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 the game controlling the game well 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.130
 reacting well after 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.070
 the goal conceded 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.980
 yes I think it is not the work system 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.290
 of all now 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 we show that the team is physically 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.750
 much better by comparing it 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.199
 to the match against athletic we are 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 getting better 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.299
 about this aspect because of this 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.869
 also the balance is easier to 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.869
 look for it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:21.350
 the world that has appeared the goal and 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.770
 what plans do you have for the insurance lawyer 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.980
 calmly 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 but everything 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.720
 Esparto defensive by 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.480
 the first two or three situations 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.170
 played well together but I have also 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.170
 had a lot of opportunity to stop 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.290
 work but it was quiet 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 hello hello mister antonio very radio 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.009
 national of Spain also important 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.409
 party of her I really imagine that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.399
 recover by trust over all the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.399
 game that you have in this player 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 I'm clearly very happy about why 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.069
 we are going to be shown to be ready is the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.140
 night 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.829
 showing great seriousness to the great 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.829
 professionalism 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.750
 player for this very important to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.220
 our team I do not know how many matches 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 to last as if by the way 7 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.130
 to a player who needs it when he needs it 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.130
 ready 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 At nightfall you take it Gonzalez-Martin de 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.130
 rbc said two days ago he was going to do 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.870
 hoyer that was going to do rotations for 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.730
 that people rest that the lateral 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 or what they wear the most for that reason 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.720
 changes always think about changing to keylor 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.040
 to put here and yesterday to half a disc 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.810
 every two or three parties so that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.130
 spend three weeks and play as you are going 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.880
 to raise the system 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.840
 at this moment in prayer is 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.260
 important because we have all 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 motivated 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.650
 we have many parties we have another 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.410
 party saves another another then I think 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.530
 which is normal at this time 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.600
 to surround a tester to avoid over 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.670
 every problem or has rested at 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.630
 Right Lane 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.260
 and they will advocate bran 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.890
 that is, when dedicating mails dikhipen 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.110
 they wanted to do a physical form 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.360
 spectacular we can say that it is the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 result of the break he had that he did not play 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.840
 in the against real society did not go with 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.480
 portugal had three weeks to work 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.240
 this is the direct result hit by 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.850
 be so over all this because you need 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.440
 I needed to do a work period 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.440
 he has done it with 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.430
 with a seriousness that he has with the 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.890
 old professional who has 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.030
 at that time physically it is very well 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.030
 he is very motivated 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.250
 what brand makes a lot 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.170
 Well, it's not the boss, as he said 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.550
 the rotations for against villarreal 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.900
 I wanted to ask him if the goal goes 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.760
 to follow that navas or will continue 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.840
 squares and he was going to use the same 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.840
 east system 442 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.250
 about the system something I said 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.530
 it's a long time that we try to defend 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.770
 with 4,442 and we try to stop in a 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.460
 different system to use it at 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.460
 better features 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.810
 of the players in front of the other and 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.010
 other 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.240
 and now we see we see it salty so 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.470
 we have the time to talk again 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.470
 of this topic 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.760
 good evening mister marianos have been 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.320
 3 television antenna precisely with 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.730
 this decision of change in the goal 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.610
 I do not think he has put iker back 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.650
 squares in the center of view of 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.950
 public 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.700
 do not 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.700
 I do not think so 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.450
 Carlos at night is Carlos Bianchi from 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.970
 Korea of ​​the Chinese one thing is tonight 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.580
 have you played with an average of players 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.090
 20 bordering the 24 years the oldest 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.340
 ronaldo of 20 and 29 that's a challenge that you 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.680
 fixed also for this season not 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.360
 have to worry ronald a little 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.229
 from this 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.300
 but we have young people with great quality 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.539
 we have to enjoy it this I think 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.969
 that last year they have contributed to the team 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.240
 much enthusiasm are doing the same 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:48.680
 what I want to distribute from the 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.460
 professionalism of these players who 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.740
 is not easy 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.930
 as I said do not play so much of being 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.930
 ready when the coach calls you 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.970
 this shows health in the template 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.639
 the template is healthy for this 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.900
 we ask the last two questions or the 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.780
 same as your left plays but not 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.160
 take ball point what you said 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.480
 that the rotation of the players is 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.370
 important to have them for all 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.710
 fresh in the case of the goal of 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.900
 squares how much in their decision they matter 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.900
 the bernabéu whistles thanks nothing 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.880
 last question will be that he arrived towers 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.580
 much debate has been going on in the country 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.400
 is a ronaldo Christian as a player if that 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.620
 yes it is a center forward or what is 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.190
 exactly he has said several times that 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.810
 he does not like to play on tip but what 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.210
 There is a difference between what you have done today 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.210
 Christian and what what a 9 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.740
 the difference is that she does not 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.910
 like to fly with your back to the goal 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.840
 so 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:04.650
 wants to find a space in band for 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.130
 always have the goal the goal 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.130
 in front 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.580
 the movements that you do you do it with 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.580
 a speed with a fast 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.720
 and this is why it is surprising 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.520
 on the border within the area of 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.520
 penalty is always liked because 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.990
 has a 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.740
 ease of movement only 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.740
 thank you very much
