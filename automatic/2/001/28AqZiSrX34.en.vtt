00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.620 
for dealing the aliens and that's to to
get<00:00:34.530> Will<00:00:34.710> Smith<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:36.149> we've<00:00:36.300> done<00:00:36.480> is

particular<00:01:36.270> project<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.990> found<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
particular project I found that what I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.780 
particular project I found that what I
needed<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.689> amount<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.280> 500%<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> could

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
needed was an amount of 500% if I could

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
needed was an amount of 500% if I could
go<00:01:41.939> higher<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:44.280> radius

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
go higher with that I would and a radius

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.319 
go higher with that I would and a radius
of<00:01:44.850> around<00:01:45.320> 6.6<00:01:46.320> percent<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.240> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
of around 6.6 percent and that really is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.850 
of around 6.6 percent and that really is
essential<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.869> getting<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.380> particular

essential for getting this particular

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.219 
essential for getting this particular
effect<00:01:50.130> work<00:01:50.479> next<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
effect work next what we do is that we

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.719 
effect work next what we do is that we

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
go to the filter gallery and there are

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.020 
go to the filter gallery and there are
three<00:01:57.469> filters<00:01:58.469> at<00:01:58.740> work<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.340> with<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.400 
folder choose half tone switch it on and
we<00:02:17.800> need<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.040> choose<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> line<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.570> size<00:02:20.080> I'm

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
we need to choose the line the size I'm

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.310 
we need to choose the line the size I'm
going<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> keep<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.420> contrast<00:02:23.110> is

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
going to keep it one the contrast is

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.800 
going to keep it one the contrast is
going<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.970> fairly<00:02:24.970> low<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.540> always

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
going to be fairly low we can always

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.980 
going to be fairly low we can always
alter<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.230> later<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.710> we'll<00:02:27.340> create<00:02:27.550> another

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
alter that later on we'll create another

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.480 
alter that later on we'll create another
filter<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.710> one<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
filter and this one is going to be the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.450 
filter and this one is going to be the
torn<00:02:30.790> edges<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:32.680> we<00:02:32.890> need<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.310> just

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
torn edges and here we need to just

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.880 
torn edges and here we need to just
alter<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> balance<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.600> get<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> nice<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.770> we

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
alter the balance so we get a nice so we

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.860 
alter the balance so we get a nice so we
get<00:02:36.070> quite<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.610> lot<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.030> textural<00:02:37.510> detail

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
get quite a lot of the textural detail

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050 
get quite a lot of the textural detail
coming<00:02:38.170> out<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.740> lot<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.370> horizontal<00:02:39.850> lines

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
coming out a lot of the horizontal lines

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.990 
coming out a lot of the horizontal lines
showing<00:02:40.570> through<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:42.070> contours<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.790> this

object<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.960> spacecraft<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
object of this spacecraft so the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.500 
object of this spacecraft so the
contrast<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.410> go<00:02:47.830> down<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.130> zero<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:49.090> one

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510

of the texture detail to come through
and<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.710> much<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.100> contour<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.150> defined

by these horizontal lines the final

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.020 
by these horizontal lines the final
filter<00:03:04.990> we<00:03:05.110> need<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.530> texture<00:03:05.920> filter<00:03:06.310> so

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
filter we need is the texture filter so

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.520 
filter we need is the texture filter so
create<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> new<00:03:07.780> filter<00:03:09.390> choose<00:03:10.390> texture<00:03:10.960> we

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
create a new filter choose texture we

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.280 
create a new filter choose texture we
need<00:03:11.680> sandstone<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:13.090> scaling<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:14.020> hundred

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
need sandstone a scaling of a hundred

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.250 
need sandstone a scaling of a hundred
percent<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.920> relief<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.700> be

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
percent and the relief is going to be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.690 
percent and the relief is going to be
two<00:03:17.260> or<00:03:17.440> three<00:03:17.500> percent<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.160> there<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.430> it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
two or three percent in there just it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.460 
two or three percent in there just it
just<00:03:18.730> gives<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.360> impression<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.959> fairly

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
just gives the impression of fairly

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.550 
just gives the impression of fairly
rough<00:03:20.980> thick<00:03:21.400> paper<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.840> going<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.110> hit<00:03:23.230> OK

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
rough thick paper I'm going to hit OK

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.660 
rough thick paper I'm going to hit OK
and<00:03:23.740> there<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.640> have<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.300> very<00:03:25.660> simple

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and there you have it it's very simple

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.610 
and there you have it it's very simple
very<00:03:27.670> easy<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.030> achieve<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.690> I'm<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.500> going

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
very easy to achieve and I'm just going

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.500 
very easy to achieve and I'm just going
to<00:03:29.709> demonstrate<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.370> how<00:03:30.670> important<00:03:31.240> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
to demonstrate to you how important the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.680 
to demonstrate to you how important the
smart<00:03:32.050> sharpen<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.770> if<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:33.850> switch<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.090> off<00:03:34.360> you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
smart sharpen is if we switch it off you

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.170 
smart sharpen is if we switch it off you
can<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.170> total<00:03:35.350> disaster<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.220> with

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
can see the total disaster but with

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.090 
can see the total disaster but with
small<00:03:37.480> sharpen<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.050> will<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.500> those<00:03:38.709> edges

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
small sharpen on will get those edges

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.850 
small sharpen on will get those edges
coming<00:03:39.340> out<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.940> yeah<00:03:40.870> that's<00:03:41.140> basically<00:03:41.260> it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
coming out and yeah that's basically it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.280 
coming out and yeah that's basically it
is<00:03:42.010> some<00:03:42.280> pretty<00:03:43.270> impressive<00:03:43.690> for<00:03:43.959> not<00:03:44.110> too

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
is some pretty impressive for not too

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.000 
is some pretty impressive for not too
much<00:03:44.320> work

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
much work

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.090 
much work
so<00:03:45.580> that's<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.690> comic<00:03:47.470> book<00:03:47.650> effect<00:03:47.770> in

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
so that's the comic book effect in

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.860 
so that's the comic book effect in
