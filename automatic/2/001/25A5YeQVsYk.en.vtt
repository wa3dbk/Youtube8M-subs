just<00:00:55.710> drilled<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.309> hole<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> top<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.629> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
just drilled a hole in the top of this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
just drilled a hole in the top of this
I'll<00:00:58.140> should<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.949> show<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
I'll should take this off and show you I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.700 
I'll should take this off and show you I
just<00:01:00.090> drilled<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.629> hole<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.340> bottom<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
just drilled a hole in the bottom of the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.580 
just drilled a hole in the bottom of the
shock<00:01:04.949> mount<00:01:05.570> it's<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.409> bit

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
shock mount it's just like a little bit

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.170 
shock mount it's just like a little bit
smaller<00:01:07.830> than<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.159> quarter<00:01:08.490> inch<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
smaller than a quarter inch so it just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500 
smaller than a quarter inch so it just
kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> threads<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.330> then<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
kind of threads in there and then you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
kind of threads in there and then you
can<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.210> hole<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
can see that that's the hole that we

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.120 
can see that that's the hole that we
drilled<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> bottom<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> took<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
drilled in the bottom so then I took the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
drilled in the bottom so then I took the
arm<00:01:20.369> off<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.880> sm3<00:01:21.450> shock<00:01:21.869> mount<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
arm off of this sm3 shock mount that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
arm off of this sm3 shock mount that
holds<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.189> shotgun<00:01:23.580> microphone<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.290> then<00:01:25.290> now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
holds my shotgun microphone and then now

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
holds my shotgun microphone and then now
that<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.920> attaches<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.000> like

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that just attaches right on there like

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
that just attaches right on there like
that<00:01:27.210> pretty<00:01:27.630> nice<00:01:27.930> i'm<00:01:28.500> probably<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that pretty nice i'm probably going to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
that pretty nice i'm probably going to
do<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.549> I'm<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.570> bit

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
do is I'm going to make it a little bit

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.910 
do is I'm going to make it a little bit
bigger<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> step<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bigger I'm going to step it up and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.170 
bigger I'm going to step it up and
thread<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> 38<00:01:34.020> fitting<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.850> it'll<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
thread it to a 38 fitting so it'll just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
thread it to a 38 fitting so it'll just
be<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.750> bit<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.079> snug<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.740> I'd

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
be a little bit more snug on there I'd

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.990 
be a little bit more snug on there I'd
hate<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.610> hundred<00:01:38.880> dollar

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
hate for my two hundred dollar

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.749 
hate for my two hundred dollar
microphone<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.170> falling<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
microphone to go falling off there but

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.510 
microphone to go falling off there but
it<00:01:41.970> seems<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.540> fairly<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:44.009> connected

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it seems like it's fairly well connected

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
it seems like it's fairly well connected
and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> allows<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.439> plug<00:01:46.890> my

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and then this allows me to plug my

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
and then this allows me to plug my
