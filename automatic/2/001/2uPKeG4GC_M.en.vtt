00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
this thing which I use for linguine or

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.120 
this thing which I use for linguine or
spaghetti<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:23.170> measure<00:03:23.380> one<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.799> those<00:03:23.920> two

spaghetti to measure one of those two

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.770 
spaghetti to measure one of those two
days<00:03:24.250> three<00:03:24.459> days<00:03:24.519> or<00:03:24.790> four<00:03:24.820> doses<00:03:25.209> that's

pretty accurate

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.280 
pretty accurate
and<00:03:26.890> then<00:03:27.310> actually<00:03:27.910> as<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.060> turns<00:03:28.120> out<00:03:28.450> it's

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
and then actually as it turns out it's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.530 
and then actually as it turns out it's
very<00:03:29.350> similar<00:03:29.829> with<00:03:29.950> dry<00:03:30.220> passer-by<00:03:30.489> wait<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
could just do 100 Oh grams 200 grams 300

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.890 
could just do 100 Oh grams 200 grams 300
