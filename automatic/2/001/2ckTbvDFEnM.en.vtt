with that you know i don't even know how

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.400 
with that you know i don't even know how
to<00:03:42.640> explain<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.030> but<00:03:43.240> let's<00:03:43.750> just<00:03:43.840> say<00:03:44.020> it's<00:03:44.320> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
to explain it but let's just say it's a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.200 
to explain it but let's just say it's a
standard<00:03:44.800> wal-mart<00:03:45.640> mike<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.090> would

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
standard wal-mart mike that you would

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.750 
standard wal-mart mike that you would
get<00:03:46.390> anywhere<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.830> not<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.280> big<00:03:48.730> thing

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
get anywhere and it's not a big thing

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.410 
get anywhere and it's not a big thing
it's<00:03:49.390> not<00:03:49.480> special<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.770> you<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.280> guess<00:03:52.180> it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
it's not special but you I guess it's

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's not special but you I guess it's
you<00:03:52.540> know<00:03:52.690> for<00:03:53.290> those<00:03:53.380> people<00:03:53.710> that<00:03:53.740> don't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
you know for those people that don't

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.320 
you know for those people that don't
have<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.190> lot<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.400> money<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.850> just<00:03:54.940> want<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.210> get

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
have a lot of money and just want to get

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.090 
have a lot of money and just want to get
straight<00:03:55.540> into<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.840> gaming<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
straight into the gaming so the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.740 
straight into the gaming so the
different<00:03:57.730> thing<00:03:57.850> about<00:03:58.060> this<00:03:58.210> is<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.390> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
different thing about this is that the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.350 
different thing about this is that the
actual<00:03:58.930> port<00:03:59.560> is<00:04:00.160> completely<00:04:00.910> different<00:04:01.270> it's

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
actual port is completely different it's

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.450 
actual port is completely different it's
like<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> USB<00:04:02.200> sort<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.280> gotta

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
like a USB sort of and you gotta

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.800 
like a USB sort of and you gotta
you<00:04:03.670> know<00:04:03.700> just<00:04:03.970> show<00:04:04.210> that<00:04:04.240> into<00:04:04.660> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
you know just show that into the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.020 
you know just show that into the
controller<00:04:05.710> as<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.070> was<00:04:06.190> before<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.790> no

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
controller as it was before it's no

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.710 
controller as it was before it's no
longer<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:08.410> know<00:04:08.530> mp3<00:04:09.310> sort<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.850> jack<00:04:10.420> thing

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
longer a you know mp3 sort of jack thing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.230 
longer a you know mp3 sort of jack thing
now<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:11.140> like<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.320> USB<00:04:11.890> thing<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.340> moving<00:04:13.090> on

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
now it's like a USB thing so moving on

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.110 
now it's like a USB thing so moving on
here<00:04:13.990> are<00:04:14.290> more<00:04:14.650> cables<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.370> actually<00:04:15.820> go

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
here are more cables that actually go

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.910 
here are more cables that actually go
like<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:16.660> cable<00:04:17.020> right<00:04:17.109> here<00:04:17.140> actually<00:04:17.500> goes

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
like this cable right here actually goes

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.560 
like this cable right here actually goes
into<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.549> power<00:04:19.359> brick<00:04:19.660> itself<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.770> yeah

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
into the power brick itself and yeah

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.760 
into the power brick itself and yeah
sadly<00:04:22.770> Microsoft<00:04:23.770> has<00:04:23.919> decided<00:04:24.910> to

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
sadly Microsoft has decided to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.129 
sadly Microsoft has decided to
a<00:04:25.949> power<00:04:26.190> brick<00:04:26.550> even<00:04:27.090> though<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.569> xbox<00:04:27.990> one

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
a power brick even though the xbox one

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.040 
a power brick even though the xbox one
is<00:04:28.259> massive<00:04:28.860> they<00:04:29.490> still<00:04:29.940> want<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.629> make<00:04:30.810> add

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
is massive they still want to make add

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.570 
is massive they still want to make add
to<00:04:31.379> that<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:31.680> know<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.039> just<00:04:32.069> have<00:04:32.370> that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
to that you know and just have that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.339 
to that you know and just have that
power<00:04:32.759> brick<00:04:33.060> right<00:04:33.240> there<00:04:33.479> it's<00:04:34.020> really

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
power brick right there it's really

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.649 
power brick right there it's really
annoying<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.039> I<00:04:35.220> guess<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:36.090> have<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.300> put<00:04:36.629> up

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
annoying but I guess we have to put up

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.649 
annoying but I guess we have to put up
to<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:36.960> or<00:04:37.259> put<00:04:37.770> up<00:04:37.889> with<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.190> as<00:04:38.659> Microsoft

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
to it or put up with it as Microsoft

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.469 
to it or put up with it as Microsoft
consumers<00:04:40.349> so<00:04:40.759> right<00:04:41.759> here<00:04:41.909> I'm<00:04:42.000> just<00:04:42.060> open<00:04:42.449> it

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
consumers so right here I'm just open it

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.129 
consumers so right here I'm just open it
up<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.680> actually<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:44.610> know<00:04:44.849> it's<00:04:45.659> it's

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
up and it's actually you know it's it's

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.980 
up and it's actually you know it's it's
a<00:04:46.229> brick<00:04:46.590> I<00:04:46.800> don't<00:04:47.039> expect<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.210> do<00:04:48.720> much

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
a brick I don't expect it to do much

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.950 
a brick I don't expect it to do much
other<00:04:49.349> than<00:04:49.949> power<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.550> console<00:04:51.060> but<00:04:51.569> it

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
other than power the console but it

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.170 
other than power the console but it
actually<00:04:52.259> looks<00:04:52.710> pretty<00:04:52.919> cool<00:04:53.250> if<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.580> ask<00:04:53.789> me

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
actually looks pretty cool if you ask me

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.420 
actually looks pretty cool if you ask me
it's<00:04:54.449> it's<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.139> break<00:04:55.470> but<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.069> brick<00:04:56.280> and

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
it's it's a break but it's a brick and

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.390 
it's it's a break but it's a brick and
style<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.060> now<00:04:57.629> moving<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:58.139> we've<00:04:58.770> got<00:04:59.159> the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
style so now moving on we've got the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.730 
style so now moving on we've got the
hdmi<00:04:59.819> cable<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:00.659> finally<00:05:01.319> you<00:05:01.440> know<00:05:01.560> that's

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
hdmi cable that finally you know that's

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.890 
hdmi cable that finally you know that's
actually<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> plus<00:05:02.849> for<00:05:03.150> Microsoft<00:05:03.720> and

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
actually a plus for Microsoft and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.809 
actually a plus for Microsoft and
actually<00:05:04.229> actually<00:05:04.770> put<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.370> there<00:05:05.550> and

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
actually actually put that in there and

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.110 
actually actually put that in there and
