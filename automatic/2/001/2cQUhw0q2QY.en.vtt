00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.489
 I really like the killer whale 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.390
 also super big 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.190
 if they are not equal they are not can not 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.350
 they are the same if they are dying here 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.440
 all can not be 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.040
 I'm going to throw again in the aorta that are 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 equal to the star I'm not rolling 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.560
 so good to say that the whale and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.390
 the orca are the same and not because not now 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.829
 now the whale has taken out yes sir 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.379
 it's the whale that is moving here 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.810
 because it has no water it is good to teach 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:48.900
 also the crabs look 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:52.879

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.879
 crabs really cool 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.570
 and here we have clams that will not let me 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.650
 Do not look at them either, there are the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:05.310
 clams to this one 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.590
 and well, here are more things 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.239
 that you can see yourselves 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.950
 interesting the mod you know you can 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.220
 download it in the video description 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.680
 as always and they continue to see us I think 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.570
 there were more animals to show you to see 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.820
 Salmon is already catching the shark 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.240
 good is this for example I'm not going to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.979
 remove the animals to see we are going to 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.530
 try rich first we are not going to see yo os 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.060
 it's pretty big 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.470
 hi hello sir crab 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.590
 I love how you will see me 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.430
 let's try 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.430
 the blanket 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.320
 there it is, it's like what we've seen 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.320
 beginning era is very pretty 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 and we are left with this that I do not know what it is 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.889
 the snorkel 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.819
 it does not let me taste the good 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.280
 we have tested this for example 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.090
 it looks a lot like salmon they are almost the same 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.190
 only that of different color 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.080
 it's an honor to see this this is a 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.780
 shell I think and this I think is a 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.880
 shell 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.520
 this we have shot the flippers that 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.550
 neither good only have some 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.160
 function but I do not know which salmon the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.750
 horta we have already tried the mantua I them 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.950
 I think we have tried everything and because 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.770
 are disappearing humans are 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.639
 dying clear good because I think we have 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.800
 tested all the marine animals that 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.990
 almost all of them come and well, as 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.900
 you have seen bring many more 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.639
 objects that you can see yourselves 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.680
 you are interested in the mod downloading it in the 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.480
 description as always and good what 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.070
