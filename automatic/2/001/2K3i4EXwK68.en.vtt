though<00:02:31.970> when<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.630> all<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.940> improve

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
though when you do all of that improve

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.729 
though when you do all of that improve
the<00:02:35.060> drivability<00:02:35.690> improve<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> feel<00:02:36.470> it

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the drivability improve the feel it

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.350 
the drivability improve the feel it
allows<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.430> driver<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.790> drive<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> car

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
allows the driver to drive the car

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.390 
allows the driver to drive the car
faster<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.049> even<00:02:39.620> without<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.040> increase<00:02:40.370> of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
faster so even without the increase of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.970 
faster so even without the increase of
power<00:02:40.730> because<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> faster<00:02:41.989> car<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.799> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
power because a faster car with the

power because a faster car with the
increase<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.310> torque<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.790> power<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.660> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
increase of torque and power it's a much

increase of torque and power it's a much
faster<00:02:45.080> car<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.180> inevitably<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:48.010> find

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
faster car so inevitably we just find

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.490 
faster car so inevitably we just find
performance<00:02:49.670> comes<00:02:50.239> as<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> natural<00:02:51.380> byproduct

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
performance comes as a natural byproduct

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.940 
performance comes as a natural byproduct
of<00:02:52.070> what<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.549> every<00:02:52.790> day
