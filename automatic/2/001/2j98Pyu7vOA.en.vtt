00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and if you beat the game then we don't

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
and if you beat the game then we don't
know<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.770> short<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.330> i'd<00:01:09.330> say<00:01:09.570> anything

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
know if it's short but i'd say anything

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
know if it's short but i'd say anything
under<00:01:10.320> 10<00:01:10.530> hours<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.159> short<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.930> say

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
under 10 hours is pretty short so say

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
under 10 hours is pretty short so say
right<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.320> 10<00:01:13.619> seems<00:01:14.130> good<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> game

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
right around 10 seems good for a game

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
right around 10 seems good for a game
like<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:16.170> opinion<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> game<00:01:17.040> being

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
like this now my opinion on a game being

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
like this now my opinion on a game being
on<00:01:17.400> Rails<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.680> design<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.250> game

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
on Rails is if they design this game

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
on Rails is if they design this game
with<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.689> mind<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.259> game<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
with that in mind that this game is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
with that in mind that this game is
going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.799> extremely<00:01:22.979> linear<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.970> don't

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
going to be extremely linear I don't

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.609 
going to be extremely linear I don't
really<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> could<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> knock<00:01:25.439> on

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
really think that could be a knock on

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.289 
really think that could be a knock on
the<00:01:25.650> game<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.700> really<00:01:27.030> made<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the game because it's not really made to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.050 
the game because it's not really made to
be<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.750> exploration<00:01:28.170> game<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:29.060> free-roaming

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
be an exploration game or free-roaming

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.780 
be an exploration game or free-roaming
game<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.659> made<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.680> through<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.549> game

in<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.930> certain<00:01:34.200> way<00:01:34.380> why<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:36.180> probably<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
in a certain way why I think probably to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.149 
in a certain way why I think probably to
tell<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> story<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> keep<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tell the story if you want to keep a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
tell the story if you want to keep a
story<00:01:38.490> tight<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.030> don't<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.420> too<00:01:39.630> much

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
story tight you don't want too much

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.219 
story tight you don't want too much
freedom<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.210> characters<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:43.079> then

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
freedom of the characters because then

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
freedom of the characters because then
that<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> takes<00:01:43.829> away<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.280> story<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that kind of takes away from a story you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.700 
that kind of takes away from a story you
want<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> keep<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.540> tight<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> concise<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
want to keep it tight and concise and I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.319 
want to keep it tight and concise and I
think<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.159> probably<00:01:47.430> why<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.820> game<00:01:48.090> might

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
think that's probably why the game might

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.020 
think that's probably why the game might
be<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.720> short<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.380> once<00:01:50.070> again<00:01:50.579> starts

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
be a little short to once again starts

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
be a little short to once again starts
getting<00:01:51.270> too<00:01:51.360> long<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.899> story<00:01:52.140> starts<00:01:52.500> having

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
getting too long the story starts having

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460 
getting too long the story starts having
holds<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.280> falling<00:01:53.579> apart<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.170> actually<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
holds and falling apart and actually you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
holds and falling apart and actually you
don't<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.130> loses<00:01:56.399> your<00:01:56.640> interest<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
don't it loses your interest so if you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.240 
don't it loses your interest so if you
want<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> keep<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> tight<00:01:58.380> story<00:01:58.710> almost<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
want to keep a tight story almost like a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
want to keep a tight story almost like a
movie<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.149> got<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> keep<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.899> short

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
movie you got to keep it pretty short

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740 
movie you got to keep it pretty short

story walking dead like the strange and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.290 
to and I have high hopes for it but I
actually<00:03:03.290> think<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.280> game<00:03:04.490> holds

actually think this is this game holds

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.510 
actually think this is this game holds
the<00:03:05.510> highest<00:03:05.720> chance<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:07.220> letting

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
the highest chance of just letting

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.720 
the highest chance of just letting
