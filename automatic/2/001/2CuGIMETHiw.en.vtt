 Here is a little water coffee maker continues , but there was something I wanted 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.090
 I tried to buy it Starbucks coffee and fluffy Tachiris coffee in above

 It will be a mixer that makes a little of that Usually, Mr. Starbucks or Mr. Arazu 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 Simmered milk and milk 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 Place in steam against lather and load fluffy and put on coffee 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 This because it is of course not without the above is a burden home but I got to say and make a latte 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.310
 Over immediately tea was off at a little win I think if Ikere be substituted with what went 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:04.210
 The day of the coffee at the maker leaving the maker 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:13.480
 Well, it's the only manufacturer that is hydraulic and a well-known manufacturer. 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:15.400
 I Tata expression is pathetic Te date 3 years is the type is I waste glass that 45 of cqt and 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.970
 Something like this 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.970
 I also know this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.060
 It is 2 to say that quite a Big Penis Yeah yeah against it but is Boo Boo 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:37.070
 In It is what from on this and this right Sa' 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:43.720
 Kisa itself is such a day and sister a little distant view finish 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:47.370
 It is a stool super-carbonate Japan that we will put that I think the battery and want to put the connection a little battery 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.880

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.880
 4 ka 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:00.880
 It is early, but there is also a worry about whether there is no door 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:08.119
 Well then it's a bit quick How do you make a lapel It looks like it's tough to see here 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.960
 There is a line called milk, but even if it is 100ml 100 c 0 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.940
 If you put it in the microwave 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:21.420
 50 to 60 seconds at 500 at 40 to 50 seconds at 600 at 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:26.580
 It's about heating 30 to 40 seconds at 700 watts. In the case of ice, a microwave oven 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.950
 It 's supposed to froth the chilled milk from one to the other without warming it up. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.240
 Just put a day and milk in a little while 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.480
 It has masu filet 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.460
 Precautions do is Kedomo of when are millet 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:46.070
 It's about putting this firmly on this edge, so it 's in the form of a book 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.600
 It's hard to me as it is difficult, so I'll make a slight angle Switch on for 30 seconds 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.600
 It seems to be a switch 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.710
 It is such a mon 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 Well, I 'll pull this a little 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.730
 It's cold milk, so I think it's not so bubbling though 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.210
 Mathematics 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.110
 Hmm 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.110
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 Hmm 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 Hmm 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.850
 How about that 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.800
 Well how calm or not 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.760

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.819
 Understood 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.819
 Hmm 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.060
 Steel continues calm 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.060
 I'm immature but not at all 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:05.310
 A little trouble occurred I just read the instruction manual The frothing of the refrigerator is bubbling 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.320
 It is difficult 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:13.200
 From 0 minutes i need a power shield and I thought it was impossible for a while 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.380
 So I've given you so I'm going to go here 30 is here 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.380
 now 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.510
 Is this something like this 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.110
 In in 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.110
 Ump 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.490
 More ahead was big , but it became like this 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:40.860
 A little earlier in that there is better was often about 60 seconds from the time being is it 30 seconds 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.949
 There was a story of troubles, but what was in the refrigerator was interpreted as like chilled milk 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.200
 It has entered into this Cabinet Order island Kedomo is 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:52.810
 Milk is about 10 degrees around this mixer 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:59.470
 Door of what to do with the fact that a milk was cooled to about from a time that is suitable whisk 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:19.490
 It it is've got I'd it is written Fu that good and cool the milk in view ice 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:24.139
 0's it it or Atget 10 minutes here rider bran 4 next to talk about such a thing 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:28.090
 Air temperature stands is now expected to be of 60 from $ 40 degrees 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.090
 I feel so bubbling like this 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.200
 In it this is the 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.800
 In this way 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.449
 In making you blue is young I like this 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.029
 Hmm 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.029
 This is going to be a bit crooked because I'm a married couple 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.400
 In here 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.400
 me 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.300
 tomtom thumbtack 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.840
 Whether do not you write a rice 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.590
 At first it is first of all to be an amateur 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.590
 I say 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.110
 Now what kind of body can you write 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.390
 Can not write 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.220
 It was possible 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.390
 It was possible 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.139
 It is latte art 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.240
 That's amazing 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.070
 I do not think that I went for the first time 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.630
 Hmm 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:35.610
 How was it? What is the layer tower consideration ? 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.300
 It does not say what because it does not try only So the result to it hot is so far 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.880
 But 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:44.710
 It was easy if you were a husband 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:50.830
 It's just that it gets cold, so it's no good with a refrigerator game, so a little 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:55.330
 A little painful when problems are thinking of Naa and so ice or in the subject 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:00.110
 It is that very well go and hopes to de cot 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:08.180
