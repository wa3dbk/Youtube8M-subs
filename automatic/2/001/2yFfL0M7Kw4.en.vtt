hi this is Jim mclennan of tennis 1.com
with<00:00:03.720> some<00:00:03.870> thoughts<00:00:04.080> about<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.529> volley

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
with some thoughts about the volley

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.700 
with some thoughts about the volley
wimbledon's<00:00:05.609> around<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:05.970> corner<00:00:06.350> we<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.500> see

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
wimbledon's around the corner we do see

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.730 
wimbledon's around the corner we do see
some<00:00:07.980> net<00:00:08.280> play<00:00:08.550> there<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.750> man<00:00:09.960> fed<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> hope

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
some net play there my man fed I hope

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
some net play there my man fed I hope
will<00:00:11.010> reassert<00:00:11.759> his<00:00:12.570> willingness<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.200> come

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
will reassert his willingness to come

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.589 
will reassert his willingness to come
forward<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:14.700> there's<00:00:14.880> some<00:00:15.059> nuances

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
forward but I think there's some nuances

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.840 
forward but I think there's some nuances
of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> volley<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:17.279> share<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of the volley that I can share with you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.150 
of the volley that I can share with you
that<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.869> box

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
that are a little bit out of the box

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
that are a little bit out of the box
it's<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.340> whether<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.910> volley<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> punch

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it's about whether the volley is a punch

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.230 
it's about whether the volley is a punch
or<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> stroke<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:23.310> about<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.910> how<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
or a stroke it's about really how the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
or a stroke it's about really how the
continental<00:00:24.840> grip<00:00:25.019> feels<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
continental grip feels and it's about an

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
continental grip feels and it's about an
idea<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> learn<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> practice

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
idea that if you learn and practice

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.589 
idea that if you learn and practice
volleying<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.070> midcourt<00:00:29.369> i'm<00:00:29.910> standing<00:00:30.359> in

volleying from midcourt i'm standing in

volleying from midcourt i'm standing in
no<00:00:30.750> man's<00:00:30.990> land<00:00:31.109> there's<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.669> number

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
no man's land there's actually a number

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.959 
no man's land there's actually a number
of<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:34.290> benefits<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.550> helped<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
of very good benefits that helped a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.190 
of very good benefits that helped a
stroke<00:00:36.360> stay<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.469> me<00:00:37.530> I'll<00:00:37.770> show<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.070> more

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
stroke stay with me I'll show you more

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.660 
stroke stay with me I'll show you more
so<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.350> still<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> no<00:00:40.829> man's<00:00:41.070> land<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.520> I'd

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so I'm still in no man's land and I'd

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
so I'm still in no man's land and I'd
like<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> show<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.329> nuance<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> grip

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
like to show you a nuance of the grip

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.580 
like to show you a nuance of the grip
and<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.280> racquet<00:00:44.670> head<00:00:44.820> too<00:00:45.809> often<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.320> think

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and the racquet head too often I think

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
and the racquet head too often I think
Valle<00:00:46.800> ears<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> racket<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.270> high<00:00:48.510> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
Valle ears have the racket very high in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
Valle ears have the racket very high in
their<00:00:48.809> hand<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.890> suspect<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.550> because

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
their hand and I suspect that's because

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.549 
their hand and I suspect that's because
they're<00:00:51.120> trained<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> volley<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.110> close<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
they're trained to volley so close to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
they're trained to volley so close to
the<00:00:52.680> net<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.879> give<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.270> down<00:00:54.480> they

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the net that they give it it down they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
the net that they give it it down they
can<00:00:54.989> succeed<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.030> me<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
can succeed at it but really for me to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.290 
can succeed at it but really for me to
get<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.539> length<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> volley<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.309> need

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
get any length on a volley now I need

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
get any length on a volley now I need
the<00:01:00.420> racket<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.140> away<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:02.010> arm<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the racket more away from my arm in this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.660 
the racket more away from my arm in this
alignment<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> volley<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:05.430> look

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
alignment so that the volley would look

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390 
alignment so that the volley would look
more<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.140> barring<00:01:07.890> from<00:01:08.130> Tom

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
more like that and barring from Tom

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.359 
more like that and barring from Tom
Stowe<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:09.090> called<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> volley<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> stroke<00:01:10.380> not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
Stowe he called this volley a stroke not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.870 
Stowe he called this volley a stroke not
a<00:01:11.400> long<00:01:11.729> stroke<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> stroke<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.880> it

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
a long stroke but it was a stroke and it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.870 
a long stroke but it was a stroke and it
feels<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> nuance<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
feels to me that the nuance here is not

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
feels to me that the nuance here is not
open<00:01:18.299> face<00:01:18.570> chop<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> open<00:01:21.210> face<00:01:22.159> drive<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
open face chop but open face drive and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.690 
open face chop but open face drive and
I'll<00:01:23.880> demonstrate<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> moment<00:01:25.170> but

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'll demonstrate in just a moment but

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.190 
I'll demonstrate in just a moment but
really<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.850> encouraging<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> figure<00:01:28.080> out

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
really I'm encouraging you to figure out

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.350 
really I'm encouraging you to figure out
how<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> start<00:01:28.799> volleying<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.670> no<00:01:30.090> man's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
how to start volleying from no man's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.620 
how to start volleying from no man's
land<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> handle<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.700> stroking<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
land to get a handle on stroking a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
land to get a handle on stroking a
volley<00:01:33.869> rather<00:01:34.680> than<00:01:34.829> punching<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
volley rather than punching it and get a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
volley rather than punching it and get a
handle<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.390> hitting<00:01:36.780> through<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> volley

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
handle on hitting through a volley

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
handle on hitting through a volley
rather<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> watch<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
rather than down at it and watch this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
rather than down at it and watch this
picture<00:01:42.240> again<00:01:42.540> I'll<00:01:43.140> show<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> same

face open with a continental grip but
the<00:01:48.659> head<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.829> sort<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:52.250> really

the head is up but sort of up not really
up<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.640> somehow<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> misinterpretation

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
up this somehow is the misinterpretation

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.090 
up this somehow is the misinterpretation

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.300 
step on a bug and slap your foot on the
ground<00:02:39.689> but<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.469> doing<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.829> opposite

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
ground but I'm really doing the opposite

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.879 
ground but I'm really doing the opposite
today<00:02:42.019> opposite<00:02:43.019> teaching<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.709> is

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
today opposite teaching and that is

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.379 
today opposite teaching and that is
stroke<00:02:44.609> diwali<00:02:45.169> mid-stride<00:02:47.180> stroke<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
stroke diwali mid-stride stroke the

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.429 
stroke diwali mid-stride stroke the
volley<00:02:49.639> mid-stride<00:02:50.639> now<00:02:51.329> let's<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.139> if<00:02:52.230> my

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
volley mid-stride now let's see if my

00:02:52.439 --> 00:03:14.630 
volley mid-stride now let's see if my
actions<00:02:52.650> match<00:02:53.220> my<00:02:53.609> words

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.830 

so<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.760> you're<00:03:15.880> familiar<00:03:16.150> with<00:03:16.420> some<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.720> my

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
so if you're familiar with some of my

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.090 
so if you're familiar with some of my
work<00:03:17.140> I'm<00:03:17.620> often<00:03:17.920> outside<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.550> box<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
work I'm often outside the box and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.650 
work I'm often outside the box and
perhaps<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.640> more<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.030> today<00:03:22.240> I

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
perhaps this is more of that today I

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.870 
perhaps this is more of that today I
really<00:03:23.440> encourage<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.190> experiment<00:03:24.580> with

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
really encourage you to experiment with

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.660 
really encourage you to experiment with
using<00:03:25.180> midcourt<00:03:25.870> backcourt<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> way<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.400> try

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
using midcourt backcourt as a way to try

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.970 
using midcourt backcourt as a way to try
to<00:03:27.700> hone<00:03:28.120> an<00:03:28.920> open-faced<00:03:29.920> stroke<00:03:30.610> volley<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
to hone an open-faced stroke volley it

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
to hone an open-faced stroke volley it
becomes<00:03:33.370> an<00:03:33.550> approach<00:03:33.880> shot<00:03:34.230> it's<00:03:35.230> about

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
becomes an approach shot it's about

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.040 
becomes an approach shot it's about
moving<00:03:35.740> forward<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.600> also<00:03:37.780> about

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
moving forward but it's also about

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.230 
moving forward but it's also about
getting<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.620> feeling<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.250> how<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.790> use<00:03:40.030> the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
getting a feeling of how to use the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.960 
getting a feeling of how to use the
racket<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.410> length<00:03:41.740> on<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> volley<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.850> I

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
racket to get length on a volley and I

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.580 
racket to get length on a volley and I
think<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.270> you're<00:03:43.420> willing<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> try<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.110> and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
think if you're willing to try this and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
think if you're willing to try this and
make<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> commitment<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:48.370> gain<00:03:48.580> a

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
make a commitment to it you gain a

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.610 
make a commitment to it you gain a
greater<00:03:48.910> appreciation<00:03:49.090> both<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.230> skill

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
greater appreciation both of this skill

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.350 
greater appreciation both of this skill
and<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.010> what<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.340> see<00:03:51.580> when<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.880> pros<00:03:52.150> are

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
and of what you see when the pros are

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.210 
and of what you see when the pros are
coming<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.840> because<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.380> first<00:03:53.620> volley<00:03:53.920> is

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
coming in because the first volley is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.610 
coming in because the first volley is
often<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.480> vicinity<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.989> no<00:03:56.230> man's<00:03:56.500> land

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
often in the vicinity of no man's land

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.380 
often in the vicinity of no man's land
certainly<00:03:57.190> was<00:03:57.340> with<00:03:57.520> Pete<00:03:57.700> Sampras<00:03:58.120> and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
certainly was with Pete Sampras and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.270 
certainly was with Pete Sampras and
there's<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.290> time<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.680> want<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.890> length<00:04:00.070> on<00:04:00.250> a

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
there's a time you want a length on a

there's a time you want a length on a
