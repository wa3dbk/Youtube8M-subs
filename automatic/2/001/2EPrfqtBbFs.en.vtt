00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
such as but in Leeds it don't seem to be

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
such as but in Leeds it don't seem to be
the<00:01:08.040> don't<00:01:08.250> seem<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> favor<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the don't seem to favor it really so I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
the don't seem to favor it really so I
think<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.220> might<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> major<00:01:11.760> factor<00:01:12.000> yeah

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
think that might be a major factor yeah

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
think that might be a major factor yeah
there's<00:01:12.750> definitely<00:01:12.810> talent<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.159> are

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
there's definitely talent where we are

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
there's definitely talent where we are
there's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.180> decent<00:01:15.509> amateurs<00:01:15.840> who<00:01:15.960> have

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
there's a some decent amateurs who have

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
there's a some decent amateurs who have
come<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.530> Leeds<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:17.759> doing<00:01:17.909> big<00:01:18.150> things

there's I think there's a lot of ongoing

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
there's I think there's a lot of ongoing
sort<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> looking<00:01:21.090> towards<00:01:21.360> aiming<00:01:22.350> for

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
Olympic squad in 2012 but the potential

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
Olympic squad in 2012 but the potential
is<00:01:25.770> definitely<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is definitely there there's just the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.700 
is definitely there there's just the
silliest<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.170> such<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> big<00:01:28.560> city

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.380 
authorities a lot of other cities and
towns<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.200> got<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:48.630> since<00:01:49.110> its

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
towns have got and I think since its

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.160 
towns have got and I think since its
demise<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> school<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.920> curriculum<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.170> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
demise of school not curriculum but just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.359 
demise of school not curriculum but just
seems<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> me<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> nobody's<00:01:56.070> ever<00:01:56.219> been

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
seems to me that nobody's ever been

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.499 
seems to me that nobody's ever been

I<00:02:58.940> think<00:02:59.300> perhaps<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.750> few<00:02:59.989> years<00:03:00.200> ago

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
I think perhaps a few years ago

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.120 
I think perhaps a few years ago
historically<00:03:01.040> when<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> few<00:03:01.610> amateur<00:03:02.480> fighters

sustained quite serious injuries through
boxing<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.140> suspect<00:03:06.860> at<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.190> time<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.640> did

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
boxing I suspect at that time it did

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.640 
boxing I suspect at that time it did
change<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.239> council's<00:03:08.690> position<00:03:09.170> somewhat

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
change the council's position somewhat

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.460 
change the council's position somewhat
and<00:03:09.920> perhaps<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.970> ought<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.569> just<00:03:11.660> perhaps<00:03:12.170> the
