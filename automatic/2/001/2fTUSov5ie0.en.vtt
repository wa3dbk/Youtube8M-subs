00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
really have about this figure is just

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.289 
really have about this figure is just
the<00:02:39.680> quality<00:02:40.040> control<00:02:40.430> issues<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.120> how

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
the quality control issues and just how

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.500 
the quality control issues and just how
fragile<00:02:42.079> this<00:02:42.409> guy<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.090> you're<00:02:44.299> buying

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
fragile this guy is now if you're buying

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
fragile this guy is now if you're buying
this<00:02:44.659> for<00:02:44.720> display<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.379> know<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.709> probably

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
this for display you know you probably

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.009 
this for display you know you probably
have<00:02:46.370> no<00:02:46.549> problem<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.269> it's<00:02:47.480> it's<00:02:47.690> very

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
have no problem but it's it's very

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.599 
have no problem but it's it's very
unnerving<00:02:48.560> when<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.980> get<00:02:49.129> this<00:02:49.250> guy<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.579> of

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
unnerving when you get this guy out of

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.699 
unnerving when you get this guy out of
the<00:02:49.730> box<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.359> first<00:02:50.989> thing<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.500> know<00:02:51.560> you

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
the box and first thing you know you

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.740 
the box and first thing you know you
have<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> piece<00:02:52.160> break<00:02:52.400> off<00:02:52.609> so<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.269> was<00:02:53.450> an<00:02:53.569> easy

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
have a piece break off so it was an easy

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.170 
have a piece break off so it was an easy
fix<00:02:53.870> but<00:02:54.230> overall<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:55.010> still<00:02:55.430> wish<00:02:55.640> NECA<00:02:55.940> would

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
fix but overall I still wish NECA would

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.270 
fix but overall I still wish NECA would
be<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.329> little<00:02:56.599> bit<00:02:56.720> more<00:02:57.109> on<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.470> ball<00:02:57.680> as<00:02:57.920> far

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
be a little bit more on the ball as far

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.539 
be a little bit more on the ball as far
as<00:02:58.609> their<00:02:58.819> quality<00:02:59.450> control<00:02:59.480> goes<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
as their quality control goes have the

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.089 
as their quality control goes have the
same<00:03:01.760> sort<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.060> issue<00:03:02.239> with<00:03:02.859> some<00:03:03.859> of<00:03:03.980> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
same sort of issue with some of the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.430 
same sort of issue with some of the
portal<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.849> Atlas<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.510> p-body<00:03:05.690> figures

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
portal to the Atlas and p-body figures

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.220 
portal to the Atlas and p-body figures
they<00:03:06.950> were<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.280> very<00:03:07.569> very<00:03:08.569> fragile<00:03:08.840> and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
they were just very very fragile and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.160 
they were just very very fragile and
very<00:03:09.530> very<00:03:09.769> flimsy<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.489> but<00:03:11.420> overall<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.019> is
