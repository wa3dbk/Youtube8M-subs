00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
 my channel this time I come to talk about a 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.670
 news of ps 4 but before you start 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.410
 I have to say hello to some of my 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.830
 subscribers if they asked me there 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 we go 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.100
 raúl santana rubén penella tirabuzón hd 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 and javier red greetings and 6 now yes 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 we started with the news sony has 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 confirmed that a pack of ps will come out 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.260
 4 of a terabyte plus the joy of war 3 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 remaster for 400 solos said so that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.090
 will go on sale on July 15 I will 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 I have already seen in several stores both in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770
 amazon like in game psych in game you have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
 have to reserve it to have this pack and the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.870
 truth is that if you are thinking about 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 buy osuna ps4 now is the time and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.690
 is that the ps 4 console plus a fabric 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.449
 apart it will weigh two kilos and a half less 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.640
 that the current console will spend less light 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.060
 that that also fuck will be noticed in the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.480
 invoice is 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.240
 then apart the gozo war 3 remaster wars 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.080
 and already some software three on ps3 looked 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.420
 wonder imagine the joy guard three 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.760
 remaster at 1080p and 60 frames per second 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.610
 I have seen the game 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.190
 and the truth is that you see that you flip 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.950
 boy is really amazing the truth 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.870
 is that it is really worth this pack what 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.270
 what I say is that they created the ones that 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.690
 we buy the start console as per 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.600
 example was my case it's clear on my pc 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.369
 4 is 500 gigs and of course now now 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.240
 I have a lot of games and when it comes to 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.619
 install a game because it puts me and eliminate 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.090
 data of this game to install this 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.890
 game because you already have the hard drive 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.440
 full and I do not know who is 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.110
 happened the great idea of sony to put 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.740
 to these consoles 500 gigas when they knew 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.020
 them that that 500 gb we go is not worth to 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 nothing because then they fill seriously 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.040
 and that 's what I say 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.650
 and that is to buy the start consoles 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 it's a mistake people are wrong because 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.830
 clear now look 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.710
 if you wait a bit you have this pack 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.100
 of the ps4 one more fabric ergo software 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.830
 remaster for 400 euros and it's a pack that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.539
 really worth it and even 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.370
