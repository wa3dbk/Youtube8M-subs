00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello people 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.090
 It's okay to sit here a little bit 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.420
 A lot of people have asked how 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.160
 is the situation of the left ear river 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 he public- based touch 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.500
 focus salseiro that which was of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 left is for those who do not remember is the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 infection was in the right passed through 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 left 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.250
 I do not know how it's already heard, there's more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.469
 pain does not have anything else but really 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 security issue tube 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 I really have got the bike almost all 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.500
 day because it's incredibly affects the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 balance and more affects the notion of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 face distance 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 I'm very much in trouble to understand the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 away both front and back 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.629
 side so then I'm adapting 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.399
 still can not enjoy 100% but already 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.940
 you can walk with a certain insecurity is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.800
 that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.049
 here maybe half- voice and another to admit and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.180
 dependents as co begins a treatment 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.080
 with Speech-Language Pathologist is not legal is legal 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.940
 too much 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.950
 This is not to say that life is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.049
 a dung which does not mean that the tone 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.200
 fucking bitter because of that 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 apple revealing your music is also wrong 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 with you and program for eventually 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.009
 accompany the instrument when you play 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 very much nor much trouble to put 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.350
 nervous and committed the crime 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.080
 the tone is very much the same in every case 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.720
 or studying for what better and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.560
 semtran not that searching will not cure 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.020
 But for you or not, I'll go, I guess. 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.440
 that I adapt to this different way 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.810
 to deal with music and a white and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.810
 certain an important thing 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.160
 this really I think still has endless 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.440
 possibilities of agents and pms and enjoy 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.210
 moments and sandim all 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.970
 possibilities or charge that this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.600
 here is the lack of shock 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.180
 Putin, then, let's get the hang of it. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.710
 problem incorporates life better way 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.990
 possible and move on 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.240
 It's what I've been doing and then twisting. 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.730
 It's all in shit, man, live life. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890
 normal and easy I know they were 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.990
 concerned about this and not always the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.480
 for a while but now very much 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.880
 worried it's not good from here 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.380
 little I adapt fully is everything 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.870
 sure and life goes on 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.360
 beauty beauty for you and one more group 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.600
 always remembering that he cuts the fairs and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.760
 Saturdays have the big videos and another 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 I have to say it 's a good week. 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.260
 taking away the organic minor who missed 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.700
 in SÃ£o Roque 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.700
 hugs this because such
