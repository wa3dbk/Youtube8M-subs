this diagram the best way to think of
these<00:02:59.760> channels<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:01.650> imagine<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.459> river<00:03:03.019> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
these channels is to imagine a river and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.649 
these channels is to imagine a river and
you<00:03:04.230> know<00:03:04.379> how<00:03:04.620> water<00:03:05.010> saturates<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.120> banks

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
you know how water saturates the banks

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.099 
you know how water saturates the banks
of<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.900> river<00:03:07.010> well<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.250> how<00:03:08.489> Chi<00:03:09.109> saturates

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
of a river well that's how Chi saturates

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.259 
of a river well that's how Chi saturates
the<00:03:10.409> tissues<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.459> flows<00:03:11.790> through<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the tissues have flows through the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.409 
the tissues have flows through the
channels<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.859> can<00:03:14.069> access<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.060> chief

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
channels and we can access the chief

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.789 
channels and we can access the chief
series<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.620> points<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.180> over<00:03:18.799> 360

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
series of points there are over 360

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.909 
series of points there are over 360
points<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> body<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.410> these<00:03:22.560> points

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
points of the body think of these points

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.539 
points of the body think of these points
as<00:03:23.280> ports<00:03:23.940> along<00:03:24.419> the<00:03:24.660> river<00:03:25.250> some<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.370> these

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
as ports along the river some of these

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.659 
as ports along the river some of these
ports<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.299> little<00:03:27.930> one-horse<00:03:28.530> times<00:03:28.980> with<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
ports are little one-horse times with a

stop sign in to post office there's not
much<00:03:32.579> there<00:03:33.560> some<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:34.859> points<00:03:35.220> are

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
much there some of these points are

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.319 
much there some of these points are
major<00:03:36.000> points<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.109> have<00:03:37.669> influence<00:03:38.669> on<00:03:38.790> many

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
major points that have influence on many

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.020 
major points that have influence on many
different<00:03:39.629> bugs<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.260> body<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
different bugs of the body and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.680 
different bugs of the body and
communicate<00:03:42.030> with<00:03:42.269> other<00:03:42.569> parts<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.319> body

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
communicate with other parts of the body

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.069 
communicate with other parts of the body
so<00:03:45.690> there<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.819> essentially<00:03:47.819> two<00:03:48.150> difficult

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
so there are essentially two difficult

so there are essentially two difficult
parts<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.680> Chinese<00:03:50.069> medicine<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.940> first<00:03:51.209> is

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
parts of Chinese medicine the first is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.869 
parts of Chinese medicine the first is
figuring<00:03:52.560> out<00:03:52.560> what's<00:03:52.949> going<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.400> with<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
figuring out what's going on with the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.470 
figuring out what's going on with the
patient<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.449> the<00:03:55.319> second<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:56.480> determining

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
patient and the second is determining

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.409 
patient and the second is determining
which<00:03:57.840> points<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.500> use<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.639> treat<00:03:59.909> a<00:03:59.970> given

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
which points to use to treat a given

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.360 
which points to use to treat a given
problem<00:04:02.299> once<00:04:03.299> we<00:04:03.599> determine<00:04:04.290> what's<00:04:04.919> going

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
problem once we determine what's going

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.710 
problem once we determine what's going
on<00:04:05.579> with<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:05.849> patient<00:04:06.180> then<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.319> can<00:04:07.560> use<00:04:07.859> a

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
on with a patient then we can use a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.750 
on with a patient then we can use a
number<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.870> tools<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.979> treat<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.459> patient

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.620 

now<00:04:15.360> in<00:04:15.569> Chinese<00:04:16.049> medicine<00:04:17.090> when<00:04:18.090> we<00:04:18.299> talk

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
now in Chinese medicine when we talk

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.949 
now in Chinese medicine when we talk
about<00:04:19.340> organs<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:20.880> talk<00:04:21.180> about<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.630> heart

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
about organs and we talk about the heart

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.469 
about organs and we talk about the heart
and<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> ones<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.100> spleen<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.000> kidney

and the ones in the spleen in the kidney
and<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.750> liver<00:04:25.580> we're<00:04:26.580> talking<00:04:27.120> about<00:04:27.210> a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and the liver we're talking about a

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.980 
and the liver we're talking about a
whole<00:04:27.690> constellation<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:29.010> things<00:04:29.990> for

whole constellation of things for

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.250 
whole constellation of things for

heart in Western medicine i'm talking

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.270 
heart in Western medicine i'm talking
about<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:37.530> myocardium<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.740> only<00:04:40.740> the

that<00:04:46.460> runs<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:48.139> heartbeat<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.430> Chinese

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that runs the heartbeat but in Chinese

wonderful things about thought the
medicine<00:05:24.720> itself<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.440> that<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.830> does<00:05:26.010> not

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
medicine itself is that it does not

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.240 
medicine itself is that it does not
separate<00:05:26.910> I'm<00:05:27.120> from<00:05:27.510> body<00:05:27.840> and<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.770> looks<00:05:29.010> at

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
separate I'm from body and it looks at

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.870 
separate I'm from body and it looks at
the<00:05:29.370> body<00:05:29.610> as<00:05:29.849> a<00:05:29.880> whole<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:31.340> we're<00:05:32.340> not<00:05:32.490> talking

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
the body as a whole so we're not talking

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.029 
the body as a whole so we're not talking
about<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.270> heart<00:05:33.599> I'm<00:05:33.870> also<00:05:34.260> talking<00:05:34.710> about

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
about the heart I'm also talking about

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.870 
about the heart I'm also talking about
its<00:05:35.580> relation<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:37.169> kidneys<00:05:37.770> I'm<00:05:38.099> talking

its relation to the kidneys I'm talking

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.390 
its relation to the kidneys I'm talking
about<00:05:38.910> its<00:05:39.270> relation<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:39.930> consciousness<00:05:40.919> or
