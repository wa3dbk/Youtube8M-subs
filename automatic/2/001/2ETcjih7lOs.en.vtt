00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 record successes 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 so also before the olympic games 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 this year in london 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.030
 janine berger was unexpected for the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.530

 So it was a big event in London 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 and in retrospect, I'm happy 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 course over the fourth place 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
 Of course I was annoyed at the beginning 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.570
 but I never thought that me 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.670
 to drive to olympia at all 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.560
 behind the peak performances of the 16 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.820
 year is also the strong backing 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.680
 They keep coming back and it would be a pity 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.960
 if myself internet arises 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.120
 Jeannins parents accompany their daughter 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
 to pick it up through all heights and depths 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.540

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.760
 and they also see the positive 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 In the meantime, the sport has become more influential 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.020
 has the life of her daughter 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 what this series is aiming for 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.820
 Straight line also the national coach 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.740
 ulla cook is impressed by the courage and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.540
 the determination of the young athlete 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 she is happy that her protege for 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.420
 the initiative values ​​scholarship 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.240
 was selected 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.310
 So the sport assistance altogether is quite 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.480
 important just for us because the girls 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.160
 are all students 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.660
 we have no sponsors and the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 Sporthilfe, the bridge is our biggest 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.690
 the sport is jeannins passion and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.670
 The fun is not too short 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.890
 together with her training partners 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 the ssv ulm they are a well-rehearsed 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.690
 troupe already means a lot to me 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 sport but it is my life actually 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.630
 I learned so he lent himself 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.000
 just great the next sporting goal 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.530
 the 16-year-old took fourth place 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.019
 the upcoming olympic games 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.010
 improve 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.770
 So for me, in any case, the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.660
 Great hope for 2016 that you can handle it 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.820
 and until January , janine has four more 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.310
 years, one or the other 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.490
