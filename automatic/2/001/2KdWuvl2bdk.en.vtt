 I am in Germany since seven years and Komax Turkmenistan that

 is on the Caspian Sea 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.050
 I was glad when the puck bounced he stopped 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.150
 and that does not drive me anymore exists in the Civic Room world since I sent 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.180
 always wanted to choose this profession and my feelings 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.359
 can pee 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.359
 and that was a geriatric nurse 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.130
 in Germany 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 now also in the families 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.750
 the desire of the family or Turkish family and give it to him 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.670
 even her parents in nursing homes and then of course, if she smells her plus 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 Tischer Altenpflegerin goes to the Russian Place Health and then 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 maybe he will trust many more 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.800
 Lately there are critical ones 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.210
 all the holidays they have in this profession are working with drug problems 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 but that's not going to make such people even ruin their citizens 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.650
 such chiefs rent 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.640
 Storage SGi cents he became a feature film and we also learn in the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 School child Petersch work that means they should be in the way of ours 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.820

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 Nikkei falls in this Below umgarnt with the people 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.920
 my family found that the code that I have chosen this occupation 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 because I can bring in mine earlier 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 and of course there's disease are only the people driving in Menzingen counterattack 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 as Reimer and they can not understand 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.560
 For example, these deal with the people and then they forget some time 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 but dino old healthy people 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.530
 You can get a lot of data from Udo and sugar many of them learn as well 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 on the edge 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.980
 I think France is better 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.200
 because 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 is there this change? 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.230
 I'm with the Bernese 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.270
 because patients and then on the go Untermeitingen thereby become other there 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.890
 and not every day the same Rios to Sundays different people different 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.509
 employment 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.289
 I imagine that later I work in the outpatient nursing service because there 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.959
 flexible working hours and so much free time for me and me for the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.859
 Familys 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.709
 Worked cards for 1 temporary help with an outpatient service 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.719
 and then I had to be dependent on a specialist because I was allowed 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.359
 do not do some things alone 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.540
 and that's why I am 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.879
 in Sweden for training for this knowledge 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.790
 to be independent of someone 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.790
 and be qualified in my job 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.209
 this he was on dax-end at 3 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.849
 we learn so much anatomy 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.540
 Drugs Thielke Rtg where would ask our knowledge in Butare 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.569
 those who stepped in the school know we improve and boost rock 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 I am very satisfied with the training 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.319
 and when I get home, I do not feel like a girl like that 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.710
 that is confident and formal all day 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.160
 and I'm still in a good mood you do something like that there are in there 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.139
 School lives 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.409
