come on in close here normally what I
like<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.310> put<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.700> screen<00:02:25.030> down

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
like to do is put the screen down

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.650 
like to do is put the screen down
between<00:02:26.830> two<00:02:27.100> frames<00:02:27.519> just<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
between two frames just like so and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.530 
between two frames just like so and
wedge<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.459> I'm<00:02:30.580> altering<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.420> now

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
wedge it in but I'm altering it now

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.110 
wedge it in but I'm altering it now
because<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.110> cold<00:02:32.380> I'm<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.670> set<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
because it's cold I'm going to set the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.449 
because it's cold I'm going to set the
pack<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.750> little<00:02:35.050> Queen<00:02:35.260> cage<00:02:35.500> upside<00:02:36.160> down

pack that little Queen cage upside down

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.300 
pack that little Queen cage upside down
and<00:02:36.870> we've<00:02:37.870> centered<00:02:38.260> our<00:02:38.410> frames<00:02:38.830> we've<00:02:39.160> got

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and we've centered our frames we've got

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.270 
and we've centered our frames we've got
two<00:02:39.519> frames<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.150> brought<00:02:40.540> up<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.280> reason

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
two frames just brought up the reason

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.670 
two frames just brought up the reason
I'm<00:02:42.400> doing<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:42.760> if<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.900> put<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.350> Queen

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
I'm doing this if you put that Queen

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.400 
I'm doing this if you put that Queen
cage<00:02:44.980> between<00:02:45.610> two<00:02:45.850> frames<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.380> a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
cage between two frames you have a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890 
cage between two frames you have a
narrow<00:02:47.769> space<00:02:48.190> here<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.480> drops<00:02:49.750> down

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
narrow space here and if it drops down

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.490 
narrow space here and if it drops down
to<00:02:50.260> 25<00:02:50.709> again<00:02:51.069> tomorrow<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.900> space<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.470> too

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to 25 again tomorrow the space is too

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350 
to 25 again tomorrow the space is too
narrow<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.190> bees<00:02:54.370> can't<00:02:54.730> keep<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.120> Queen

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
