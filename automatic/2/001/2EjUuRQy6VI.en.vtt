00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 other than 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.540
 Y 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.210
 answer 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.450
 two experiences because these days the 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.910
 child sexual abuse is hidden because 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.400
 it is harmful 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 for other reasons it was hidden because the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.000
 boy feels damaged the boy does not 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.289
 live as something pleasurable but what 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.040
 live as a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 as an appropriation as an abuse as 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.610
 an attack the boy can not denounce the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.280
 abuse at a time when it receives the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.739
 patient who is sexually abused by 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.550
 Your therapist can not report it either 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 because he is in a situation where 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.970
 submits to the authority of the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 psychotherapists for example that is to say that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 everything about sexual abuse in boys or in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.949
 people who are in a situation of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 dependence on the abuser so 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.909
 be 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 can not be announced immediately 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:10.619
 because there are a number of events that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 is abortion contribute to the abused 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.140
 It is inhibited the system prestancia 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.190
 is owed to minorities 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.220
 in this case childhood 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.790
 We want to tell you that we are not just 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 giving him more but in the course of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.640
 the interview that we are going to ask 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.330
 marcela please what 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 give us tools 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:47.000
 concrete for the teacher that is like 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.930
 a fundamental part in this in this 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.260
 in this chain for professionals of 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.260
 health 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 for the judicial sector itself that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:03.509
 projected a proposal that also 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.759
 can do we do not rely on criticism 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.360
 We will try to collaborate and give 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.700
 tools to finish with this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.180
 we remind you for those who have 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.180
 access 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.560
 well we are in the last block 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.420
 opening paths with doctor norberto 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.480
 Barruti director of children's hospital 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.219
 but from Lizalde and current coordinator of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.629
 the violence assistance network of the 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.400
 health ministry of the government of the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.859
 City of Buenos Aires - the doctor 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.450
 we are going to ask for a final message both 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.659
 for people for the professional sector 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.970
 of the health of education and power 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.430
 judicial 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.400
 yes I think that in front of this 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.580
 problematic and attentive to the decision that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.460
 you have to do prevention 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.520
 we were talking about doing 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.130
 prevention in different stages on 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.190
 everything after the appearance of 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.860
 problem because the symptomatic boy is 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 the boy who already has the problem 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.510
 acquired 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.249
 then that is secondary prevention 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.170
 and tertiary prevention is when 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.780
 we were talking about the whole process 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.989
 therapeutic and the possibility in everything 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.689
 case of making a repair work 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.060
 about repair to provoke 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.340
 resilience but here it seems to me that 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 we must put the accent on prevention 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.389
 primary that is before the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.239
 event may occur and for 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:02.689
 this can be effective necessarily 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.120
 we must turn to sex education and 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.990
 sex education has nothing to do with 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.740
 genitality 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:15.200
 it has to do with what is necessary 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.959
 respect the sexuality of each individual 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.070
 of each boy and start with this from 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.380
 very early and the body care has 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.990
 what to do with this also the boy has 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.190
 that learning to take care of your body has 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.590
 than learning what is worthy of the 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.000
 respect for others and respect 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.510
 also the other is necessary of the boy 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.090
 know that your body belongs to you and that you do not 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.790
 must be invaded by another and in everything 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.880
 case if the contact should be promoted 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.700
 body transmitting affection through 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.280
 from the kiss through the hug through 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.680
 the caress but neither alves are the hug 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.990
 nor does the caress pass through the genitals of 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.280
 a boy and know the guy who has 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.500
 intimate parts that only he handles and 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.680
 that does not have to do with the father the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.370
 mother the grandfather who come in any case 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.229
 to supply this function to the extent that 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.160
 we give the boy the 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:21.020
 tools for your own care 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.509
 surely we will have contributed to 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.550
 avoid abusive situations that 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.350
 may occur later because the 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.289
 boy is ready to say no 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.080
 that something does not tolerate that something 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.389
 it is uncomfortable and has a possibility in 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.330
 any case of resorting to a third party to 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.500
 responsible to transmit this to you 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.560
 with all energy 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.570
 with many very many thanks 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.820
 thank you very much for having been so 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.820
 we reconvene again please we want 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.820
 move along
