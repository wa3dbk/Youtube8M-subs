00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.969
 that had already forgotten the lie series 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.200
 the series is still standing I had some 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.480
 problems to be recording but 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.489
 look here is the reinforcement we had 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.010
 in the last chapter that either 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.260
 I reached to pass the is this defense 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.570
 right the law and good since it 's 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.570
 established that let's go for the party 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.009

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.269
 100 pure bronze chemistry let's go 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.520
 against bronze cigars but they're fine 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.070
 interpenetrated to see if we do not have there 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.110
 some kind of problems the goalie with 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.630
 the bar looks sensual 11 of the place not 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.670
 as I do that and take it from me 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.680
 I do not know if they remember there before 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.070
 they had already seen me in 2.0 but well 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.270
 now for the party that is not there you have to 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.990
 win the boys to continue with the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.010
 reinforcements to continue with the reinforcements 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.739
 the game starts guys we take off 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.810
 us and let's go with everything let's go point 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.450
 to try to win the game 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.790
 come on here I can tell you you royce ya 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.660
 you were royce you have it today you define the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.490
 defines defines the goal of marko 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.350
 rose minute just at minute 2 we 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.510
 we put forward is the party seems 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.210
 that is declining for us very 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.440
 well very good goal there then definition 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.630
 regular sea ​​colors because the goalkeeper 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.310
 someone deviated if it is not bronze the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200
 doorman I think yes the truth for what 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.150
 I would have taken out but well that does not matter 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.740
 and we are going ahead of a marker very 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.900
 very very sad do not have to call corres 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.910
 doing the pass very well and the goalkeeper 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.229
 I say the claw but like not the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.119
 claw and bronze and going but 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.119
 good we started strong in the game 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 We started strong and hopefully continue to hopefully 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.540
 to follow nothing because he already put a break and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.540
 I do not know if it's going away 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.170
 no mistake leave nothing in the defense and already 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.900
 it's not brand right after burning like 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.370
 we 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.430
 what to see normal 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.820
 went to the place well out of place 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.990
 what a surprise what a surprise 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.930
 and for nothing out of the place for nothing 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.500
 well guys we saved 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.020
 only the forwards remain and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 nothing seeing that there are hours and goal but 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.670
 because they are left alone I do not understand 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.530
 look look where the other is where he is 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.060
 my defense what courage 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.440
 the super defender back there so that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.150
 enable and so that they do not enter outside the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.829
 big place 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.829
 that this is pure run nothing more 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.610
 incredible pure pure incredible running 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.610
 run 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.670
 let's play pure run then 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.650
 I also know how to run 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.390
 I also know how to run, I also know 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.390
 run takes I also know how to run 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.950
 if what happens is that you do not have to play 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.560
 Well, if he runs, it's also 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.430
 he 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 let's go to 2 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.290
 I already asked and I saw you 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.450
 the grandmother 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.440
 the flying carnalito 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.500
 we are going to excellent assistance this signature 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.740
 the brook signs the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 self- less less deserved me I deserved it 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.420
 he deserved it is a goal of the types of 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.630
 underworld but I deserved it good we 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.500
 we put ahead again 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.500
 What do goals 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.950
 and what a goal he conceded incredible but 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.880
 well we carry forward guys releasing 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.370
 a little tension 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.560
 basic half time we have thrown three 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.410
 Sometimes we got three goals no 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.850
 we got lucky and he has 2 522 3 good 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.130
 well we have a little more 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.260
 position and I do not know the game been weird 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.780
 I defend is complicated because 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.820
 look like your bronzes run pretty 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.620
 seem to run a lot and knows how 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.180
 explode the speed so too 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.370
 let's explode the speed we 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.960
 as we leave with the second time the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.280
 guys start the second time value to 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.900
 hands of the rival let's try to 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.010
 keep the advantage that a goal is a 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.810
 goal and it is in fifa a goal does not assure you 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.810
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.509
 you go marquitos you go marquito about 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.509
 let's go let's go 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.379
 I sold myself I sold myself I sold myself I sold 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:43.540
 I sold the porch and it does not move 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:47.640
 but nothing happens it will not enter 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:52.710
 we do not see that good machis defines pretty 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.300
 watching the goal of bach and we put ourselves 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.930
 4-2 on the scoreboard we went ahead 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.430
 by two goals while the game already 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.520
 was beginning to complicate but at 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.100
 precede is going to our side and that 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.310
 better better better better it took off very 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.200
 nice to the rival there with a gift is a 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.810
 write of action a body nothing 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.650
 moving the incredible body we are going to 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.370
 put japanese 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.800
 Japanese golden with I thought it did not go 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.169
 but which holder the Japanese a shot that 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.810
 was going to nothing ended in fag's goal 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.150
 what a beautiful goal of the Japanese that a 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.289
 move that looked like it was lost 5 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.899
 2 boys are already 3 goals and cough 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.029
 the game is over the game is over 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:44.309
 of recre there are parties and fierce 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:48.210
 we won by difference of three goals and 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:49.469
 all very very good the match was 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.490
 suffering at the beginning but in the end 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.439
 we carry it that is what matters to the 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.110
 final we take the game by three 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.369
 goals of difference boys musicians 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.069
 united they saw we will do by difference 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.899
 of three goals and that means we were going 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.949
 to sign better than those who follow in the 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.619
 list remember that we are signing up 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.869
 according to the lowest average until that of 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.819
 higher average and we're going to do two 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:10.529
 players who followed was this 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.559
 central defense know that you look 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.520
 pretty good it has 67 rhythm 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.930
 Four sensation in physique can 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.939
 go pretty well on the screen and 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.249
 also the one who followed was this one to me 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:22.619
 the one that everyone says that she looks like a woman 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.229
 it looks so bad but it can help us there 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:27.240
 It is not that it is so good and the other 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.999
 by winning by three goals difference is 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.039
 a bonus signing that is what is going to be 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.050
 the bonus signing will leave you three 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.339
 players in a vote and also 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.319
 probably avoid them are going to be 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.889
 seeing on the screen magnets and in the 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.110
 comments 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.599
 which one should I sign and it would be 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.880
 the third signing to complete the 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.280
