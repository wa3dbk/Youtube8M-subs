that you're going to find is the sensor
in<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.129> camera<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.330> if<00:00:33.449> I<00:00:33.540> take<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.870> lens

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
in this camera and if I take the lens

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
in this camera and if I take the lens
off<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.830> is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> removable<00:00:35.550> lens<00:00:35.730> system

point-and-shoot<00:01:04.430> turn<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.550> on<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
point-and-shoot turn it on you get a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.240 
point-and-shoot turn it on you get a
nice<00:01:07.710> big<00:01:08.160> LCD<00:01:09.060> screen<00:01:09.690> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.140> give<00:01:11.130> us

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
nice big LCD screen on the back give us

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.620 
nice big LCD screen on the back give us
something<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.700> more<00:01:11.820> exciting<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> look

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
something a little more exciting to look

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.010 
something a little more exciting to look
at<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:14.460> an<00:01:14.610> articulating<00:01:15.270> LCD<00:01:15.390> screen

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
at here it's an articulating LCD screen

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.300 
at here it's an articulating LCD screen
so<00:01:16.259> instead<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.709> screen<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.100> always

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so instead of the screen just always

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.639 
so instead of the screen just always
being<00:01:17.670> folded<00:01:17.880> flat<00:01:18.360> into<00:01:18.539> the<00:01:18.690> camera<00:01:18.929> it

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
being folded flat into the camera it

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.540 
being folded flat into the camera it
actually<00:01:20.280> folds<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.819> and<00:01:21.360> around<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.340> do

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
actually folds up and around so I can do

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.399 
actually folds up and around so I can do
overhead<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.060> low<00:01:24.300> angle<00:01:24.690> shots<00:01:24.929> with<00:01:25.170> ease

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
overhead or low angle shots with ease

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.580 
overhead or low angle shots with ease
I<00:01:26.469> capture<00:01:27.369> 14<00:01:27.729> megapixel<00:01:28.329> stills<00:01:28.420> here<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:29.049> can

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
I capture 14 megapixel stills here I can

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.289 
I capture 14 megapixel stills here I can
capture<00:01:29.920> those<00:01:30.159> at<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.579> seven<00:01:30.880> frames<00:01:31.030> per

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299

capture those at up to seven frames per
second<00:01:31.689> maximum<00:01:32.200> resolution<00:01:32.999> and<00:01:33.999> I<00:01:34.390> can<00:01:34.539> also

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
second maximum resolution and I can also

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.169

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.440 

I<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:51.110> capture<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.800> only<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:52.130> 2d<00:02:52.550> image<00:02:52.580> but

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
I can capture not only a 2d image but

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.570 
I can capture not only a 2d image but
maybe<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:53.990> 3d<00:02:54.350> TV<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.370> want<00:02:55.550> to

maybe I have a 3d TV and I want to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.640 
maybe I have a 3d TV and I want to
capture<00:02:55.790> 3d<00:02:56.270> as<00:02:56.420> well<00:02:56.600> camera<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.440> fully

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.120 
capture 3d as well camera is fully
capable<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.300> all<00:02:59.660> with<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.800> single

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
capable of that so all with one single

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.310 
capable of that so all with one single
lens<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.640> camera<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.750> how<00:03:02.900> do<00:03:02.960> we<00:03:03.110> capture

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
lens on the camera so how do we capture

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320 
lens on the camera so how do we capture
a<00:03:03.530> 3d<00:03:03.920> image<00:03:04.070> with<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> single<00:03:04.880> lens<00:03:05.120> on

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
a 3d image with just a single lens on

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.150 
a 3d image with just a single lens on
the<00:03:05.360> camera<00:03:05.450> we<00:03:06.410> do<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.800> same<00:03:07.010> way

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the camera we do it the same way

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.040 
the camera we do it the same way
essentially<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.910> we<00:03:08.030> capture<00:03:08.420> panoramic

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
essentially that we capture panoramic

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.830 
essentially that we capture panoramic
images<00:03:09.910> basically<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.240> sweep<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.540> camera

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
images basically as you sweep the camera

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.690 
images basically as you sweep the camera
across<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.260> frame<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.920> capturing<00:03:13.400> to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
across the frame it's capturing to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.910 
across the frame it's capturing to
individual<00:03:14.300> images<00:03:14.720> at<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.110> same<00:03:15.320> time<00:03:15.560> after

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
individual images at the same time after

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.130 
individual images at the same time after
I<00:03:16.550> finish<00:03:16.850> my<00:03:16.880> sweep<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.510> stitches<00:03:17.870> them

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
I finish my sweep it stitches them

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.960 
I finish my sweep it stitches them
together<00:03:18.260> combines<00:03:18.950> them<00:03:19.130> into<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.520> single

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
together combines them into that single

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.450 
together combines them into that single
3d<00:03:20.600> image<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.230> looks<00:03:21.260> incredibly<00:03:22.220> beautiful

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
3d image that looks incredibly beautiful

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.960 
3d image that looks incredibly beautiful
on<00:03:22.970> your<00:03:23.240> 3d<00:03:23.540> TV<00:03:23.950> shooting<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.040> 3d<00:03:25.340> image<00:03:25.520> is<00:03:25.850> as

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
on your 3d TV shooting a 3d image is as

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.820 
on your 3d TV shooting a 3d image is as
simple<00:03:26.150> as<00:03:26.480> changing<00:03:26.900> your<00:03:27.230> shooting<00:03:27.530> mode<00:03:27.680> on

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
the camera I'm going to slide down to 3d

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.970 
the camera I'm going to slide down to 3d
sweep<00:03:30.560> panorama<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:32.290> all<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.350> do<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.680> follow

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
sweep panorama and all I do is follow

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.250 
sweep panorama and all I do is follow
the<00:03:34.160> on-screen<00:03:34.840> push<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.990> shutter<00:03:36.140> button

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
the on-screen push the shutter button

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.380 
the on-screen push the shutter button
and<00:03:36.709> pan<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.100> camera<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:37.910> direction<00:03:38.120> of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
and pan the camera in the direction of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.930 
and pan the camera in the direction of
the<00:03:38.480> arrow<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.650> am<00:03:39.980> going<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.190> start<00:03:40.430> over

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
the arrow so I am going to start over

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:53.350 
the arrow so I am going to start over
here<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.330> our<00:03:41.450> little<00:03:41.630> balloon<00:03:42.459> area<00:03:43.570> point

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.970 

it's<00:03:53.750> going<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.960> take<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.200> second<00:03:54.680> for<00:03:54.710> it<00:03:54.890> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
it's going to take a second for it to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.900 
it's going to take a second for it to
process<00:03:56.590> now<00:03:57.590> what<00:03:57.950> you're<00:03:58.070> seeing<00:03:58.130> here<00:03:58.460> and

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
process now what you're seeing here and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.310 
process now what you're seeing here and
I<00:03:58.970> stopped<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.510> little<00:03:59.630> bit<00:03:59.810> early<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.140> we

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
I stopped it a little bit early so we

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.540 
I stopped it a little bit early so we
didn't<00:04:00.530> see<00:04:00.620> all<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.800> crowds<00:04:01.010> on<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.340> side

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
didn't see all the crowds on the side

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.120 
didn't see all the crowds on the side
hence<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.000> gray<00:04:02.180> bar<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:03.170> you're<00:04:03.410> seeing<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.740> 2d

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130

so<00:06:08.040> just<00:06:08.220> that<00:06:08.340> simple<00:06:08.580> point<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.150> sweep

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
so just that simple point and sweep

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.650 
so just that simple point and sweep
motion<00:06:11.330> captures<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.480> image<00:06:14.510> somebody<00:06:15.510> may

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
motion captures the image somebody may

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.190 
motion captures the image somebody may
look<00:06:15.810> familiar<00:06:15.990> in<00:06:16.380> these<00:06:16.500> images<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:18.200> choose

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
look familiar in these images I choose

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.610 
look familiar in these images I choose
tilting<00:06:19.650> playback<00:06:20.040> option

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.800 

so<00:06:27.190> it's<00:06:27.370> almost<00:06:27.520> like<00:06:27.729> a<00:06:27.850> move<00:06:28.210> I'm<00:06:28.419> moving

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
so it's almost like a move I'm moving

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.280 
so it's almost like a move I'm moving
around<00:06:29.020> here<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:30.520> until<00:06:31.240> you<00:06:31.330> get<00:06:31.479> your<00:06:31.570> 3d<00:06:31.930> TV

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
around here so until you get your 3d TV

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.800 
around here so until you get your 3d TV
you<00:06:32.470> can<00:06:32.500> kind<00:06:32.919> of<00:06:33.010> view<00:06:33.250> your<00:06:33.520> simulated<00:06:34.389> 3d

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
you can kind of view your simulated 3d

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:49.610 
you can kind of view your simulated 3d
images<00:06:35.290> right<00:06:36.250> on<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.550> back<00:06:36.699> of<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:36.910> camera

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.430 

when<00:06:50.250> you're<00:06:50.639> shooting<00:06:51.000> images<00:06:51.270> there's<00:06:52.139> a

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
when you're shooting images there's a

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.170 
when you're shooting images there's a
pair<00:06:52.680> of<00:06:52.800> motion<00:06:53.100> sensors<00:06:53.490> in<00:06:53.669> there<00:06:53.820> one<00:06:54.000> for

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
pair of motion sensors in there one for

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.969 
pair of motion sensors in there one for
horizontal<00:06:54.690> and<00:06:54.840> one<00:06:54.960> for<00:06:55.110> vertical<00:06:55.530> movement

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
horizontal and one for vertical movement

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.830 
horizontal and one for vertical movement
to<00:06:56.310> detect<00:06:56.699> how<00:06:57.030> the<00:06:57.090> cameras<00:06:57.600> moving

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
to detect how the cameras moving

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.230 
to detect how the cameras moving
incorrect<00:06:58.650> accordingly<00:06:59.100> in<00:06:59.460> playback<00:07:00.180> mode

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
incorrect accordingly in playback mode

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.090 
incorrect accordingly in playback mode
we<00:07:00.630> use<00:07:00.810> those<00:07:01.020> to<00:07:01.169> determine<00:07:01.620> how<00:07:02.040> the

we use those to determine how the
cameras<00:07:02.550> moving<00:07:02.729> and<00:07:03.060> how<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.210> adjust<00:07:03.510> the
