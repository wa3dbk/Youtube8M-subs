00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
different maneuvers this video is about

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400 
different maneuvers this video is about
the<00:00:14.070> turn<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> road<00:00:14.970> or<00:00:15.180> also<00:00:15.990> known<00:00:16.230> as

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
the turn in the road or also known as

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.640 
the turn in the road or also known as
three-pointer<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:19.050> before<00:00:19.200> we<00:00:19.380> shoot

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
three-pointer so just before we shoot

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.840 
three-pointer so just before we shoot
off<00:00:19.800> let's<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.190> look<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> couple<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
off let's just look at a couple of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.990 
off let's just look at a couple of
things<00:00:21.090> I'm<00:00:21.690> looking<00:00:22.350> ahead<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.610> get<00:00:23.880> an

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
things I'm looking ahead so I get an

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359 
things I'm looking ahead so I get an
idea<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.420> how<00:00:24.660> steep<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.380> might<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
idea of how steep it might be as I

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
idea of how steep it might be as I
approach<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.090> curb<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> right<00:00:28.170> or

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
approach the curb on the right or

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.260 
approach the curb on the right or
especially<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.460> approaching<00:00:29.850> the<00:00:30.090> curb

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
especially when I'm approaching the curb

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.450 
especially when I'm approaching the curb
on<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.570> way<00:00:30.720> back<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.680> left<00:00:32.070> side<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
on my way back on the left side of the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
on my way back on the left side of the
road<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.719> trying<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> gauge<00:00:34.289> you<00:00:34.620> know

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
road here just trying to gauge you know

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.770 
road here just trying to gauge you know
if<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.520> car<00:00:35.730> might<00:00:35.940> roll<00:00:36.180> forwards<00:00:36.660> or

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
if the car might roll forwards or

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.280 
if the car might roll forwards or
backwards<00:00:36.810> depending<00:00:37.470> on<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.600> steep<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
backwards depending on how steep the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
backwards depending on how steep the
camber<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> curve<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.940> I've

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
camber is going into the curve so I've

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
camber is going into the curve so I've
had<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> look<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.739> not

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
had a bit of a look at that and it's not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.530 
had a bit of a look at that and it's not
too<00:00:44.070> bad<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> particular<00:00:44.730> point<00:00:45.300> there's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
too bad at this particular point there's

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.729 
too bad at this particular point there's
a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> left<00:00:46.410> side<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
a little bit more on the left side of
the<00:00:46.829> road<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> in

driving point set on the clutch the hand
breaks<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.060> slowly<00:01:24.600> moving<00:01:24.900> away

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
breaks down I'm just slowly moving away

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.530 
breaks down I'm just slowly moving away
from<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> kerb<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.790> already<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.330> all

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
from the kerb and I've already got all

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020 
from the kerb and I've already got all
my<00:01:27.750> steering<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:29.640> slowly

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
my steering on so I'm just slowly

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.340 
my steering on so I'm just slowly
approaching<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.600> kerb<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.140> hand

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
approaching the kerb on the right hand

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
approaching the kerb on the right hand
side<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> road<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.270> just

side of the road now and I'm just

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
side of the road now and I'm just
waiting<00:01:33.810> until<00:01:34.080> my<00:01:34.350> reference<00:01:34.770> point<00:01:34.830> comes

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
waiting until my reference point comes

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
waiting until my reference point comes
in<00:01:35.400> under<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.820> mirror<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
little bit of the path and the kerb

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
little bit of the path and the kerb
under<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.570> hand<00:01:39.810> mirror<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.340> handbrake

on<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> first<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.689> finished<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.380> want

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
on that's the first part finished I want

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
on that's the first part finished I want
to<00:01:44.340> prepare<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> kind<00:01:45.000> reverse<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.619> just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to prepare the kind reverse now just

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649 
to prepare the kind reverse now just
make<00:01:46.920> sure<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> clutch<00:01:47.400> is<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.700> too<00:01:47.909> high<00:01:48.150> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
make sure the clutch is not too high so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
make sure the clutch is not too high so
the<00:01:48.780> car<00:01:48.960> doesn't<00:01:48.990> jump<00:01:49.409> backwards<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the car doesn't jump backwards but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
the car doesn't jump backwards but
making<00:01:51.090> sure<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.869> clutch<00:01:52.079> isn't<00:01:52.380> too

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
making sure that the clutch isn't too

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
making sure that the clutch isn't too
low<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.159> car<00:01:53.400> is<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> roll

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
low that my car is going to roll

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330 
low that my car is going to roll
forwards<00:01:54.390> towards<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.869> kerb<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.829> important

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
forwards towards the kerb it's important

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
forwards towards the kerb it's important
that<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:57.030> overhang<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> kerb<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
that I don't overhang the kerb at the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
that I don't overhang the kerb at the
front<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.280> obviously<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.180> important

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
front and it's obviously very important

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.230 
front and it's obviously very important
that<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:00.780> wheels<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.200> touch<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> kerb<00:02:01.770> also

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
that my wheels don't touch the kerb also

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.280 
that my wheels don't touch the kerb also
so<00:02:03.240> very<00:02:03.479> important<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:03.990> you're<00:02:04.079> carrying

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so very important when you're carrying

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260 
so very important when you're carrying
its<00:02:04.470> maneuver<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> reverse

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
its maneuver as I go to the reverse

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.789 
I'm done okay we're going to take a look
now<00:03:12.159> at<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.370> steering<00:03:12.700> method<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:14.200> turning

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
now at the steering method for turning

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.039 
now at the steering method for turning
the<00:03:14.890> road<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.329> you've<00:03:16.450> been<00:03:16.480> driving<00:03:17.019> with

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the road so if you've been driving with

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:17.670 
the road so if you've been driving with
me<00:03:17.260> already

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
me already

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.860 
me already
this<00:03:18.069> steering<00:03:18.970> technique<00:03:19.329> I'm<00:03:19.450> about<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.840> use

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
this steering technique I'm about to use

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.449 
this steering technique I'm about to use
will<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.380> seem<00:03:20.500> completely<00:03:20.769> normal<00:03:21.310> just

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
will just seem completely normal just

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.780 
will just seem completely normal just
waiting<00:03:22.180> for<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.359> car<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.720> come<00:03:22.750> past<00:03:23.139> me<00:03:23.790> there

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
waiting for a car to come past me there

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.839 
waiting for a car to come past me there
it<00:03:24.940> goes<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:26.319> I'll<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.160> car<00:03:27.459> prepared

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
it goes so I'll have the car prepared

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.000 
it goes so I'll have the car prepared
ready<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.269> go<00:03:28.450> I've<00:03:28.690> carried<00:03:29.650> out<00:03:29.859> my

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
ready to go I've carried out my

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.069 
ready to go I've carried out my
observations<00:03:30.639> now<00:03:30.849> my<00:03:31.090> right<00:03:31.299> hand<00:03:31.569> starting

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
observations now my right hand starting

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.270 
observations now my right hand starting
at<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.290> top<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.739> steering<00:03:32.980> wheel<00:03:33.160> because

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
at the top of the steering wheel because

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.670 
at the top of the steering wheel because
I'm<00:03:33.489> turning<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:35.379> once<00:03:35.560> I'm

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
I'm turning to the right so once I'm

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.830 
I'm turning to the right so once I'm
ready<00:03:35.829> to<00:03:36.069> go<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.970> you'll<00:03:37.239> notice<00:03:37.450> within

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
ready to go and you'll notice within

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.930 
ready to go and you'll notice within
just<00:03:38.230> being<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.950> few<00:03:39.160> centimetres<00:03:39.700> away<00:03:39.819> from

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
just being a few centimetres away from

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.930 
just being a few centimetres away from
the<00:03:40.209> curb<00:03:40.419> all<00:03:41.109> my<00:03:41.440> steering<00:03:41.889> will<00:03:42.010> be<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.280> so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the curb all my steering will be on so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.970 
the curb all my steering will be on so
I'll<00:03:43.090> be<00:03:43.239> generating<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.810> most<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.410> tightest

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
I'll be generating the most the tightest

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.729 
I'll be generating the most the tightest
arc<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.699> can<00:03:46.299> travel<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.379> other<00:03:47.440> side<00:03:47.709> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
arc I can travel to the other side of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.330 
arc I can travel to the other side of
the<00:03:47.919> road<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.849> if<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.120> go<00:03:49.269> watching<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.810> hands

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
the road so if we go watching the hands

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.879 
the road so if we go watching the hands
one<00:03:51.340> two<00:03:51.970> that's<00:03:52.449> it<00:03:52.690> I'm<00:03:52.810> done<00:03:52.989> I've<00:03:53.230> barely

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
one two that's it I'm done I've barely

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.589 
one two that's it I'm done I've barely
left<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.370> curb<00:03:54.609> side<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> maximum

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
left the curb side and the maximum

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.710 
left the curb side and the maximum

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
steering on the steering wheel now

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.789 
steering on the steering wheel now
looking<00:03:58.720> for<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> curb<00:03:59.199> to<00:03:59.410> come<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.680> under

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
looking for the curb to come in under

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.189 
looking for the curb to come in under
the<00:04:00.010> mirror<00:04:00.190> there<00:04:00.669> it<00:04:00.790> is

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
the mirror there it is

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.439 
the mirror there it is
hand<00:04:02.199> brake<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.829> I'm<00:04:03.129> done<00:04:03.310> into<00:04:04.090> reverse

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
hand brake on and I'm done into reverse

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.990 
hand brake on and I'm done into reverse
watching<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> steering<00:04:05.889> again<00:04:06.129> now<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.940> I'm

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
watching the steering again now so I'm

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.970 
watching the steering again now so I'm
steering<00:04:07.389> to<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.629> left<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.079> time<00:04:08.349> so<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.650> left

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
and I'm done using this method will

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.990 
and I'm done using this method will
allow<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.830> complete<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:49.160> turn<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> road

maneuver in narrower roads than you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.800 
maneuver in narrower roads than you
would<00:04:53.510> think<00:04:53.540> usually<00:04:54.200> you'd<00:04:54.530> be<00:04:54.740> able<00:04:54.889> to

would think usually you'd be able to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.879 
would think usually you'd be able to
even<00:04:56.810> when<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:56.990> comes<00:04:57.139> to<00:04:57.260> your<00:04:57.350> driving<00:04:57.740> test

even when it comes to your driving test

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.219 
even when it comes to your driving test
it<00:04:58.220> doesn't<00:04:58.550> matter<00:04:58.700> if<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.970> takes<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.450> three

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
it doesn't matter if it takes you three

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.360 
it doesn't matter if it takes you three
point<00:05:00.560> or<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.770> 5.0<00:05:01.460> even<00:05:01.669> a<00:05:01.729> seven-point<00:05:02.300> turn
