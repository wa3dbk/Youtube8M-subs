00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.350
 after the seventh generation of golf 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 last year here is another icon 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.509
 the 7th golf gti actually volkswagen in 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.820
 offers from the outset two versions one gti 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.800
 normal 220 horsepower and a version 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 230 horsepower performance 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 both using the same 2 liters 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.439
 supercharged all the gti are entitled to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 fog lights using placed 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 vertically and a red border between 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 the headlights the performance version that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.359
 we try here is recognizing the logo 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 Gti painted in white on the front calipers 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 in addition to the 17-inch brakes for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.930
 connoisseurs only so for the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.850
 gt enthusiasts there is an imperative to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.040
 inside find the tiles on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 saddlery exist and we have in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 more optional the edges of seats in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 alcantara customization by 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 compared to other golfs that has some 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.700
 red stitching then had on the steering wheel 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.860
 and a shift knob in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.469
 golf balls but only on the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.350
 mechanical gearbox our gti performance in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 dsg6 box has to go at the back 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 nothing to report except the bench 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.420
 who takes the famous tile 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.830
 generous livability for the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 category as well as the check mark 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 our performance goes from 0 to 100 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 in 6 seconds 4 one tenth less 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 what age is it normal for her age to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 the biggest difference does not come 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.409
 of the chrono but of the present one 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 self-locking on the performance version 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 this allows a better motor skills in 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 turn exit in both versions 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.490
 the sound worked is rather 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 nice our pavement version 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 huge 19-inch wheels went 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 shown very dynamic but too 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.450
 uncomfortable on degraded pavement leads 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.750
 piloted suspension the series mounts 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.100
 17 inches more reasonable 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.020
 for the rest the dsg box always does 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.820
 wonder even if the prices here coni 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.440
 in boots val at the headdress I was 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.210
 expensive no less than thirty-two 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.490
 thousand euros and 1000 more for the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.410
 performance version in return she 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.270
 the luxury of staying under the 140 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.700
 grams per km of co2 in these two 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.360
 variants 220 or 230 horses in a box 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.250
 mechanical 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.050
 this new generation of golf gti 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.759
 therefore progresses both in performance 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.159
 in behavior and consumption 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.229
 but there is no break in 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.580
 real astonishment this gti very 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.580
 rational is also wolf
