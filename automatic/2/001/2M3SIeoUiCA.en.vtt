00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
to do is this screw threaded gutter

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.290 
to do is this screw threaded gutter
anchor<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:17.530> came<00:01:17.920> with<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.159> square<00:01:18.640> drive<00:01:18.970> bit

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
anchor it came with a square drive bit

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.090 
anchor it came with a square drive bit
on<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.570> top<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.590> get<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> right

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
on the top so you have to get the right

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.440 
on the top so you have to get the right
type<00:01:21.610> of<00:01:21.640> bit<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.979> itself<00:01:24.400> what<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.300> do

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
type of bit for the to itself what I do

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.649 
type of bit for the to itself what I do
is<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.870> get<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.170> started<00:01:26.650> into<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.540> under<00:01:28.540> the
