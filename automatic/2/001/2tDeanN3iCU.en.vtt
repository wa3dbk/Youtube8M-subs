00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
up against the linebacker which is a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
up against the linebacker which is a
great<00:02:12.690> thing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
great thing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
great thing
but<00:02:14.480> they<00:02:15.480> didn't<00:02:16.080> quite<00:02:16.440> run<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.430> play<00:02:17.730> as

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
but they didn't quite run the play as

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.420 
but they didn't quite run the play as
they<00:02:18.690> had<00:02:18.930> designed<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:20.069> here

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
they had designed as you can see here

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.720 
they had designed as you can see here
the<00:02:21.390> design<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.020> play<00:02:22.230> was<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.730> Brandon

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the design of the play was that Brandon

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.300 
the design of the play was that Brandon
Marshall<00:02:24.180> would<00:02:24.330> run<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.989> rubber<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.800> which<00:02:26.130> is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
Marshall would run a rubber out which is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.100 
Marshall would run a rubber out which is
essentially<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> pic<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.630> they<00:02:27.750> were<00:02:27.810> trying

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
essentially a pic that they were trying

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.930 
essentially a pic that they were trying
to<00:02:28.230> run<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.910> rookie<00:02:30.540> Colts<00:02:31.140> linebacker

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
to run on a rookie Colts linebacker

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.110 
to run on a rookie Colts linebacker
Jerrell<00:02:32.940> Freeman<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.099> have<00:02:35.250> forte

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
Jerrell Freeman so you have forte

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.170 
Jerrell Freeman so you have forte
against<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.690> rookie<00:02:37.110> linebacker<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.760> single

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
against a rookie linebacker and a single

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
against a rookie linebacker and a single
high<00:02:39.330> safety<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.110> set<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.410> it's

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
high safety in this set so it's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.979 
high safety in this set so it's
essentially<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.970> taken<00:02:42.330> catch<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:42.780> ball

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
essentially if for taken catch this ball

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.110 
essentially if for taken catch this ball
and<00:02:43.319> Marshall<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.830> execute<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.489> small<00:02:44.790> rub

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
and Marshall can execute the small rub

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.070 
and Marshall can execute the small rub
on<00:02:46.069> Freeman<00:02:47.069> its<00:02:47.880> Forte<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.720> man<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
beat in 97 yards to go it's a great look

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.870 
beat in 97 yards to go it's a great look
and<00:02:52.950> they<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.390> can't<00:02:55.049> get<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.410> right

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and they just can't get it right

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.420 
and they just can't get it right
Marshall<00:02:57.019> doesn't<00:02:58.019> get<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.470> right<00:02:58.680> depth<00:02:59.130> on

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
Marshall doesn't get the right depth on

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.800 
Marshall doesn't get the right depth on
this<00:03:00.269> play<00:03:00.980> Freeman<00:03:02.239> reading<00:03:03.239> Cutler's<00:03:03.630> eyes

undercuts<00:03:04.769> where<00:03:05.400> Marshall<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.269> Marshalls

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
undercuts where Marshall is so Marshalls
