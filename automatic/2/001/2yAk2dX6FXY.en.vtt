like<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.959> failure<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.950> bench<00:02:13.129> but<00:02:13.370> these

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
like a failure on the bench but these

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.600 
like a failure on the bench but these
lower<00:02:13.940> weight<00:02:14.860> sets<00:02:15.860> are<00:02:16.040> really<00:02:16.310> important

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
lower weight sets are really important

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.880 
lower weight sets are really important
to<00:02:16.640> me<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.330> really<00:02:17.590> fine-tune<00:02:18.590> my

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
to me because I can really fine-tune my

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.309 
to me because I can really fine-tune my
form<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.819> work<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.599> little<00:02:20.810> things<00:02:20.840> and

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
form and work on little things and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.990 
form and work on little things and
sometimes<00:02:21.739> what<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.129> think<00:02:22.370> people<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.760> is

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
sometimes what I think people do is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.479 
sometimes what I think people do is
actually<00:02:23.180> they<00:02:23.450> jump<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.930> 225<00:02:24.470> too<00:02:25.190> quickly

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
actually they jump to 225 too quickly

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.550 
actually they jump to 225 too quickly
and<00:02:25.849> then<00:02:26.299> they<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.480> kind<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.959> spin<00:02:27.409> their

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and then they just kind of spin their

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890 
and then they just kind of spin their
wheels<00:02:27.799> at<00:02:28.010> 225<00:02:28.549> because<00:02:29.000> they<00:02:29.120> never<00:02:29.269> work<00:02:29.629> in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
wheels at 225 because they never work in

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.350 
wheels at 225 because they never work in
the<00:02:30.560> weight<00:02:31.250> ranges<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.930> 185<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.940> 225<00:02:34.940> pounds

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the weight ranges of 185 to 225 pounds

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.629 
the weight ranges of 185 to 225 pounds
on<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.019> bench<00:02:36.499> press<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.279> can't<00:02:37.489> just

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
on the bench press and you can't just

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.489 
on the bench press and you can't just
jump<00:02:37.939> up<00:02:38.120> those<00:02:38.510> 40<00:02:38.930> pounds<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.409> to

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:39.499 
jump up those 40 pounds you have to

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.890 
jump up those 40 pounds you have to
slowly<00:02:39.799> work<00:02:40.579> your<00:02:40.639> way<00:02:40.999> up<00:02:41.029> you<00:02:41.540> got<00:02:41.659> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
slowly work your way up you got to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.000 
slowly work your way up you got to
up<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.170> 2<00:02:42.319> 10<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.980> 15<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.730> 20<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:45.019> only

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
up to 2 10 to 15 to 20 and then only

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.170 
up to 2 10 to 15 to 20 and then only
then<00:02:46.430> may<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.450> join<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> 225-pound<00:02:48.849> club<00:02:49.849> so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
then may you join the 225-pound club so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.809 
then may you join the 225-pound club so
five<00:02:50.599> sets<00:02:50.959> they're<00:02:51.349> really<00:02:52.310> happy<00:02:52.579> with<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
five sets they're really happy with the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.250 
five sets they're really happy with the
way<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.060> those<00:02:53.209> went<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.569> then<00:02:53.629> we<00:02:53.780> moved<00:02:54.019> on

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
way that those went and then we moved on

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.460 
way that those went and then we moved on
over<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.920> slight<00:02:55.489> incline<00:02:56.470> dumbbell

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
over to the slight incline dumbbell

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.170 
over to the slight incline dumbbell
bench<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.159> one<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.370> those<00:02:58.519> gyms

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
bench and this is one of those gyms

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.720 
bench and this is one of those gyms
where<00:02:59.390> they<00:02:59.510> only<00:02:59.659> have<00:02:59.989> an<00:03:00.280> incline<00:03:01.280> bench

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
where they only have an incline bench

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.429 
where they only have an incline bench
that<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> little<00:03:02.329> bit<00:03:02.480> too<00:03:02.840> high<00:03:03.079> for<00:03:03.319> me<00:03:03.409> I

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
that is a little bit too high for me I

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.050 
that is a little bit too high for me I
feel<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.799> lame<00:03:04.069> or<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.489> shoulder<00:03:04.849> so<00:03:05.030> I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
feel it lame or in my shoulder so I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.309 
feel it lame or in my shoulder so I
don't<00:03:05.269> know<00:03:05.359> if<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.510> guys<00:03:05.629> saw<00:03:05.689> when<00:03:06.019> I<00:03:06.049> showed

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
don't know if you guys saw when I showed

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.470 
don't know if you guys saw when I showed
that<00:03:06.349> clip<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.980> had<00:03:07.340> something<00:03:07.609> underneath<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
that clip I had something underneath the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.780 
that clip I had something underneath the
front<00:03:08.689> of<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.439> incline<00:03:09.920> bench<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.579> of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
front of this incline bench and that of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.300 
front of this incline bench and that of
course<00:03:10.870> lessens<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> incline<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:13.159> feel

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
course lessens the incline and I feel

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.210 
course lessens the incline and I feel
like<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.849> just<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:14.540> perfect<00:03:14.840> angle<00:03:15.829> for

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
like this is just the perfect angle for

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.869 
like this is just the perfect angle for
me<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.359> hit<00:03:17.510> that<00:03:17.659> upper<00:03:18.319> portion<00:03:19.159> of<00:03:19.190> my<00:03:19.400> chest

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
me to hit that upper portion of my chest

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.390 
me to hit that upper portion of my chest
I<00:03:20.000> feel<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.180> really<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.989> nice<00:03:21.400> contraction

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I feel a really really nice contraction

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.440 
I feel a really really nice contraction
right<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:22.849> that's<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.060> something<00:03:23.209> you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
right there so that's just something you

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.849 
right there so that's just something you
guys<00:03:23.659> can<00:03:23.840> try<00:03:24.049> out<00:03:24.079> if<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:24.470> only<00:03:24.590> have<00:03:24.829> a

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
guys can try out if you only have a

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.190 
guys can try out if you only have a
incline<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.000> feel<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:26.450> little<00:03:26.720> too<00:03:26.870> steep

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
incline you feel it's a little too steep

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.929 
incline you feel it's a little too steep
put<00:03:27.530> something<00:03:27.799> under<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.069> front<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.430> lean

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
put something under the front of it lean
