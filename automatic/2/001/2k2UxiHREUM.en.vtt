confuse ourselves about that the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.400 
confuse ourselves about that the
question<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.390> be<00:01:43.480> extrapolated<00:01:44.260> or

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
question is can it be extrapolated or

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.340 
question is can it be extrapolated or
does<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.800> represent<00:01:45.070> cyclic<00:01:45.790> variation<00:01:49.350> what

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
does it represent cyclic variation what

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.110 
does it represent cyclic variation what
the<00:01:50.500> books<00:01:50.740> fail<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.220> mention<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.880> as

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
the books fail to mention is that as

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.840 
the books fail to mention is that as
soon<00:01:52.150> as<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.510> rains<00:01:52.720> came<00:01:53.050> back<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.490> average

no<00:01:57.130> net<00:01:57.370> evolution<00:01:58.060> what<00:01:58.930> we're<00:01:59.110> really

no net evolution what we're really

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.580 
no net evolution what we're really

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.640
