00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
tender and by the way I've also chipped

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.690 
tender and by the way I've also chipped
it<00:02:48.590> once<00:02:48.739> or<00:02:48.890> twice<00:02:48.920> during<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> cooking<00:02:49.610> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.000 
make sure it didn't run out of water and
it<00:02:50.959> didn't<00:02:51.140> turn<00:02:51.230> out<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.440> breath<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.890> it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
it didn't turn out of breath and it

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.860 
it didn't turn out of breath and it
didn't<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:53.180> can<00:02:53.300> see<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.570> Fork<00:02:53.810> is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
didn't and you can see that Fork is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.870 
didn't and you can see that Fork is
sinking<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:54.410> nicely<00:02:54.590> now<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.670> that's

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
sinking in there nicely now so that's

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.150 
sinking in there nicely now so that's
done<00:02:56.200> we're<00:02:57.200> gonna<00:02:57.290> drain<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:59.950> then<00:03:00.950> leave

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
done we're gonna drain it and then leave

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.860 
done we're gonna drain it and then leave
it<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> pan<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.730> it's<00:03:02.060> sort<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.300> evaporates

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
it in the pan so it's sort of evaporates

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.390 
it in the pan so it's sort of evaporates
any<00:03:03.110> moisture<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.590> left<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
any moisture that's left on it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.740 
any moisture that's left on it
so<00:03:04.489> I've<00:03:04.610> drained<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.030> liquid<00:03:05.330> but<00:03:05.540> as<00:03:05.630> you

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
so I've drained the liquid but as you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.090 
so I've drained the liquid but as you
can<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:05.900> it's<00:03:06.140> still<00:03:06.320> quite<00:03:06.500> hot<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.709> steamy

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
can see it's still quite hot and steamy

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.949 
can see it's still quite hot and steamy
I'm<00:03:07.340> gonna<00:03:07.549> leave<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.150> while<00:03:08.840> we

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
I'm gonna leave that in this while we

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.470 
I'm gonna leave that in this while we
start<00:03:09.170> our<00:03:09.260> sauce<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.739> let<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.480> finish

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
start our sauce to let that finish

cooking it's quite quite cooked well
enough<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:13.549> just<00:03:13.670> it'll<00:03:13.910> help<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.269> evaporate

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
enough but just it'll help to evaporate

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.240 
enough but just it'll help to evaporate
something<00:03:15.019> lighter<00:03:15.170> often<00:03:15.560> right<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.160> this

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.670 
stir everything together to come back so
you<00:04:11.489> can<00:04:11.610> see<00:04:11.819> that<00:04:12.000> started<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.480> boil<00:04:12.689> over<00:04:13.019> my

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
you can see that started to boil over my

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.390 
you can see that started to boil over my
medium-high<00:04:14.129> heat

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
medium-high heat

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.460 
medium-high heat
so<00:04:15.120> I'm<00:04:15.180> gonna<00:04:15.299> turn<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.599> down<00:04:15.689> to<00:04:15.840> low<00:04:15.870> oven

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
so I'm gonna turn it down to low oven

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.259 
so I'm gonna turn it down to low oven
for<00:04:16.620> 10<00:04:16.919> minutes<00:04:19.489> now<00:04:20.489> while<00:04:20.639> our<00:04:20.669> sauce<00:04:21.060> is

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
simmering just check that all the liquid

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.360 
simmering just check that all the liquid
is<00:04:23.910> gone<00:04:24.060> out<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.600> pan<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:26.160> we're<00:04:26.280> just

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
is gone out of this pan and we're just

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.920 
is gone out of this pan and we're just
gonna<00:04:26.520> fork<00:04:26.910> mash<00:04:27.150> kind<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> flour

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
gonna fork mash kind of flour

with<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.789> fork<00:04:33.030> until<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.389> hit<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.690> piece

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
with the fork until I hit this piece

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.840 
with the fork until I hit this piece
here<00:04:34.350> so<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.620> may<00:04:34.860> have<00:04:35.070> just<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.400> bit<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.610> core
