00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.760
 Jamie, now from 180 meters. 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.760
 - Ready? - Shoot without order. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.200
 Okay. 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.160
 Jamie, ready to dodge, 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.320
 he waits for the escape flame to be seen after Adam's shot, 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.680
 which will launch the paintball gun 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.880
 230 milliseconds later. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.320
 But when it happens, only Adam knows. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.480
 - I got it? - Yes. Give me a second. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.440
 Jamie could clearly see the exit flame, 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 but he barely moved before the time ran out 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.680
 and paintball shot in his cage. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.080
 Undeterred, Jamie tries a few more times. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.360
 But in vain. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.200
 Cholera. 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.880
 I saw a flash from a distance of 180 meters. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 I reacted and began to get out of his path, 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.000
 but I was not fast enough. 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.320
 Given that the result of the fastest human reaction 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.360
 it's 490 milliseconds, 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.240
 an attempt to avoid a shot from 180 meters in 230 milliseconds 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 looks like a superhuman feat. 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 The myth looks completely overthrown, 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 but we are too far to give up. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080
 We will switch to the Hollywood flame. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.120
 - I saw him. - I saw. 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.520
 We will move the gun to 365 meters, 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.320
 which will give us 500 milliseconds to get out of the way 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.520
 and we'll see if the ball can theoretically be avoided. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.360
 The distance from which I will shoot Jamie, 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 I love this sentence, it's 365 meters. 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.280
 That's the minimum amount of time Jamie and his good reflexes need, 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.200
 to get out of the way on time. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.800
 For a chance, I'll use a full Hollywood flame, 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.520
 which is brighter than the actual sniper round. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.400
 I am ready. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.680
 - Shoot without order. - It's done. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.840
 He hit me. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 That's not what Jamie wanted to do, 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.640
 but he will not give up without a fight. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 Okay, Adam, shoot without order. 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.560
 He hit me again. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.400
 A very long fight. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.520
 With every shot ... 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.040
 Jamie is making progress by perfecting her technique. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.040
 Was close. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 But he does not perfect her enough. 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.880
 Will Adam cope better? 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.240
 - Do you want to try? - Sure! 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 Adam, composed like a panther, 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.080
 he gives Jamie a sign and ... 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.040
 he is hit in a cage 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.320
 once in a while. 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.120
 It's interesting. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960
 We have 500 milliseconds from 365 meters 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.520
 to react and leave the road, it should be enough time, 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.760
 but there is a difference 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 between a workshop trial and a trial in the real world. 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 In the workshop, we have very bright light in front of our eyes. 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.320
 In the real world, we have a small dot 365 meters away. 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920
 It's harder to see her. 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.000
 Now we will move this dot to 457 meters, 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 I will give Jamie more time to react 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.840
 and we will see if it will meet expectations. 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 Shoot without order. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 I avoided her! 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 Finally from 457 meters 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.000
 Hyneman is doing his best dodge with the Matrix, 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.680
 and paintball goes next. 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.120
 But considering the status of the myth, he is not impressed. 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.920
 The test showed that I could escape the bullet. 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.160
 But the matter is. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.200
 We use Hollywood blanks. 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.240
 and if we used real cartridges, 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.440
 I would not see anything 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.840
 and I would be killed. 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.960
 Jamie is right. 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.120
 You can avoid it 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.960
 unrealistically bright Hollywood round, 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.160
 but there is only one application in the real world. 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.800
 - What's the verdict? - The myth is overthrown. 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.640
 There is no way you can avoid a sniper shot. 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.640
 Everything in their equipment, 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.160
 including crutches, it is made to hide. 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.640
 There is no way you can see shots from such a distance, 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.360
 which will give you the chance to avoid getting hit. 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 - Deposed. - I agree, it's overthrown. 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.640
 Let's go. 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.000
 Could you point her in a different direction?
