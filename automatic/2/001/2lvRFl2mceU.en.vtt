00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.150
 who could not miss this fear, huh? 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.969
 if you thought a recipe was right 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 people I made a recipe for another old self 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.420
 I do not like to make prescriptions much 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.420
 because I do not know how to cook very well 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.820
 Very well, but I love making candy and me. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.590
 I like to score said he hoped alone 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 You know things as soon as you feel like it. 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 I will never eat again and who will 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 Diet, you certainly did not click on it. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 video predicts 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 It's these things that I do not like then 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.530
 I'll talk a lot because I'm already going there. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.809
 pick up a document that while you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.809
 see the step by step there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 good mood this is for the respect that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 I'll wear and put a cup full 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.520
 I also put a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 cup almost full of sugar one 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.039
 a little less than a cup and I did it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.500
 this mix since 2000 gradients and 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.750
 I also placed with a box almost 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 filled with condensed milk, I just 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.049
 had taken a little bit then you can 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 consider a full box ok or 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.750
 palatine also gives you the same 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.030
 From now on, just mix and mix this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 mass move move move move enough 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 stir well until we had one point 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 sweet spot that I like when he 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.259
 It takes a little while to purge the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 spoon knows 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.240
 well, that's just people putting the pots 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.159
 that we will put or if you went 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 roll made 12 a little bit harder 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 put the pans I 'd rather feel 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.630
 duckling and we spend all 12 whole 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 clay for the ducklings yes we have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.700
 It's ready and this is just filling all the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.640
 little pots that we want 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.390
 and take the fridge good to leave 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.829
 refrigerator 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.409
 This is the hardest part of my life. 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.539
 opinion that is to wait for the ice cream 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.130
 I like crispy bacon so the pasta 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:06.039
 becomes more homogeneous as genetic and I 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.440
 I really like it so I left three hours. 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:15.330
 in the refrigerator and attack two 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.330
 it stays that way and it's just competitive eating 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.840
 values ​​very easy to find a very 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.310
 Easy neither going to the fire kind of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.650
 I'm just going to leave it to you as you have 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.590
 insistence he was very tough I 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:38.629
 O taste so beneficial knows he is one 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.629
 Shorty I prefer this way 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.569
 I prefer like this 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.310
 if you prefer a little more 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.019
 Just go back a little bit more than 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.969
 condensed milk if you prefer a 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.269
 A little bit harder to wrap up is 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.980
 you put more milk is the milk 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.389
 nest and a little more sugar 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.569
 anyway what advise 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.489
 You're mixing people, these three. 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.680
 ingredients milk neither sugar and milk 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.419
 condensed to what is the super indigo 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.120
 also confectioner's sugar I used 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:14.129
 that one on the mouse than normal and it stays 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.599
 because it was so corn sugar is normal but 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.579
 if you use it it was not 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.680
 punished so one more tip 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.689
 so this is it but now I expect many 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.280
