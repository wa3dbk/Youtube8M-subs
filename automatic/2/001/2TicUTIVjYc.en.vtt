00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.029
 saleh all so tonight I'm going to prepare 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 a salad a bit like a Caesar salad 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.389
 but so have a little it will be a bit of a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.620
 invention knowing that I have to make a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 diet salad 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.830
 so that's why it will be a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.609
 invention so I cut some salad 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 that I washed I'll put it in the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.910
 bottom of my cup salad bowl in two 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:39.600
 when it's big flaws like 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:41.969
 this one so I run like this and that's it 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 so I put this head already in my 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 salad bowl then I pulled out a little bit of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.530
 white chicken I'm going to cook 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.879
 in the pan 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 I will definitely put some 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 game certainly put a little surimi 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 with then we have while montblanc du 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.290
 chicken is cooking I'm going 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.290
 cut into pieces of smi 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.020
 so here I am listening in circles 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.420
 like that because I like to mix 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.600
 grid and so I'm going to grill a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 little in the pan with very very little 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.350
 fat or not at all if 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.850
 possible I'm going to cook in the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.750
 little book that I put to do 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 cook my chicken 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.970
 Then at lunch I cooked the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.100
 white of I am leather of the whole heart that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.040
 I put in a little bit of oil 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.210
 of olive with spices and the world is 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.600
 if I'm going to use it to put in 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.600
 my room to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.830
 so then I'm going to put trauma 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.570
 I have fire I'm doing your lines so 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.170
 it was not to find very much better 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.820
 was worth doing it's just like I 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.550
 do not eat much of my days 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.890
 that I really eat with the minimum of 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.440
 fat and calories 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.420
 I allow myself to eat a little bit of 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.100
 cheese from time to time because I 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.720
 lose weight even while eating it's 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:03:05.590
 just that I will lose some may be a little 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:09.540
 less quickly the shot in small tubes and I 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.540
 put it everywhere on my salad 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.790
 my chicken is cooked I will cut it in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.790
 slices like this 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.940
 so I will try not to overdo it 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.940
 the occasion my nickname 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.770
 I will add it to my salad so here we go 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.120
 I slightly grilled Monfrini I 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.120
 go and play it to my salad 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 then I'm going to tomatoes so 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.170
 I will cut tomatoes into pieces 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.360
 so I cut it in two 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
 I take off 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.189
 so here's my salad looks like that 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.839
 now I'm going to start spicy 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.459
 so I do not have salt because the 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:49.419
 spices that I go like these are 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:52.409
 already already there is heaven in it I'm going 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.409
 put some mint 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.069
 I'm going to put a little cumin but that 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.539
 it's really if you like years because 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:10.569
 that all of us do not like cumin so 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:20.439
 to prepare the season I will take 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:23.409
 a little bowl like this I'm going to put 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:31.209
 a spoon below tablespoon oil 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:38.709
 of olive and 2 tablespoons of 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:39.879
 white wine vinegar then 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.499
 seasoning is like you 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.929
 wish you can add what 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:49.110
 you want in I'm going to put a 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:49.110
 very little mustard not much 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.019
 fresh lean cheese then I add 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.029
 fresh lean cheese simply 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.550
 because we have the right to a spoon 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.259
 olive oil soup and that for a 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.679
 flat like that that is for two or three 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.869
 people 

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.699
 it's not enough and to avoid 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:13.499
 to put too much, I put things like 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.639
 that they are not very liquid to be able to 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:20.139
 to be able to have a salad that is not 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:22.689
 not too dry and that's it once 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:26.519
 it's mixing well I'm going to put my 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.519
 cream on my salad 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.590
 so here and then I mix 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:19.700
 I'll add a little cream base 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:21.410
 mick and so that's my salad is ready 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.750
 as you can see she is ready 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:27.500
 to enjoy his first step really well 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.190
 balanced and very very very good good 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.190
 everyone's appetite
