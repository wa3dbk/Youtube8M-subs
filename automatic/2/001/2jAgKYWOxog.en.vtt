00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.200
 We convened this press conference and responded to relevant reports. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.200
 The Justice Party is serious about the content of this report and various speculations. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200
 Anyway, I want to clarify here 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 The Supreme Council of the Party has never decided to remove the position of the Minister of Selangor of Ka Li as the report stated. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 Did not resolve to remove the position of the Minister of Selangor 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 The Supreme Council of the Party was held on January 15, 2014. 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 Discussing various issues that have occurred in Selangor, including what? 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 Selangor commercial license fee starts 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 This we discussed 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 There is also the issue of Selangor water supply restructuring 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 Allow the central government to use the Water Industry Act Article 114 to take over and reorganize the Selangor water supply. We have discussed this. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 To ensure that we do not lose control of the water supply in Selangor 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 The progress of the second Lengyue River water filtration station project, the issue of the relocation of the Yan House, and the issue of salary increases for state legislators, executive councillors, ministers, speaker, and deputy speaker 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 These are the topics we are discussing. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 Because the Supreme Council of the Party did not make a decision to replace the Minister of Selangor 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 Therefore, there is no such thing as the "Sin Chew" report, the international mountain state member Azmin replaces the position of minister 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 Therefore, there is no such thing as the "Sin Chew" report, the international mountain state member Azmin replaces the position of minister 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 The issues related to Selangor that we are discussing are only those that I have just mentioned.
