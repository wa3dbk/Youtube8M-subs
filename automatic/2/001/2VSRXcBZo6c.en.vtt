whole a sale of the g4 is a new model

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.240 
whole a sale of the g4 is a new model
from<00:00:09.660> Pasquini<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.620> builds<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.010> success

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
from Pasquini that builds on the success

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.999 
from Pasquini that builds on the success
of<00:00:11.670> their<00:00:11.820> prosumer<00:00:12.360> machine<00:00:12.630> Bolivia<00:00:13.049> 90<00:00:13.530> but

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
of their prosumer machine Bolivia 90 but

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.410 
of their prosumer machine Bolivia 90 but
it's<00:00:14.160> adding<00:00:14.519> some<00:00:14.730> features<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it's adding some features and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.910 
it's adding some features and
refinements<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> make<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> an<00:00:16.560> even<00:00:16.740> more

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
refinements to make it an even more

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.550 
refinements to make it an even more
capable<00:00:17.369> machine<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> g4<00:00:18.960> comes<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.380> three

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
capable machine so the g4 comes in three

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.109 
capable machine so the g4 comes in three
variations<00:00:19.890> there's<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.699> semi<00:00:20.910> automatic

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
variations there's the semi automatic

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.420 
variations there's the semi automatic
there's<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> semi-automatic<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.130> PID

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
there's a semi-automatic with PID

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
there's a semi-automatic with PID
temperature<00:00:23.730> control<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> an<00:00:25.109> automatic

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
temperature control and an automatic

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
temperature control and an automatic
which<00:00:25.859> allows<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> program<00:00:26.730> shot<00:00:27.119> volumes

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
which allows you to program shot volumes

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.410 
which allows you to program shot volumes
that<00:00:28.109> also<00:00:28.289> has<00:00:28.590> PID<00:00:29.010> temperature<00:00:29.580> control<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
that also has PID temperature control so

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
that also has PID temperature control so
we've<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> gist<00:00:31.230> based<00:00:31.470> semi-automatic

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
we've got the gist based semi-automatic

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.430 
we've got the gist based semi-automatic
here<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.149> automatic<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.050> PID

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
here and the automatic with the PID

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
here and the automatic with the PID
temperature<00:00:34.980> control<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.239> let's<00:00:36.420> take<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> look

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
temperature control so let's take a look

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.510 
temperature control so let's take a look
at<00:00:36.960> some<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> changes<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> new<00:00:38.100> g4

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
at some of the changes to the new g4

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580 
at some of the changes to the new g4
versus<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> Libyan<00:00:39.540> 90<00:00:39.870> which<00:00:40.079> Pasquini

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
versus the Libyan 90 which Pasquini

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
versus the Libyan 90 which Pasquini
actually<00:00:41.100> been<00:00:41.219> manufacturing<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> over<00:00:42.270> 15

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
actually been manufacturing for over 15

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
actually been manufacturing for over 15
years<00:00:42.780> yes<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.920> looking<00:00:44.250> around<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> outside

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
years yes so looking around the outside

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.950 
years yes so looking around the outside
the<00:00:45.090> first<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> notice

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the first thing you're going to notice

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
the first thing you're going to notice
is<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.340> steam<00:00:47.700> valve<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.809> hot

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is that the steam valve and the hot

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
is that the steam valve and the hot
water<00:00:49.200> valve<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.770> controlled<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> lever

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
water valve are controlled with a lever

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.510 
water valve are controlled with a lever
so<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> push<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> steam<00:00:52.920> lever<00:00:53.190> gives

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so a push up on the steam lever gives

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.610 
so a push up on the steam lever gives
you<00:00:53.760> constant<00:00:54.360> steam<00:00:54.690> push<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you constant steam push down on that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
you constant steam push down on that
same<00:00:55.949> lever<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.000> momentary<00:00:57.660> steam

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
same lever and you get momentary steam

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.130 
same lever and you get momentary steam
the<00:00:58.770> hot<00:00:58.920> water<00:00:59.219> level<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> momentary<00:01:00.629> only

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the hot water level is momentary only

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
the hot water level is momentary only
you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.410> push<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> have

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you can push it up or down but you have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
you can push it up or down but you have
to<00:01:03.120> hold<00:01:03.390> its<00:01:03.600> keep<00:01:03.809> water<00:01:04.049> flowing<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to hold its keep water flowing on the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190 
to hold its keep water flowing on the
inside<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.119> big<00:01:06.270> change<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.110> an

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
inside the big change is that there's an

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
inside the big change is that there's an
actively<00:01:07.619> heated<00:01:08.010> group<00:01:08.220> head<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.030> Olivia

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
actively heated group head the Olivia

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
actively heated group head the Olivia
90s<00:01:09.720> group<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.260> passively<00:01:10.830> heated<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
90s group had was passively heated and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760 
90s group had was passively heated and
on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> g4<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.780> group<00:01:12.990> head<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.350> its<00:01:13.530> own

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
on the g4 the group head has its own

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
on the g4 the group head has its own
thermostatically-controlled<00:01:14.990> dedicated

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
thermostatically-controlled dedicated

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
thermostatically-controlled dedicated
heating<00:01:16.320> element<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> should<00:01:17.610> provide

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
heating element so this should provide

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.969 
heating element so this should provide
better<00:01:18.119> temperature<00:01:18.570> stability<00:01:18.979> resulting

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
better temperature stability resulting

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
better temperature stability resulting
in<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.340> consistency<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.119> espresso<00:01:21.390> brewing

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in more consistency and espresso brewing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
in more consistency and espresso brewing
as<00:01:22.229> well<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.650> shorter<00:01:23.189> ready<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> brew<00:01:23.729> times

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
as well as shorter ready to brew times

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.600 
as well as shorter ready to brew times
another<00:01:24.930> notable<00:01:25.409> internal<00:01:26.040> change<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
another notable internal change is a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.300 
another notable internal change is a
repositioning<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> machines<00:01:27.900> brains<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
repositioning of the machines brains the

repositioning of the machines brains the
electronic<00:01:29.790> control<00:01:30.240> boards<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.810> been

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
electronic control boards have been

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
electronic control boards have been
moved<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> bottom<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> machine<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
moved to the bottom of the machine and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.149 
moved to the bottom of the machine and
away<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.360> heat<00:01:33.810> sources<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
away from heat sources you know of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
away from heat sources you know of
course<00:01:35.280> electronics<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.090> fare<00:01:36.479> well<00:01:36.509> in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
course electronics don't fare well in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
course electronics don't fare well in
high<00:01:37.049> temperatures<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.189> moving<00:01:38.460> them<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
high temperatures so moving them to a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.660 
high temperatures so moving them to a
cooler<00:01:39.000> area<00:01:39.360> should<00:01:39.840> improve<00:01:40.170> reliability

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
cooler area should improve reliability

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.920 
cooler area should improve reliability
there's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.759> slight<00:01:42.030> trade-off<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
there's a slight trade-off and at the

the<00:03:01.490> libya<00:03:01.820> 90<00:03:02.209> yeah<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.630> think<00:03:02.750> solids<00:03:03.260> a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
the libya 90 yeah I think solids a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.750 
the libya 90 yeah I think solids a
really<00:03:03.590> good<00:03:03.740> way<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.920> put<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.370> when<00:03:04.670> you

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
really good way to put it when you

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.880 
really good way to put it when you
compare<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.270> libyan<00:03:05.600> 90<00:03:05.959> side<00:03:06.260> by<00:03:06.440> side<00:03:06.680> with

the g4 the quality of the components are

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.990 
the g4 the quality of the components are
bumped<00:03:09.709> up<00:03:09.830> by<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.070> couple<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.490> really<00:03:10.700> big
