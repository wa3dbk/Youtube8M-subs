00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello to all that so welcome to a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200
 new video and undertook a capturing 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.170
 as quickly as possible because they look like 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 you are watching everything on my television not 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.049
 it is said to me tele or is the play I think 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 which is more the play or problem of which 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.240
 I'm not sure, but look here 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.480
 below the score counters then 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.330
 it looks all bad I hope it is not the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 core video card something that is 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 about to break down but good 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.470
 It caught quite the attention because 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 on the map it does not indicate anything for more than 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.750
 moves do not shoot the enemies do not I 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.219
 indicates there is one also kill him and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 we can play 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.469
 let's play there's no fuck I got shot 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 and they almost killed me and it can be first 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.850
 capture now to record this game 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.290
 because it made me very very strange how 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 you started watching the game and here they are 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.700
 his whole body is bloodied by 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.440
 two that must be an infected today if 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.150
 it seems that they were infected in the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.390
 first time I see something like that and well another 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.390
 more while taking this son of fruit 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.190
 clear but they are everywhere and already 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.570
 I have little life left so I have to 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.030
 run here 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.640
 I do not have medicine cabinets in fact 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.180
 happily first capturing and I'm 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.409
 recording this because it's very well weird 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.119
 the whole body of my enemies was 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.740
 bloody and it gives the impression of 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 that we are when against 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 infected 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.799
 and even the symbol that you have to open 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.750
 the boxes looks pretty pixelated like that 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.270
 that I'm going to take to record everything 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.299
 possible because I believe that in any 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.450
 moment is going to hang play 3 and now 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.190
 I would like you to tell me here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.200
 down in the comments if it is that you 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.970
 something like this has happened, this is the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 the first time I see my enemies 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.800
 playing so dirty gives the impression that 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.200
 were infected and it's one of the things 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.750
 that I would have liked a lot and that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.190
 I hope you put it in the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.470
 multiplayer of the last of us 2 for 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.569
 play 4 imagine being in a team 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.060
 deathmatch and fall down looters there 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.610
 or infected of which be careful 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.260
 or better yet hordes of infected playing 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 in cooperative mode be 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.900
 very good to play with your friends and here 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.209
 it is here is here they will see see 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.310
 I hope to kill him and we finish him 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.049
 shooting there is one out there that is with 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.480
 This rifle like this I'm going to 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.739
 start bad truth in me the wall or 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.500
 little by little everything looks really weird 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.790
 you're not going to achieve it's play please still 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.850
 is not what I was saying, do not tell me 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.310
 I hate the rifle a lot 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.220
 I get the feeling that these babies 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.780
 they stay there as I'm changing, look 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 well although I think that this one did not have the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.130
 rifle had the bursts since there is another 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.270
 step but this one we're going to kill him with 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.070
 this beautiful to kill the one that most 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.710
 that I am please I did not give him and there are two 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.920
 I think I went to the mouth of the wolf 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.010
 so happily my pump finished it 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.990
 but I keep 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.610
 he could not give him good 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.670
 behind me not 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.130
 I was lucky that my team came to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 help me because I already felt that I was a man 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.460
 dead and keeps shooting me this is a 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.880
 zombie or who never dies 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.160
 marine kill it marine is blacklist 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.920
 brunette you listen to me 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.540
 all are stained with blood what 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.590
 effect touches the flesh here for all 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.100
 and I thought only my enemies but 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.330
 even my colleagues are mutating everything 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.330
 his body is dirty 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.730
 if it looks pretty weird look at the wall in 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.200
 the Little Red Riding Hood but the machine 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.400
 that have it super clean is not 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 stain for nothing 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.239
 asÃ³mate to his mate although kill it 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.190
 prefer marena if here I hope 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.170
 Do not come back because if you come 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.860
 let's open the two together and that's what 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.810
 I do not want 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.810
 We are winning by losing it does not leave me 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.180
 even see these things that stain the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.080
 law when it stains the play screen or 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.180
 I do not know what to say I'm very surprised 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.919
 for what I'm looking at it seems to me that 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.659
 it's kind of funny but I think 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.789
 which is the most of all is though not 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:49.240
 I should sing victory because it would be very 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:53.139
 sad and sad 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.340
 that my beautiful lawsuit is 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:01.889
 starting to achieve communion and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.810
 there just to the front kill what yes 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.629
 there is a question that I ask myself is this 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.909
 only I will be seeing this or all 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.770
 my classmates will also see it I do not have 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.900
 to anyone who is playing with me and has 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.529
 the mic to ask him there is this 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.340
 way I'm going to cure it yes yes although I have 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.639
 one in front who is waiting for me 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.340
 I encourage you to come right, we are good 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.639
 three against one until we both do not 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.100
 saw that but to study called game of 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.710
 good equipment and extras when as 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.389
 sand is that I'm going to ask 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.310
 ask if she also saw the 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.550
 strange half game or it's just me or 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.210
 it's just my play in this execution area 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.510
 with daggers but already enough time that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.510
 he left 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.150
 and weird things always happen in the 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.010
 Astro favor I have seen images of people 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.540
 public that the 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.030
 backpacks to me I never appreciate the 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.040
 backpack but I have seen that it changes the 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.650
 color also to your backpack and also the 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.580
 color to suit that's what I think 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.960
 is happening 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.150
 happily I had the capturing 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.560
 connected and I'm just have a 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.210
 good game so I'm going to upload this 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.670
 video to the channel to share this 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.480
 moment with all of you and I hope so 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.950
 I like this video and it gives me the 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.100
 impression that this item was already 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.550
 to finish and I just finish up and well 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:29.180
 not yellow once 90 I think it was 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.220
 a very good game so good 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.680
 friends up here is going to get this video 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.450
 I hope you liked it and do not forget 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.760
 mention I'll take the comments 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.200
 that you have something like this happened to them 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.690
 another strange thing that happened to me was that a 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.280
 more time with dagger to an enemy and I stayed 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.260
 all the time with the in hand up 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.330
 they killed me and then because he let go 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.190
 if in case the same thing would happen to me again 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.130
 I will take advantage to make a new video 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.320
 Now I say goodbye, take care of yourself a lot and 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.590
 see you until next time 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.590
 goodbye
