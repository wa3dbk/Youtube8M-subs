00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.640
 Greetings have everyone once again from 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.869
 now to investigate aragua pr talks to them 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.210
 as always eric martínez host 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.700
 this time we will make an intervention for 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.570
 who if they are going to approach the planet 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.570
 mercury 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 something that surprised us a lot when 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.630
 We knew lavat and sure we did not know 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 really now those who do not know what 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 is through mercury where is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.880
 located 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.880
 this beta mercury is this part 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.670
 at that distance from the others near the 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.500
 Sun 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 the mercury planet has its diameter 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:02.469
 44 thousand 800 kilometers with a distance 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.350
 average to the sun of about 58 million 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.700
 kilometer 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.830
 your orbital period 88 days period 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 rotation 58 points 7 days does not have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 no light so those that I liked 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 hard that we are in this couple that 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.030
 portray the moon that becomes romantic 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.690
 that changes moods 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.600
 because that is something that we will talk about in 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.780
 operators or tradition the changes of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 the people and the harsh 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.150
 because on this planet there is no doubt 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.520
 there is no kind of light the planet 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 is smaller than the earth but without 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.310
 larger than our lumens 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 usually mercury considered the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.420
 planet more imperceptible from the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.360
 mercy for its position close to the sun 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.670
 however on January 14 the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.850
 planet will move away from the center of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 galaxy system and it will be visible 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.289
 for all the inhabitants of the planet 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.810
 they listened and we can all appreciate it 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 we can see it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.840
 that day 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.709
 that same day the sun will not be able to eclipse 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.430
 the planet in that way will increase the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.849
 possibility 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.719
 in an absence of its dubious age and 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:33.939
 artificial light sources that will happen 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:37.599
 until January 21, 2015 to spend 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:41.120
 by sanitary to capricorn the two or 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.239
 first three hours of the night 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 as we are going to distinguish it was we are going to 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.580
 locate us where you are 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.489
 well because they are having it as if it were 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 a kind of driving are not having 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.959
 as they had it in 2005 that's something 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.480
 extremely beautiful but to be able 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.489
 distinguish in taking more to see more 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.390
 this is also close to the red planet 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.540
 It is very easy to locate 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 and always remember that a planet does not 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.850
 blinking people who do not know 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.160
 for the clarks to be simply shine 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.270
 Many confuse least jupiter 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.760
 Jupiter is the largest planet in the world 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.120
 solar system therefore it shines 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:33.110
 we both know its brightness by its size 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.379
 and we see it is brighter than seven 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.379
 reasons 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.069
 can distinguish them 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.989
 for that closeness as well as two the no 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.019
 less also that one stays 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.870
 application that I have and forward the 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.010
 time what will happen more or less between 8 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.470
 9 at night 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.330
 in the part that makes 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.100
 well I hope that the video has them 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.850
 liked the information will be updated 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.850
 and subject to change remember that if you 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.620
 like the video a thumbs up thank you 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.050

 all have been welcome from mexico

 thank you for the support you are giving 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.560
 greeting from now to investigate water pr

 I speak to them eddy martínez
