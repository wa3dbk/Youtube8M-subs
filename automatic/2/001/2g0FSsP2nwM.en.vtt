egg<00:00:08.519> minutes<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.000> today<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> got<00:00:10.139> another<00:00:10.320> new

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
egg minutes and today I got another new

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
egg minutes and today I got another new
asset<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> one<00:00:11.870> it's<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:13.019> an

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
asset for you this one it's just an

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
asset for you this one it's just an
experiment<00:00:13.440> sometimes<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.130> interesting

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
experiment sometimes it's interesting

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.140 
experiment sometimes it's interesting
sometimes<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:16.139> interesting<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:17.369> take<00:00:18.029> about

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
sometimes it's interesting to take about

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.910 
sometimes it's interesting to take about
two<00:00:18.359> shapes<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.810> repeat<00:00:19.080> them<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.619> time<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
two shapes and repeat them from time to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
two shapes and repeat them from time to
time<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.189> did<00:00:20.340> sort<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> rounded<00:00:21.270> thing<00:00:21.720> we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
time we did sort of a rounded thing we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.000 
time we did sort of a rounded thing we
called<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> cinnabon<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
called it the cinnabon and it was a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
called it the cinnabon and it was a
little<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.279> fun<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.910> wanted<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> mess

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
little bit fun but I wanted to mess

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560 
little bit fun but I wanted to mess
around<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.380> squares<00:00:26.300> doing<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
around a bit with squares doing kind of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.800 
around a bit with squares doing kind of
a<00:00:27.689> traffic<00:00:28.019> interchange<00:00:28.800> sort<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> setup<00:00:29.810> not

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
a traffic interchange sort of setup not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.060 
a traffic interchange sort of setup not
necessarily<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> most

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
necessarily because it's the most

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.410 
necessarily because it's the most
practical<00:00:32.250> thing<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> world<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.120> because

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
practical thing in the world but because

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.670 
practical thing in the world but because
we<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.690> want<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.930> mess<00:00:34.050> around<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.500> see

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
we just want to mess around and see

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
we just want to mess around and see
what's<00:00:34.860> possible<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> best<00:00:35.640> place<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.969> do

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
what's possible and the best place to do

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850 
what's possible and the best place to do
that<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> asset<00:00:37.140> editor<00:00:37.530> because

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that really is the asset editor because

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.869 
that really is the asset editor because
then<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> worry<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.700> how

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
then you don't have to worry about how

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
then you don't have to worry about how
much<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> cost<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.870> city<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
much it's going to cost your city and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.790 
much it's going to cost your city and
forgetting<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:43.190> save<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:46.559> main

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
forgetting to you know not save the main

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
forgetting to you know not save the main
thing<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.460> aside<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.570> square

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
thing about this aside from the square

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.819 
thing about this aside from the square
and<00:00:49.020> relatively<00:00:50.390> compact<00:00:51.390> set<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.350> there's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and relatively compact set up there's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
and relatively compact set up there's
actually<00:00:53.160> space<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.850> use<00:00:54.000> under

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually space that you can use under

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.340 
actually space that you can use under
here<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.600> were<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> set<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> roads

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
here if you were to set up the roads

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
here if you were to set up the roads
properly<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> wouldn't<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> complete<00:00:56.760> waste

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
properly it wouldn't be a complete waste

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.450 
properly it wouldn't be a complete waste
of<00:00:57.180> space<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:58.379> build<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> found

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
of space to build this but what I found

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.959 
of space to build this but what I found
most<00:00:59.640> interesting<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.710> this<00:01:01.710> sort<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.039> step

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
most interesting was this sort of step

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.280 
most interesting was this sort of step
design<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.809> had<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.549> height<00:01:05.549> raised<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
design we had the height raised on the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
design we had the height raised on the
same<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.250> each<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> squares

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
same side for each of the squares

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
same side for each of the squares
basically<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.500> every

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
basically so as it's going around every

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649 
basically so as it's going around every
time<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> comes<00:01:11.250> around<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> side<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
time it comes around to this side it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
time it comes around to this side it
goes<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.229> step<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.979> goes<00:01:14.189> around

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
goes up one step and then goes around

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
goes up one step and then goes around
and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.820> eventually<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.330> reached<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and then eventually we reached the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
and then eventually we reached the
maximum<00:01:16.049> height<00:01:16.229> oh<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:17.189> dropped<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> back

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
maximum height oh he dropped it back

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.920 
maximum height oh he dropped it back
down<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> ground<00:01:18.210> level<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
down to ground level just to make it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
down to ground level just to make it
easy<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> connect<00:01:19.650> everything<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.310> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
easy to connect everything up but this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
easy to connect everything up but this
shape<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> sort<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> wavy<00:01:22.619> design

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
shape here and sort of the wavy design

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
shape here and sort of the wavy design
and<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> sort<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> shifted<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and the way it sort of shifted just a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.840 
and the way it sort of shifted just a
little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.220> stretched<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
little bit got a little more stretched a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
little bit got a little more stretched a
little<00:01:26.880> bit<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.330> elongated<00:01:27.630> each<00:01:28.229> step<00:01:28.790> even

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
little bit more elongated each step even

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
little bit more elongated each step even
when<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> altitude<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.810> changing<00:01:31.350> by<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
when the altitude is changing by the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590 
when the altitude is changing by the
same<00:01:31.860> amount<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.400> came<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> an

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
same amount it came out to be kind of an

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.380 
same amount it came out to be kind of an
interesting<00:01:33.840> sort<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> shape<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.579> trying<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
interesting sort of shape I'm trying to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
interesting sort of shape I'm trying to
think<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.869> might<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.170> able<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.470> use

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
think of how we might be able to use

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
think of how we might be able to use
this<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.040> future<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.729> some<00:01:39.000> sort<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.240> a

this in the future in some sort of a
design<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.590> improve<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> aesthetics

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
design that would improve the aesthetics

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.740 
design that would improve the aesthetics
of<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.150> city<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.740> main<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.240> that's<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of a city the main thing that's a bit of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
of a city the main thing that's a bit of
a<00:01:45.810> barrier<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.950> posts<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> pillars

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
a barrier is the posts and the pillars

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.609 
a barrier is the posts and the pillars
apparently<00:01:48.659> there's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> mod<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.439> can

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
apparently there's a mod that you can

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
apparently there's a mod that you can
get<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> removes<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> pillars<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
get that removes the pillars from the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.410 
get that removes the pillars from the
roads<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:52.159> some<00:01:53.159> people<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:54.060> okay<00:01:54.210> with

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
roads which some people are okay with

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.389 
roads which some people are okay with
that<00:01:54.689> i'm<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:54.899> sure<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.290> i<00:01:55.470> am<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that i'm not sure that i am just in this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.569 
that i'm not sure that i am just in this
in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.500> general<00:01:58.500> sense<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> things<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> city

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
in the general sense of things in a city

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.010 
in the general sense of things in a city
if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.090> giant<00:02:00.479> roads<00:02:00.689> made<00:02:00.899> out

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
if you have these giant roads made out

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.139 
if you have these giant roads made out
of<00:02:01.140> concrete<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.770> rebar<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.939> there's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
of concrete and rebar and there's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.459 
of concrete and rebar and there's
nothing<00:02:03.270> holding<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.140> collapse

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
nothing holding them up they collapse

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.950 
nothing holding them up they collapse
it's<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.119> getting

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's just kind of the thing so getting

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869 
it's just kind of the thing so getting
rid<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.439> doesn't<00:02:07.770> necessarily<00:02:08.459> suit

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
rid of them doesn't necessarily suit

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.210 
rid of them doesn't necessarily suit
what<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.420> looking<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:11.039> would

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what I'm looking for but it would

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.620 
what I'm looking for but it would
definitely<00:02:11.430> improve

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
definitely improve

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.180 
definitely improve
structures<00:02:13.020> such<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.680> its<00:02:13.980> ability

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
structures such as this and its ability

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.630 
structures such as this and its ability
to<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:15.120> know<00:02:15.240> be<00:02:15.420> visually<00:02:15.750> appealing<00:02:16.020> as

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
to you know be visually appealing as

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.360 
to you know be visually appealing as
always<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.540> only<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.230> interesting<00:02:19.830> until<00:02:20.220> we

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
always it's only so interesting until we

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.090 
always it's only so interesting until we
plug<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> into<00:02:21.330> an<00:02:21.660> actual<00:02:21.810> traffic<00:02:22.320> situation

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
plug it into an actual traffic situation

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.900 
plug it into an actual traffic situation
and<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:23.640> happens<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.850> of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and see what happens and this is kind of

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
and see what happens and this is kind of
what<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> looks<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.450> when<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.140> provide<00:02:31.320> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
what it looks like when you provide it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.320 
what it looks like when you provide it
with<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.770> traffic<00:02:32.250> source<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.940> couple<00:02:33.150> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
with a traffic source and a couple of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.320 
with a traffic source and a couple of
places<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.960> traffic<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.440> go<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:36.060> kind

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
places for the traffic to go it's kind

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.640 
places for the traffic to go it's kind
of<00:02:36.390> interesting<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.470> much

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
of interesting it's not that much

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.990 
of interesting it's not that much
different<00:02:38.010> from<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> circle<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.820> did

different from the circle that we did

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.520 
different from the circle that we did
the<00:02:39.120> traffic<00:02:39.480> goes<00:02:39.660> around<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.200> goes<00:02:40.350> up

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the traffic goes around and it goes up

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.590 
the traffic goes around and it goes up
and<00:02:40.650> then<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.890> goes<00:02:41.010> down<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.060> off<00:02:42.210> ramps

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
and then it goes down the off ramps

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750 
and then it goes down the off ramps
wherever<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.110> wants<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.440> go<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.520> were<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
wherever it wants to go if I were to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.120 
wherever it wants to go if I were to
take<00:02:45.690> something<00:02:45.960> away<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.590> again<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
take something away from this again that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.280 
take something away from this again that
I<00:02:47.160> would<00:02:47.340> want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.580> use<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.420> traffic<00:02:48.720> asset

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I would want to use in a traffic asset

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.890 
I would want to use in a traffic asset
that<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.500> would<00:02:50.190> use<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.460> an<00:02:50.580> actual<00:02:50.850> city<00:02:51.210> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that I would use in an actual city it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.330 
that I would use in an actual city it
would<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.350> wavy<00:02:52.650> thing<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> think<00:02:53.280> I'm

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
would be this wavy thing and I think I'm

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.470 
would be this wavy thing and I think I'm
gonna<00:02:53.430> mess<00:02:53.640> around<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.300> bit

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
gonna mess around with that a little bit

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
gonna mess around with that a little bit
and<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.840> can't<00:02:55.080> come<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.290> with

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and see if I can't come up with
