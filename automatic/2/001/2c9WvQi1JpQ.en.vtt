00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.490
 after training aiming arrow from 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.620
 the gun 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.620
 instructor commander should proceed to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.110
 learning leaked to the descent control MSK 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 keeping the front sight in the area 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.550
 aiming points it is done very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.939
 just the shooter brought the weapon to the area 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 point sighting aimed 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.150
 the commander or instructor imposes 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 finger on finger and index finger in 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:40.010
 an arrow and shows him free play 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 trigger here it is accentuating 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.129
 stop the trigger from the hands of one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 the shooter should not own now 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.100
 move your finger after the command of the commander 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.030
 he should try to squeeze it himself 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 free run 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 Well, squeeze free play here to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 stopos not necessary so smoothly 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.979
 calmly survived after he 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.530
 learned this element 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.990
 commander show how even mother needs 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.810
 trigger 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 due to the fact that if you press wrong 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 on the trigger that is cutting 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.549
 muscle contraction and abnormalities occur 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 significant pistol 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.460
 from the aiming point and that leads to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 miss as a result of this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.680
 the commander must get it right 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.530
 pulling the trigger here already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.900
 easier for the commander to do it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.659
 learning as the shooter already has 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.130
 skills in proper descent control 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:51.119
 when firing from the machine gun and svd free 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.560
 move and now slowly gradually smooth 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:02:01.070
 constantly even toils the trigger 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.070
 once again independently free move 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.069
 there is good at learning shooting with 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:15.040
 places on a fixed target this 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.190
 enough however when shooting 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.030
 speedy 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.150
 removing weapons from the position 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.930
 bent arm or at an angle 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.959
 45 degrees here exists substantially 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.110
 different difference in descent control 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.900
 so the shooter is great or the commander 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.040
 owed exactly in this sequence 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.099
 clarify the plug following what happens when 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 firing when you hover a weapon when 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.329
 rate of fire rubles pointing weapons 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.420
 at the goal 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:54.340
 you must perform the following two 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.560
 a third of the distance to the aiming point 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:04.810
 weapons displayed quickly enough 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.810
 not relaxing your hands fast enough 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.520
 and then slowing down is brought along 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.610
 mashka to aiming point at the moment 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.319
 stop shot is not 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.590
 pull the trigger I'll 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.700
 press and so first 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.730
 quickly 2 3 then bring up and finger already 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.430
 even may trigger at the moment 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.410
 stop going shot again 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.510
 free move immediately you can squeeze 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:50.230
 and then two thirds slowly 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.940
 shot again now self 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.940
 I control you 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.620
 shot a few things the same 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.240
 the shooter must learn to control 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.820
 lowering and shooting with carry 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.530
 several targets as there is 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.610
 significant management complexity 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.700
 descent the first shot is made exactly 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.870
 just like when shooting one at a time 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:32.280
 rate of fire running on one target 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.390
 the rise of troops after the shot was lowered from 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.320
 trigger 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.230
 and we go down a little bit forward and 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.760
 simultaneously carried by the body 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.070
 squeezed out with a short box 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 the next stop is again stopped 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:52.020
 shot the next transfer and again 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.660
 shot 5 skills 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.070
 start-up control should 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:04.470
 work out 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:08.790
 using simulators and combat can 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.810
 training weapon until he 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.020
 will achieve 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.169
 moment when at the moment of clicking on 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:20.130
 trigger and trigger with a 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:27.050
 platoon fly will remain in 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.050
 slots without moving left to right up down
