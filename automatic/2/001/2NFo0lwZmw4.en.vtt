 the successor to the v959 from wl toys what 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.880
 it is amazing to see on the box 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.860
 a 6-axis chiro had a practice 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.259
 it means a very stable flight and 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.300
 regionally controllable quadcopter 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.410
 what's new is the LED lighting both 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.180
 in the front at the back and on the four arms 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.680
 In addition, you will immediately see a number 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.870
 modules available for this 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.300
 quadcopter is included as standard

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.960
 The water blower can give us one 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.609
 shotgun and and rescue's module 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.019
 if just take the back 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.469

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.780
 professional looking channel and that too 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.909
 the quadcopter a plane time of 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.800
 about 8 minutes 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.479
 then you have to call and die 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.400
 separates 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.870
 what immediately stands out is the size of 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.030
 the quadcopter 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.640
 the quadcopter was a diameter of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.439
 about eighteen centimeters quite large 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 ensures a stable flight and 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.610
 pleasant experiences during the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.610
 control 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 as you see in the front at the back 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 LED-lighting 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.399
 at the bottom of the fly arms there is also the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.399
 necessary lighting 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.280
 I also don't do it alone 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.939
 Professional lined also really solid 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.649
 to 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.060
 as jacket can see it is also mindful 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.060
 details 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 Add to grip you can just 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.710
 unfolding in front of them LCD 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.329
 screen with useful information 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.340
 during the flight 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.939
 here you will find the camera control buttons 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.159
 photo 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.159
 the LED lights and the further 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.610
 if death naturally and send 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.400
 like they do the same 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.440
 propellers the quadcopter is very small 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.390
 Asterisks do not need this as quickly 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.810
 have marcel the bowl 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:17.570

 also 220 volt charger camera module 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.810
 This module simply turns black at the bottom 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.700
 the shorter and nice surplus is the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 Dutch manual that you are in 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.540

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.540
 immediately left 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.010
 of course you are not charging faster 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.360
 of the battery these are already in 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.560
 the drone 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.560
 project easily 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.910
 and control easily drives back between 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.489
