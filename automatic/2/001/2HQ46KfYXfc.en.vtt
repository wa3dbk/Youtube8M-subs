a look at some of these specs now I've
seen<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.449> mixed<00:00:30.750> reviews<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.109> this

angle grinder online and a couple of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.900 
angle grinder online and a couple of
them<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> wanted<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> point<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.460> first<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.820> all

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
them I wanted to point out first of all

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
them I wanted to point out first of all
it's<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> four<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> half<00:00:36.600> inch<00:00:36.870> small<00:00:37.200> angle

it's a four and a half inch small angle
grinder<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.340> call<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.730> light

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
grinder I would I would call this light

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.750 
grinder I would I would call this light
duty<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.530> own<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> metal<00:00:41.190> shop<00:00:41.430> or

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
duty if you own a metal shop or

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.680 
duty if you own a metal shop or
something<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.210> where<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:42.660> going

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
something like that where you're going

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
something like that where you're going
to<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.170> feeding<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> snot<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> thing

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to be feeding the snot out of this thing

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
to be feeding the snot out of this thing
I'm<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:45.780> for

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I'm not sure that this is the one for

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.299 
I'm not sure that this is the one for
you<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> probably<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.860> something<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> little

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you I probably go for something a little

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
you I probably go for something a little
heavier<00:00:47.610> duty<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:49.079> something

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
heavier duty but if you want something

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.959 
heavier duty but if you want something
for<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> house<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.489> light

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
for around the house and light

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
for around the house and light
professional<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.219> can

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
professional use I I don't think you can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
professional use I I don't think you can
beat<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.000> far<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.329> value<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.199> concerned

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
beat this as far as value is concerned

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
beat this as far as value is concerned
let's<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
let's take a look at some of the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.560 
let's take a look at some of the
features<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> all<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.440> has<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.100> rotating

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
features first of all it has a rotating

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.380 
features first of all it has a rotating
guard<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.469> rotate<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.010> thing

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
guard on it so you can rotate this thing

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
guard on it so you can rotate this thing
180<00:01:03.390> degrees<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.379> around<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.070> like

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
180 degrees all the way around I like

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.679 
180 degrees all the way around I like
that<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.000> position<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that because you can position that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
that because you can position that
anywhere<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:07.890> easy<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
anywhere you want to it's very easy to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990 
anywhere you want to it's very easy to
do<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.000> read<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.260> guy's<00:01:10.439> review<00:01:10.710> said<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.159> he

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
do I read one guy's review said that he

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.340 
do I read one guy's review said that he
actually<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:12.750> pulled<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
actually when he pulled it out of the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
actually when he pulled it out of the
box<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.159> guard<00:01:14.549> had<00:01:14.760> been<00:01:14.790> installed

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
box the the guard had been installed

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
box the the guard had been installed
totally<00:01:16.380> backwards<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.130> had<00:01:17.220> been<00:01:17.369> punched

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
totally backwards that had been punched

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
totally backwards that had been punched
backwards<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.299> wonder<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.720> he<00:01:18.780> knew<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
backwards I just wonder if he knew that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.149 
backwards I just wonder if he knew that
it<00:01:19.290> rotated<00:01:20.570> secondly<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.140> simple<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it rotated secondly it's very simple to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
it rotated secondly it's very simple to
change<00:01:23.490> wheels<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.200> you're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
change wheels on this thing if you're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
change wheels on this thing if you're
going<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.740> cutting<00:01:26.070> wheel<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> grinding

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
going from a cutting wheel to a grinding

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
going from a cutting wheel to a grinding
wheel<00:01:27.170> literally<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> less

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
wheel literally you can do it in less

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:51.960 
wheel literally you can do it in less
than<00:01:30.180> 30<00:01:30.450> seconds

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.510 

I<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.950> fact<00:01:54.160> that<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.400> has<00:01:54.490> a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
I also like the fact that it has a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.150 
I also like the fact that it has a
locking<00:01:54.850> switch<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.260> not<00:01:56.470> standard<00:01:57.040> on

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
locking switch that is not standard on

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.740 
locking switch that is not standard on
all<00:01:57.190> grinders<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.000> make<00:01:58.180> sure<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.630> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
all grinders so make sure that if you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.530 
all grinders so make sure that if you
need<00:01:58.930> one<00:01:59.350> with<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.530> locking<00:01:59.740> switch<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.850> look

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
need one with a locking switch you look

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.350 
need one with a locking switch you look
for<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.780> feature<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:03.220> also<00:02:03.460> very<00:02:03.820> simple

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
for that feature it's also very simple

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.480 
for that feature it's also very simple
to<00:02:04.810> change<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.350> handle<00:02:05.770> that's<00:02:06.160> another

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
to change the handle that's another

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.190 
to change the handle that's another
great<00:02:06.700> feature<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.780> left<00:02:08.020> or

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
great feature of this it's a left or
