00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
have to apply much pressure to which is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.180 
have to apply much pressure to which is
what<00:03:05.030> i<00:03:05.060> really<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.450> about<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.140> lot<00:03:07.070> of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
what i really like about this a lot of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.270 
what i really like about this a lot of
the<00:03:07.280> pen<00:03:07.459> mouses<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.780> tough<00:03:08.989> click

the pen mouses have a really tough click

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.830 
the pen mouses have a really tough click
so<00:03:10.280> when<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.850> turn<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.600> get<00:03:11.720> this

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
so when you turn it on you get this

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.540 
so when you turn it on you get this
little<00:03:12.110> red<00:03:12.290> light<00:03:12.530> which<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> optical

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
sensor you don't have to use it on the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.470
