00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 a long time ago in a day with nothing to do 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
 I came up with an idea for a video of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.730
 gravity falls looking by tumblr note 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.500
 that many users of the fandom of the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170
 series have been creating different 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 comics fan arts among other things about 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 the series then it occurred to me to make a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.840
 small top titled gravity force top 5 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.519
 of the realities created by the fandom 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.760
 I hope you get comfortable and enjoy 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 of this video to start with this one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.590
 small introduction the realities 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 alternate are those worlds where the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 original story suffered small or 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.950
 big changes returning the different 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.040
 probabilities is really for those 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.780
 worlds the gravity force fandom is very 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 high creative to the point of creating 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.370
 different realities very different from the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920
 series with both dark themes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.379
 obscene and even funny but still with 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.260
 all those changes still leave part of the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.660
 essence of the original series this top 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.149
 will deal with the realities that to my liking 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 they seem more interesting to me so I do not 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 there will be no problem with the fans with 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.400
 everything already cleared 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.560
 let's start with the top position number 5 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.960
 in the fifth place is the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.850
 actually called reverse files in this 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.190
 you can actually see dipper and mabel 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.230
 with another role in the series instead of being 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.540
 the spains twins are the twins 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.610
 joys while peaceful and lion 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 are two boys who spend the summer in the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.050
 mystery shop personalities 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.150
 of the twins are bad 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.280
 mabel a cocky girl and cruel gripper 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380
 a serious and aggressive boy practice 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090
 dark magic and has more contact with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.780
 key bill and also in its version 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.369
 humanoid but that is another reality 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.860
 peaceful and deon are the opposite to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.950
 their original versions here they are 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.170
 insecure and good guys even if they do 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.330
 more characters in this reality these 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 four are the ones that stand out the most 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.500
 reality is in last place since 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
 although it has good context, it is already very 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 used that that in another reality the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.320
 good is bad and bad is good but 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.250
 I still liked that dark touch and 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.110
 mysterious place number 4 in this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.060
 post is the reality of morín 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.070
 marc moore ingmar who is an artist who 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 create different comics where they show 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.960
 alternative final parodies or 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.420
 explanations of the episodes premiered 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.130
 in this reality you can see different 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 past views of different 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.160
 funny scenes characters ever 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.990
 views up to parodies towards alexis is 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.210
 in this position because even if it is not 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.280
 reality so alternate is very fun and 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.460
 they show us a different ending to the one 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.410
 they showed us in the episodes the links 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.040
 of morín mark the description and in the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.050
 video post number 3 reaching the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.330
 half of the video in this position is the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.390
 reality the summer of the twins stands 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.970
 in gravity with this reality is simple 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.250
 to understand the twins are children 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.430
 mabel is her great aunt and her uncle 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 grandfather and also the author of the diaries 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.600
 this reality is very interesting because 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.610
 show us the twins stands as 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.620
 the protagonists show us their 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 experiences in gravity falls its 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.460
 interaction with characters that in the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.470
 original story were older and now 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.270
 children and what the personalities would look like 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.790
 of the characters now that they are from 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.280
 different was mabel like aunt grandmother 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.410
 would be scammer how are they and see how 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.170
 the author would be just as distrustful as 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.860
 fort that really makes you think 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.830
 place number 2 in position 2 is threesome 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.480
 mystery in this reality focus on 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.670
 the life of the stands when they were 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.590
 young and without wrinkles in this reality 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 they never fought and they remained united 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.520
 as brothers although you see things 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.170
 different as phil de fort knows 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.209
 they 're both in school, you have to 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.550
 be it stayed with are and interact 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.890
 with them this reality seems more like a 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.110
 series of the 70 although this reality 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.569
 has a second side called the trio 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.849
 mystery are hard to fort 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.950
 they go to gravity falls they take care of 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.260
 investigate the paranormal mysteries of 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.630
 gravity falls and archive them in a series 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.060
 of newspapers they live in the cabin of the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.769
 mystery and all very close but one day 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.239
 They decided to create a machine to 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.519
 discover the secrets of the universe 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.620
 something horrible happened and the man 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.930
 called stanford james was absorbed by 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.760
 the portal are and phil de fort took 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.820
 different paths and never again 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.979
 they returned to see until now this 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.870
 reality starts very well all very 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.020
 united but then it gets tense and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.850
 shocking what the mystery trio was a 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.680
 theory that was created to explain what 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.419
 it happened 30 years ago 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.340
 is so if phil de ford based on what 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.710
 seen in different episodes like the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.500
 blind eye society the traveling pig 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.710
 of time and the crazy guys put 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.660
 number one arriving at the end of this the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.720
 reality created by a gravity fan 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.900
 force is the living and active reality and it is 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.610
 another artist who created this reality 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.070
 this reality is situated in an era 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.229
 old full of mistrust and danger 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.270
 here it is seen that dee lives with the essence 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.190
 of the evil vile key allowing the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.900
 existence of viper which is a 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.880
 public enemy for all of 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.759
 gravity falls but being inside the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.259
 hyper is impossible to eliminate it in this 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.419
 world the essence of the series does not 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.580
 disappears but gives more seriousness and a 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.530
 dark touch since you see that children like 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.960
 babel or dipper must live situations 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.910
 very psychological and dangerous also 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.919
 they see blood guns and a great 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.229
 degree of distrust and conflicts 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.289
 while the series is progressing this 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.240
 world will bring new things besides they look 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.370
 things like physical fights between 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.550
 allies search for power and losses 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.889
 irremediable good friends I hope that 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.220
 you liked this original video what 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.520
 I did 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.810
 with a lot of creativity and effort hehe 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.150
 some things that I said I invented them 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.480
 but I think they understood the message of 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.160
 video the fandom is complicated the links 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.410
 of several artists who create these 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.440
 multiple realities of gravity folk are 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.180
 will find in the description if they know 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.570
 other realities that I did not mention and 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.160
 they consider great they can comment 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.440
 good with nothing more to say my 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.320
 observers if they have not done so yet 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.240
