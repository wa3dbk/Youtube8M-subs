00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.330
 fundecyt party 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.210
 In the law 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.870
 but those measures do not 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.640
 is your letter 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.820
 I was surprised what he fucked 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.190

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.099
 logical doors is first 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.009
 you have to do so 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.409
 but there it captures two cards 1 2 make two cards pass 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.180
 and then they say that close with 600 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.009
 two letters add more 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.979
 you just left behind in 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.309

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.519
 the 3d and he added the famous one we have 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.939
 the astronomers used the guerrilla 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.209
 and we will send it to just below the two letters that we have chosen 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.809
 no longer legible port terrain 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.919

 iker the letter in third place together 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.049
 so what do we do now 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 we do the same but with only one letter 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.439
 no matter what 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.079
 well but you have to go against him 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.710
 and if we are a little long 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.710

 release to the letter the letter is 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.959
