00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.970 
the reason you want to cut the stem part
small<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.560> thick

small is because you know this is thick

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.220 
small is because you know this is thick
and<00:02:14.130> takes<00:02:15.030> longer<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.390> cook<00:02:15.420> down<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> leafy

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
