longer<00:04:18.159> gun<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.909> I<00:04:19.090> thought<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.959> would<00:04:20.049> be<00:04:20.789> like

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
longer gun I I thought it would be like

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:22.960 
longer gun I I thought it would be like
a<00:04:21.820> lot<00:04:22.090> better<00:04:22.330> than<00:04:22.599> a<00:04:22.630> four

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
a lot better than a four

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
one but my friend has a shorter one and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.650 
one but my friend has a shorter one and
it<00:04:25.130> shoots<00:04:25.400> almost<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:25.970> as<00:04:26.090> accurate<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
it shoots almost just as accurate and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.650 
it shoots almost just as accurate and
almost<00:04:26.930> just<00:04:26.960> as<00:04:27.230> far<00:04:27.700> but<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.970> wanted<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.450> try<00:04:29.630> a
