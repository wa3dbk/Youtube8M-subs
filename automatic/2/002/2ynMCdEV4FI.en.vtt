for businesses among them was

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.530 
for businesses among them was

high<00:01:07.110> tech<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.770> day<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:07.950> age<00:01:08.130> we've<00:01:08.369> been

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
high tech in this day and age we've been

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
high tech in this day and age we've been
doing<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> long<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.320> they

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
doing it for a long time you know they

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.969 
doing it for a long time you know they
wanted<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> emphasize<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.670> guess<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.979> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
wanted to emphasize I guess that that we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
wanted to emphasize I guess that that we
need<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> cut<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.880> our<00:01:15.150> communities<00:01:15.780> they

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
need to cut down on our communities they

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.580 
need to cut down on our communities they
also<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:16.830> ever<00:01:17.009> LEDs<00:01:18.320> which<00:01:19.320> save

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
also had these ever LEDs which save

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
also had these ever LEDs which save
power<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:20.130> well<00:01:22.009> moving<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.490> public

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
not so common here in Japan their

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.610 
not so common here in Japan their
walk-in<00:01:43.620> refrigerators<00:01:45.050> but<00:01:46.050> they<00:01:46.170> also<00:01:46.320> had

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
walk-in refrigerators but they also had

a<00:01:46.650> lot<00:01:46.830> of<00:01:46.860> other<00:01:47.100> energy-saving

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
a lot of other energy-saving

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.370 
a lot of other energy-saving
technologies<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:53.360> now<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.990> big

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
technologies there now this this big

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.300 
technologies there now this this big
disk<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.110> might<00:01:58.260> guess<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.830> solar

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
disk here as you might guess is a solar

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.510 
disk here as you might guess is a solar
charging<00:01:59.850> station<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.810> cars<00:02:01.050> now<00:02:01.410> they<00:02:02.310> also

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
charging station for cars now they also

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
charging station for cars now they also
had<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.660> display<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.710> PD

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
had this actually on display at the PD

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
had this actually on display at the PD
echo<00:02:05.490> products<00:02:05.850> exhibition<00:02:06.619> which<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.770> quite

thing about this exhibition it was

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.949 
thing about this exhibition it was
absolutely<00:02:13.110> huge<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.690> Panasonic<00:02:15.690> seemed

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
absolutely huge and Panasonic seemed

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.699 
absolutely huge and Panasonic seemed
like<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.320> were<00:02:16.380> sparing<00:02:16.709> no<00:02:16.950> expense<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:19.020> mean

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709

all<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.550> technology<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.330> great<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.810> when

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
all of this technology is great and when

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.250 
all of this technology is great and when
you<00:02:21.989> tie<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.200> together<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.739> makes<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> very

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you tie it together it makes for a very

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.830 
you tie it together it makes for a very
that<00:02:25.260> makes<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:25.890> nice<00:02:26.160> vision<00:02:26.840> does

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that makes for a really nice vision does

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.380 
that makes for a really nice vision does
look<00:02:28.140> expensive<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.820> with<00:02:30.120> any<00:02:30.300> luck

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
look expensive but with any luck
