if<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.859> could<00:01:02.010> come<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> train<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.030> then

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
if we could come on the train and then

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
if we could come on the train and then
get<00:01:03.510> straight<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> steam<00:01:04.110> train<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.710> use

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
