00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
sure what to call it but by far his

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.070 
sure what to call it but by far his
biggest<00:04:01.260> attacker<00:04:01.620> for<00:04:02.070> right<00:04:02.370> now<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.760> um<00:04:03.080> is

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
biggest attacker for right now is um is

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.040 
biggest attacker for right now is um is
kiram<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.730> he<00:04:05.820> plays<00:04:06.000> pokemon<00:04:06.450> catcher<00:04:06.690> and
