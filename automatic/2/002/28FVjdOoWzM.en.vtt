00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 Hello everyone, Andrey Andreyev 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.919
 Andreevich my site all-all point ru 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.920
 1524 tasks will be solved only under 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 letter b they are both the same problem that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.609
 still a letter and a letter would absolutely 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.199
 I decide the same thing only under the letter b 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.310
 find the arithmetic mean of the numbers and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.150
 round the answer to the thousandth and so to us 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.449
 The following numbers are given: 3 whole two hundred 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.270
 thirty four thousandths 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.870
 at first we count the sum of all numbers 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 so plus the second number is 3 integers 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.760
 four hundred fifty two thousandths plus 4 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 point one hundred and eighty five thousand plus 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 2 point eight hundred and ninety two thousandths 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 when we want to find the mean 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.649
 arithmetic we consider the sum of all 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 of our numbers and then the resulting amount 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:06.030
 divide by the number of these same numbers by 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 the number of terms is two three four 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 we have 4 numbers 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.869
 if we are looking for the arithmetic mean then 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.049
 we will divide by 4 why by 4 because 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.100
 there are 4 of them here 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.420
 it turned out all the same when we count 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 the answer will be the arithmetic mean then 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.610
 there is what we need to find so well what 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 let's count let's try immediately 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:44.390
 count the total amount 3, 23 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:53.780
 this is a tall raspberry 3, 2 3 4 3, 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:56.130
 4524, 185 barely 892 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.460
 so long not to suffer, let's immediately 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.009
 count the sum of all four components 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 one big amount 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:12.170
 think so 4 to 5 9 2 to 2 another 49 to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.069
 413 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:28.130
 rewrite one moment 9 to 110 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:30.530
 yes even eight in 1818 yes 3 this is 21 this is 526 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.970
 6 we write two in mind 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.470
 I do not need to cross numbers 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.569
 crossed out because there are too many 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.730
 to see which ones I already counted 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.590
 not yet, but in general it is certainly not to strike 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.709
 just need it more convenient gives out too 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.709
 many 8 to 210 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:59.850
 15 17 7 write 1 in mind 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:04.049
 This is 6 and even 4 10 and 13 is obtained here 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.310
 such a number so look here we are 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:13.100
 counted the amount in parentheses it turned out 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.920
 13.7 thousandths it should be divided by 4 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.640
 let's try to divide by four 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:26.239
 the resulting sum is divided by 4 take on 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:30.090
 33 on 412 subtract we get 1 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.459
 we take down the seven the seven stands already after 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.140
 comma 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:45.410
 put a comma and take 4 4 â€‹â€‹by 4 16 16 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.410
 we take down again we take on 4 4 on 4 16 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.380
 we take down the top three 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.209
 see the top three we took down well 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:58.370
 the resulting number is less than 4 write 0 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:05.730
 append here another 0 take on 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:08.670
 of 77 to 428 get a deuce appends 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.989
 0 and the last time we take 5 not 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.389
 breaks the patent there we get 20 then 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.430
 there are seven and then 5 goes further but here 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.430
 5 just did not fit 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.599
 it turns out three, four 4075 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.840
 and we were asked to round up the project 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.930
 thousandths 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:41.069
 whole 10 hundredths that is 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:46.110
 round that up to the thousandths 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:47.969
 the rest is all discarded , there is one 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.029
 the parts that are discarded are the leftmost 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.159
 figure this seven seven large figure 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.840
 Therefore, the following is passed to one. 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.409
 discharge here economics add 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.479
 one will be one 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:03.539
 we round when we round we put glue 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:08.490
 equals wavy three, four 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:11.779
 four 1.0 hatch added one here 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.779
 such an answer turns out that's all for it 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.779
 until
