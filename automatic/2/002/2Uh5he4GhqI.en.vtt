and whatever photo editing software that
you're<00:02:08.910> using<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:10.770> suggest<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.400> a

you're using the I suggest you get a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.650 
you're using the I suggest you get a
different<00:02:11.640> one

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
different one

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.640 
different one
because<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.540> sonic<00:02:15.540> software<00:02:16.140> worth<00:02:16.410> its

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
because I the sonic software worth its

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920 
because I the sonic software worth its
salt<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.460> going<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.270> these<00:02:18.390> tools

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
salt is going to have one of these tools

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
salt is going to have one of these tools
which<00:02:19.610> makes<00:02:20.610> everything<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.090> little<00:02:21.240> bit

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
which makes everything a little bit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
which makes everything a little bit
easier<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.810> us<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.410> right<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.650> that's<00:02:22.800> all

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
easier for us all right so that's all

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.540 
easier for us all right so that's all
pointed<00:02:23.610> out<00:02:23.820> here<00:02:24.200> all<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.530> now<00:02:25.650> we're

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
pointed out here all right and now we're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.430 
pointed out here all right and now we're
going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> do<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> same<00:02:27.630> thing<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.380> other

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
going to do the same thing for the other

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.420 
going to do the same thing for the other
side<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.670> clicks<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.920> I'll<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.190> this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
side so just clicks now I'll do this

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
side so just clicks now I'll do this
pretty<00:02:32.700> quickly<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.600> i<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.990> look<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
pretty quickly so if i do to look a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
pretty quickly so if i do to look a
little<00:02:34.380> bit<00:02:34.530> more<00:02:34.740> choppy<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.490> yours

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
little bit more choppy that yours

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.430 
little bit more choppy that yours
probably<00:02:36.210> will<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.500> that's<00:02:37.710> okay<00:02:39.440> now

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
probably will but that's okay now

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
probably will but that's okay now
believe<00:02:40.830> these<00:02:41.010> are<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.400> same<00:02:41.610> anyway<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.330> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
believe these are the same anyway so it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.600 
believe these are the same anyway so it
really<00:02:42.540> doesn't<00:02:42.750> matter<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.950> once<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.460> get

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
really doesn't matter so once you get

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.000 
really doesn't matter so once you get
this<00:02:44.820> done<00:02:47.870> there<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.230> also<00:02:49.860> other

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this done there there there also other

this done there there there also other
voices<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.700> also<00:02:50.820> use<00:02:51.390> alphas<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:53.220> just

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
voices you can also use alphas to just

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
voices you can also use alphas to just
give<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.320> complete<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.620> total<00:02:55.770> white<00:02:56.160> of

save this as that we're going to use a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.800 
save this as that we're going to use a
passive<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.030> JPEG<00:03:18.720> oh<00:03:19.140> my<00:03:19.890> case<00:03:20.100> jpg<00:03:20.730> I'll<00:03:21.570> put

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
passive a JPEG oh my case jpg I'll put

passive a JPEG oh my case jpg I'll put
that<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.050> hundred<00:03:22.260> percent<00:03:22.290> quality<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.100> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that one hundred percent quality so you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.420 
that one hundred percent quality so you
don't<00:03:23.430> lose<00:03:23.580> any<00:03:23.760> quality<00:03:24.300> when<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.920> add<00:03:25.920> it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
don't lose any quality when you add it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.910 
don't lose any quality when you add it
so<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.720> should<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> have<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> better<00:03:28.740> one

in it I'll be leaves really quickly yes
this<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.240> nice<00:04:51.390> assumed<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.990> on<00:04:52.340> your<00:04:53.340> good

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
this is nice assumed it on your good

this is nice assumed it on your good
notice<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.120> got<00:04:54.270> this<00:04:54.450> area<00:04:54.870> right<00:04:55.050> here

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
notice that you got this area right here

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
now this is actually area that should be

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.570 
now this is actually area that should be
blacked<00:04:58.440> out<00:04:58.650> because<00:04:59.040> everything<00:04:59.400> that's

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
blacked out because everything that's

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.650 
blacked out because everything that's
blacked<00:04:59.880> out<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:01.190> see-through<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:03.030> these<00:05:03.600> are

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
blacked out is see-through so these are

blacked out is see-through so these are
the<00:05:03.900> areas<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.200> should<00:05:04.350> be<00:05:04.650> blacked<00:05:04.890> out<00:05:05.070> now

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
the areas that should be blacked out now

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.580 
the areas that should be blacked out now
the<00:05:05.460> easiest<00:05:05.880> way<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.270> do<00:05:06.420> this<00:05:06.450> is<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.560> use

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
the easiest way to do this is to use

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.190 
the easiest way to do this is to use
your<00:05:08.070> when<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.340> select<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.450> leaf<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:10.050> your

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
your when you select the leaf of your

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.780 
your when you select the leaf of your
lasso<00:05:11.180> you're<00:05:12.180> going<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:12.740> not<00:05:13.740> finish<00:05:14.430> it

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
lasso you're going to not finish it

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.430 
lasso you're going to not finish it
right<00:05:15.060> away<00:05:15.210> you're<00:05:15.510> going<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.870> select<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
right away you're going to select the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.890 
right away you're going to select the
areas<00:05:16.890> around<00:05:17.040> it<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.670> then<00:05:18.330> you're<00:05:18.480> going<00:05:18.840> to

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
areas around it and then you're going to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.900 
areas around it and then you're going to
fill<00:05:19.110> those<00:05:19.260> it<00:05:19.500> with<00:05:19.590> black<00:05:19.890> because<00:05:20.340> it's

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
fill those it with black because it's

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.740 
fill those it with black because it's
really<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> easiest<00:05:21.420> way<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.870> do<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:23.750> but

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
really the easiest way to do it but

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.090 
really the easiest way to do it but
there<00:05:24.900> are<00:05:24.930> also<00:05:25.080> other<00:05:25.440> ways<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:25.890> you<00:05:25.920> can
