really<00:01:55.390> easy<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.810> set<00:01:55.960> up<00:01:55.990> I'm<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.740> place

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
really easy to set up I'm going to place

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.999 
really easy to set up I'm going to place
one<00:01:57.070> on<00:01:57.100> this<00:01:57.340> far<00:01:57.549> block<00:01:57.789> name<00:01:58.210> one<00:01:58.479> going<00:01:58.780> up

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
one on this far block name one going up

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.139 
one on this far block name one going up
then<00:02:00.009> come<00:02:00.219> down<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.729> want<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:00.939> go<00:02:01.000> all<00:02:01.119> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
then come down you want to go all the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.490 
then come down you want to go all the
way<00:02:01.240> across<00:02:01.539> and<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.420> stop<00:02:04.659> right<00:02:05.049> here

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
way across and make it stop right here

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.740 
way across and make it stop right here
I'm<00:02:06.399> going<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.549> place<00:02:06.789> your<00:02:07.119> first<00:02:07.299> lever<00:02:07.569> down

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
I'm going to place your first lever down

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.020 
I'm going to place your first lever down
make<00:02:08.739> sure<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> circuit<00:02:09.369> works<00:02:09.580> all<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.000> way

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
make sure the circuit works all the way

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.600 
make sure the circuit works all the way
through<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:13.269> can<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.690> does<00:02:17.280> yep<00:02:18.280> works

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
through as you can see it does yep works

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.729 
through as you can see it does yep works
all<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> way<00:02:18.849> through<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:20.019> we<00:02:20.079> want<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.410> do<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
all the way through now we want to do is

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.630 
all the way through now we want to do is
come<00:02:21.040> back<00:02:21.130> over<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.370> turn<00:02:21.760> off<00:02:21.880> your<00:02:22.000> lever

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
come back over here turn off your lever

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.330 
come back over here turn off your lever
then<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.790> want<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> play<00:02:25.090> some<00:02:25.239> redstone

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
then you want to play some redstone

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.059 
then you want to play some redstone
again<00:02:27.340> leave<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.239> block<00:02:28.450> empty<00:02:28.780> right<00:02:28.930> here

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
again leave this block empty right here

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.110 
again leave this block empty right here
you<00:02:30.069> want<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> leave<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.549> empty<00:02:30.880> if<00:02:31.000> you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
you want to leave that empty if you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.670 
you want to leave that empty if you
don't<00:02:31.269> leave<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.420> empty<00:02:31.810> with<00:02:31.930> redstone<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
don't leave that empty with redstone it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400 
don't leave that empty with redstone it
will<00:02:32.920> not<00:02:33.069> work<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.549> right<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:34.840> you're<00:02:35.230> going

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
will not work so right here you're going

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.000 
will not work so right here you're going
to<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.620> put<00:02:35.739> in<00:02:35.829> another<00:02:35.980> lever<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.180> then

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to want to put in another lever and then

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.920 
to want to put in another lever and then
some<00:02:39.010> more<00:02:39.160> redstone<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:40.299> keep<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.599> going

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
some more redstone to keep it going

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.589 
some more redstone to keep it going
until<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.769> even<00:02:42.099> when<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.269> Redstone

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
until it's even when with the Redstone

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.530 
until it's even when with the Redstone
across<00:02:43.870> from<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.640> all<00:02:45.640> right<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.030> now<00:02:46.120> here's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
across from it all right so now here's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.089 
across from it all right so now here's
where<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.810> slabs<00:02:47.110> come<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.920> want<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
where your slabs come in you want to

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.990 
where your slabs come in you want to
place<00:02:48.250> your<00:02:48.280> slabs<00:02:49.560> over<00:02:50.560> your<00:02:50.769> redstone<00:02:51.000> this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
place your slabs over your redstone this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.090 
place your slabs over your redstone this
will<00:02:52.180> keep<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.450> TNT<00:02:52.870> falling<00:02:53.769> straight<00:02:54.040> down

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
will keep the TNT falling straight down

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.479 
will keep the TNT falling straight down
and<00:02:54.639> not<00:02:55.410> falling<00:02:56.410> onto<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.829> wood<00:02:57.100> or

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
and not falling onto the wood or

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.090 
and not falling onto the wood or
whatever<00:02:57.819> block<00:02:58.000> you're<00:02:58.150> using<00:02:58.739> all<00:02:59.739> right<00:02:59.920> so

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
whatever block you're using all right so

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.340 
whatever block you're using all right so
now<00:03:00.220> let's<00:03:00.459> make<00:03:00.700> sure<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.030> works<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.840> does

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
now let's make sure this works it does

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.920 
now let's make sure this works it does
all<00:03:03.310> right<00:03:03.459> now<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:04.120> time<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.269> set<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
all right now it's time to set down the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.420 
all right now it's time to set down the
TNT<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:06.579> you're<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.880> have<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.150> laser<00:03:07.329> TNT

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
TNT so you're going to have to laser TNT

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.259 
TNT so you're going to have to laser TNT
all<00:03:09.430> right<00:03:09.549> you're<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.180> on

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
all right you're going to have one on

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.590 
all right you're going to have one on
the<00:03:10.329> bottom<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.079> then<00:03:12.030> you're<00:03:13.030> gonna<00:03:13.150> have

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
the bottom and then you're gonna have

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770 
the bottom and then you're gonna have
another<00:03:13.989> lever<00:03:14.290> or<00:03:14.859> never<00:03:15.190> another<00:03:16.150> level<00:03:16.510> on

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
another lever or never another level on

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.930 
another lever or never another level on
the<00:03:16.900> top<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:18.040> want<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.220> place<00:03:18.370> one<00:03:18.400> T<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.849> T

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the top you want to place one T and T

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.680 
the top you want to place one T and T
above<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.599> slab<00:03:20.609> okay<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:22.060> now<00:03:22.180> let's<00:03:22.450> go<00:03:22.569> see

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
above the slab okay so now let's go see

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.150 
above the slab okay so now let's go see
if<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.870> works<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:24.849> it<00:03:24.970> works<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.329> right<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
if it works so if it works just right it

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.250 
if it works so if it works just right it
will<00:03:27.280> shoot<00:03:27.819> extremely<00:03:28.239> far<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.989> might<00:03:29.139> want

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
will shoot extremely far you might want

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.170 
will shoot extremely far you might want
to<00:03:29.290> cover<00:03:29.440> your<00:03:29.620> ears<00:03:29.919> or<00:03:30.519> turn<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:30.910> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
to cover your ears or turn down the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.300 
to cover your ears or turn down the
volume<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.169> let's<00:03:32.319> see<00:03:32.410> if<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.829> works<00:03:33.069> so

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
volume so let's see if this works so

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.409 
volume so let's see if this works so
first<00:03:33.639> like<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.880> want<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.060> hit<00:03:34.150> your<00:03:34.209> top

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
first like we want to hit your top

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.960 
first like we want to hit your top
switch<00:03:34.690> first<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:36.010> TNT<00:03:36.430> drop<00:03:36.669> you

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
switch first so you see the TNT drop you

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.759 
switch first so you see the TNT drop you
want<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.150> wait<00:03:37.269> around<00:03:37.359> three<00:03:37.630> seconds<00:03:38.019> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
want to wait around three seconds and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.110 
want to wait around three seconds and
there<00:03:39.579> we<00:03:39.760> go

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
there we go

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.420 
there we go
it<00:03:40.359> shoots<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:40.780> far<00:03:41.109> really<00:03:41.769> easy<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.220> make

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it shoots really far really easy to make

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.099 
it shoots really far really easy to make
so<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.450> hope<00:03:43.569> you<00:03:43.630> guys<00:03:43.720> liked<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.989> video
