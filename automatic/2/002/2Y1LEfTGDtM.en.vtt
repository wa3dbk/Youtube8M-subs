00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.420

 we can do to transform the house 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.170
 without it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.520
 to a nightmare for the pocket because 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.259
 notice that it is proven that one of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.570
 the ways in which people spend 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.180
 his bonus that is coming is almost 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.009
 just remodeling your house so

 we are ready to listen to tips from 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.420
 how how to apply how to adapt this 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.830
 style pints in the house clear that 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.080
 existed when I believe that the first 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.119
 you have to explain they covered that I'm 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.330
 say is the vintage style good in itself 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.520
 the the word vintage or or the term the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.909
 trend to vintage style is more than 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.009
 nothing the combination of styles of times 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.240
 passed for example what comes from a 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.789
 abbot right now 50 60 70 that were times 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.039
 that they marked already have very 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.399
 marked then is to take several 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.429
 elements of these times and make a 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.799
 combination with modernist elements not 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.740
 a minimalist point and this is what 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.570
 makes us that very godly combination 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.179
 that shows us a little bit of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.640
 that retro touch that drives us crazy 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.110
 to all the truth that is incredible has 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.820
 touched having many good house places 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.190
 also but many new hotels 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.090
 they have the very modernist part but that 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.810
 vintage style 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.740
 is well selected in an armchair in 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.660
 a in a radius in a corner in a no 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.270
 There are many little details that we can 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.610
 have at home there corner two or in 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.200
 the street in the quarter of the triques or 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.340
 of tiliches as many people 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.750
 comments and that now can be 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.190
 rescued and can be elements of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650
 What are these elements? 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.330
 that we can use to be able to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.220
 talk like vintage style in our 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.590
 clear house good first of all there's 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.959
 to choose well the space that we want 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.150
 decorating can be the whole house so clear 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.060
 but then let's start, because it depends 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.220
 much of the personality of the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.650
 guy who wants to reshape the size 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.390
 the space the lighting all this for 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 see what elements we can combine good 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.220
 to begin what are key elements 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.040
 for this vintage style 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.790
 what would be armchairs chairs tables 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.460
 chandeliers pictures lamps all 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.300
 this and basically we can go to a bazaar 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.400
 cited and rescue these elements that 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.560
 we can give a restoration to very low 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.750
 cost even at home does not come home 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.130
 from dad mom or grandma and say hey 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.500
 ticos 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.020
 and this is what is father because we 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.480
 mix romanticism mixes us the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.150
 elegance also a little 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.660
 nostalgia for having several times in one 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.490
 same in the same room totally 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.380
 we are seeing here the images of how 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.510
 could be this style not from 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.480
 apply it in the room through a 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.550
 fireplace or a table to the mirrors 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.700
 that were very classic seventies not this 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.860
 kind of of half frames like cary 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.660
 goals and golds that I signed the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.700
 big ones look golden 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.800
 exact Victorian were used in how 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.290
 in the 70s now tell me something if you 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.750
 you start adapting some part of your 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.910
 you can do it in the whole house 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.060
 or you could see very loaded the same and 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.100
 nothing else is it is for certain areas or as 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.390
 I would recommend this good 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.250
 recommendation is the following you can 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.900
 do where you want if you want in 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.430
 do your home but always do it 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.760
 Measurement must always be taken into account 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.470
 he does not saturate a room saturated by 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.660
 most beautiful items you have 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.150
 They eat each other and it stops being nice 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.030
 now also the perfect combination of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.000
 see elements 10 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.790
 the ancients with the modern because yes 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.130
 put too many old things 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.340
 it gets old then that's the touch 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.770
 that one should know with say here by 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.990
 example the bedroom I would love me 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 I imagine her a tubular bed like that of sacyr 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.640
 skills that have their walls and 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.170
 apart some old lamps a mirror 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.960
 Victorian there is a tupper and action the 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.500
 friend down not everything in bone colors well 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.900
 In fact, that would be like for me 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.510
 Ideal for modern lamps 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.490
 so as not to lose that touch and I know it 's a 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.200
 perfect combination not exercising in 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.840
 the celebrations acts and now the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.540
 tapestries also play a role 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.060
 important the tapestries can be a 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.330
 key piece even to have as 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.889
 vintage element nothing more than the tapestry and you 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.979
 table 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.280
 modern minimalist few things and the 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.990
 touch that gives is is very elementary wow 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.610
 people who had the opportunity to 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.169
 visit some of these stores the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.909
 truth is that the vast majority of them 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.279
 who sell these types of items already 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.169
 restored are not so cheap what 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.819
 It would be advisable to restore or 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.840
 look for the bazaars that you well 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.539
 you comment that they are an excellent 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.849
 alternative on weekend or rescue 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.930
 what's in grandma's house or same 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.789
 as I told them in the room 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.599
 surely from there the triques must 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.750
 to have something something that can be adapted 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.550
 to be clean look perfectly well 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.219
 restore it back to life and 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.870
 place it as a nice decoration there 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.819
 many pages on the internet that we 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.759
 can guide on how to do 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.099
 things that look new even if they have 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.639
 already a lot of time not for example 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.389
 grab a chair of these cut 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.900
 well I do not know 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:17.300
 louis 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.729
 age and asks for surely the 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.259
 varnish already to be damaged but you can 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.169
 take to reupholster and you put some 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.389
 colors so modern and looks great 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.360
 because you are mixing the old with the 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.580
 new I share the father that you do 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.990
 alone do not go to stations 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.389
 wonderful that exist where 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.570
 you find from the painting of the closet 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.610
 the mat you find everything not then 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.590
 that you already having very clear what is the 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.310
 concept and what areas of your home are the 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.680
 what do you want 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.060
 remodel you pay with your family as 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.500
 better if right now well also go 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.810
 to come the December holidays and 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.669
 you have the purchasing power already counted 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.740
 aguinaldo to be able to make these changes 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.930
 then doing it also with the family is 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.520
 father clear and above all look for and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.650
 find the best alternative I think 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.690
 that informing us is very important and 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.000
 will help us save a lot in 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.770
 this but ice cold tasks 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.340
 thank you for accompanying the thanks for 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.340
 those tips
