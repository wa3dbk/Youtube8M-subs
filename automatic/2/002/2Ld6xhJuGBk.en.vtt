00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.649 

so<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.100> received<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.790> request<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.270> explain

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so I received a request to explain

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.140 
so I received a request to explain
automatic<00:00:04.230> versus<00:00:04.650> manual<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.460> held<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
automatic versus manual and held the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.460 
automatic versus manual and held the
cars<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.600> these<00:00:06.720> different<00:00:07.140> types<00:00:07.319> of

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
cars with these different types of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.549 
cars with these different types of
transmissions<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.340> different<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.380> going

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
transmissions are different so I'm going

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.290 
transmissions are different so I'm going
to<00:00:10.590> start<00:00:10.769> off<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.280> layout<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.940> an

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
to start off with the layout in an

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640 
to start off with the layout in an
automatic<00:00:12.809> car<00:00:13.019> you're<00:00:13.230> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
automatic car you're going to have the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.410 
automatic car you're going to have the
engine<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.549> will<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.790> connected<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
engine which will be connected to a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.720 
engine which will be connected to a
torque<00:00:15.870> converter<00:00:16.010> which<00:00:17.010> will<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.279> connected

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
torque converter which will be connected

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
torque converter which will be connected
to<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> transmission<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.800> that's<00:00:20.010> how<00:00:20.160> it's

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to a transmission so that's how it's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
to a transmission so that's how it's
going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> pass<00:00:20.670> through<00:00:21.060> now<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:22.020> attached

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
going to pass through now I've attached

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.019 
going to pass through now I've attached
a<00:00:22.650> video<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> torque<00:00:23.460> converter<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a video of a torque converter if you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
a video of a torque converter if you
don't<00:00:24.210> know<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.630> works<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.080> pretty

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
don't know how that works that's pretty

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.929 
don't know how that works that's pretty
important<00:00:26.010> part<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.490> automatic

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
important part of an automatic

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.370 
important part of an automatic
transmission<00:00:28.189> whereas<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:30.170> manual<00:00:31.170> you're

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
transmission whereas in a manual you're

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.450 
transmission whereas in a manual you're
going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.740> engine<00:00:32.070> which<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
going to have an engine which is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
going to have an engine which is
connected<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.030> clutch<00:00:33.390> which<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.469> press

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
connected to a clutch which will press

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.369 
connected to a clutch which will press
against<00:00:36.739> both<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.770> engine<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.340> transmission

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
against both the engine and transmission

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.369 
against both the engine and transmission
lie<00:00:40.379> between<00:00:40.680> them<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
lie between them and so that the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
lie between them and so that the
transmission<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.040> spinning<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
transmission will be spinning up at the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.229 
transmission will be spinning up at the
speed<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> wheels<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.520> spinning<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.000> your

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
speed the wheels are spinning and your

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.430 
speed the wheels are spinning and your
engine<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.690> spinning<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.260> whatever

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
engine will be spinning at whatever

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
engine will be spinning at whatever
speed<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.850> clutch<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.329> help

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
speed that is and this clutch will help

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.930 
speed that is and this clutch will help
match<00:00:51.989> these<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.739> together<00:00:52.949> whereas<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
match these two together whereas a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.189 
match these two together whereas a
torque<00:00:54.329> converter<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> at

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
torque converter they can be at

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
torque converter they can be at
different<00:00:55.559> speeds<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> engine<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
different speeds to engine and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
different speeds to engine and
transmission<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.289> automatic<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
transmission so a automatic is going to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
transmission so a automatic is going to
have<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.010> set<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.340> years<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.820> possibly<00:01:03.180> well

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have one set of years or possibly well

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
have one set of years or possibly well
most<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.320> two<00:01:04.500> sets<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.070> planetary

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
most will have two sets of planetary

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140 
most will have two sets of planetary
gears<00:01:06.350> whereas<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.710> manual<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.700> multiple

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
gears whereas a manual have multiple

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
gears whereas a manual have multiple
sets<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> gears<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> choose<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:10.799> you'll<00:01:11.070> have

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
sets of gears to choose from you'll have

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.410 
sets of gears to choose from you'll have
a<00:01:11.659> gear<00:01:12.659> shift<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.680> clutch<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.490> third<00:01:15.150> pedal

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
a gear shift and a clutch a third pedal

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.410 
a gear shift and a clutch a third pedal
and<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.130> choose<00:01:17.490> between<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.970> different

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and you can choose between the different

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.530 
and you can choose between the different
gears<00:01:18.799> whereas<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:20.070> automatic<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.090> car

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
gears whereas an automatic the car

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.179 
gears whereas an automatic the car
itself<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.530> computers<00:01:23.009> will

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
itself will do it for you computers will

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640 
itself will do it for you computers will
do<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> based<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:24.600> engine<00:01:24.990> speed<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.350> how

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
do it based on your engine speed and how

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.950 
do it based on your engine speed and how
fast<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
fast you're going so there will not be a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
fast you're going so there will not be a
clutch<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> gear

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
clutch and there will not be a gear

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.950 
clutch and there will not be a gear
shift<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> speak<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.600> two

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
shift so to speak that you get one two

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
shift so to speak that you get one two
three<00:01:34.500> four<00:01:34.860> five<00:01:35.280> reverse<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.850> what<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> looks

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
three four five reverse so what it looks

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.149 
three four five reverse so what it looks
like<00:01:39.299> inside<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.990> an<00:01:40.079> automatic<00:01:40.409> gear<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like inside of an automatic gear is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
like inside of an automatic gear is
you're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.210> planetary

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you're going to have these planetary

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.190 
you're going to have these planetary
gears<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.759> just<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.450> terminology

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
gears so just a little for terminology

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
gears so just a little for terminology

to the Sun gear and then around all of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.899 
to the Sun gear and then around all of
it<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.250> ring<00:01:56.460> gear<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
it you're going to have a ring gear and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.840 
it you're going to have a ring gear and
there's<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> carrier<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.979> holds

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there's going to be a carrier that holds

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's going to be a carrier that holds
the<00:02:00.299> planets<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.930> certain<00:02:01.229> distance<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.829> each

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the planets a certain distance from each

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.620 
the planets a certain distance from each
other

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
other

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.180 
other
now<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> planetary<00:02:04.259> gear<00:02:04.560> box<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.610> can

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
now with the planetary gear box you can

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.850 
now with the planetary gear box you can
change<00:02:08.390> through<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> system<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> clutches<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
change through a system of clutches and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
change through a system of clutches and
belts<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.030> can

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
belts you can

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.290 
belts you can
which<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:12.990> is<00:02:13.020> driven<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
which one is driven and which one is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.380 
which one is driven and which one is
driving<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.800> example<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.460> have<00:02:17.490> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
driving so for example you can have the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
driving so for example you can have the
engine<00:02:19.110> driving<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.860> Sun<00:02:20.100> gear<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.580> then

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
engine driving the Sun gear and then

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.600 
engine driving the Sun gear and then
output<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> wheels<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.130> r<00:02:23.160> ND<00:02:23.580> r

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
output going to the wheels on the r ND r

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.230 
output going to the wheels on the r ND r
or<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.420> reverse<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:26.240> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
or you can reverse it you can have the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.310 
or you can reverse it you can have the
engine<00:02:27.750> driving<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.290> rim<00:02:28.470> gear<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.840> then<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
engine driving the rim gear and then the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.950 
engine driving the rim gear and then the
output<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:32.130> from<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> Sun<00:02:32.760> gear<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.240> by

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
output going from the Sun gear and by

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.900 
output going from the Sun gear and by
manipulating<00:02:34.830> which<00:02:35.010> one's<00:02:35.250> driven<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
manipulating which one's driven and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.600 
manipulating which one's driven and
which<00:02:36.060> one's<00:02:36.300> driving<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.890> change<00:02:38.250> gear

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
which one's driving you can change gear

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.160 
which one's driving you can change gear
ratios<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.780> two<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:39.990> these

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
ratios so if you have two of these

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.320 
ratios so if you have two of these
back-to-back<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.610> four<00:02:41.880> sets<00:02:42.209> of

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
back-to-back you can have four sets of

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.250 
back-to-back you can have four sets of
forward<00:02:42.750> gears<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.530> reverse<00:02:44.040> gear<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.870> for

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
forward gears and a reverse gear so for

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.470 
forward gears and a reverse gear so for
example<00:02:46.620> how<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> reverse<00:02:47.160> gear<00:02:47.580> might<00:02:47.850> work<00:02:48.150> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
example how a reverse gear might work is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.320 
example how a reverse gear might work is
you'll<00:02:49.350> have<00:02:49.410> your<00:02:49.590> input<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> Sun

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you'll have your input going to the Sun

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
you'll have your input going to the Sun
gear<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.350> middle<00:02:52.590> here<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:53.310> be

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
gear in the middle here so that will be

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.330 
gear in the middle here so that will be
rotating<00:02:54.000> clockwise<00:02:54.770> then<00:02:55.770> you'll<00:02:56.130> have

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
rotating clockwise then you'll have

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.170 
rotating clockwise then you'll have
these<00:02:57.920> planet<00:02:58.920> gears<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.520> they're<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.090> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
these planet gears and they're going to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.550 
these planet gears and they're going to
be<00:03:00.239> fixed<00:03:00.780> you're<00:03:00.930> going<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.110> hold<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
be fixed you're going to hold the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.860 
be fixed you're going to hold the
carrier<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.160> place<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> clutch<00:03:03.570> that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
carrier in place with a clutch that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.860 
carrier in place with a clutch that
doesn't<00:03:04.380> allow<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.950> move<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
doesn't allow that to move so as that

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.790 
doesn't allow that to move so as that
rotates<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.590> direction<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.230> ring<00:03:10.230> gear<00:03:10.590> is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
rotates this direction the ring gear is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.160 
rotates this direction the ring gear is
clear<00:03:11.070> rotate<00:03:11.459> another<00:03:12.239> direction<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.020> can

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
clear rotate another direction you can

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.199 
clear rotate another direction you can
think<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.590> kind<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.489> if<00:03:14.700> my

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
think of it kind of like this if if my

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.250 
think of it kind of like this if if my
hand<00:03:15.510> here<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.430> Sun<00:03:17.430> gear<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:19.019> going

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
hand here is the Sun gear and it's going

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.430 
hand here is the Sun gear and it's going
to<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.890> direction<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:21.150> my<00:03:21.870> other<00:03:22.049> hand

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to go this direction then my other hand

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.830 
to go this direction then my other hand
will<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.130> ring<00:03:23.310> gear<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.000> as<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.390> hand<00:03:24.630> goes

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
will be the ring gear so as my hand goes

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.340 
will be the ring gear so as my hand goes
this<00:03:25.110> direction<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:26.400> turns<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.660> direction

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
this direction this turns this direction

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.910 
this direction this turns this direction
and<00:03:28.530> causes<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.610> move<00:03:29.760> back<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.769> goes

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
and causes this to move back so it goes

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.530 
and causes this to move back so it goes
the<00:03:32.070> opposite<00:03:32.489> direction<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:33.150> will<00:03:33.480> be

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the opposite direction that will be

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.539 
the opposite direction that will be
connected<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.650> transmission<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.370> back

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
connected to your transmission go back

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.710 
connected to your transmission go back
to<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.790> wheels<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.420> you'll<00:03:36.570> go

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
to your wheels and so you'll go

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.970 
to your wheels and so you'll go
backwards<00:03:37.200> rather<00:03:37.440> than<00:03:37.620> forwards<00:03:39.590> now<00:03:40.590> with

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
backwards rather than forwards now with

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.460 
backwards rather than forwards now with
a<00:03:41.010> manual<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.390> once<00:03:42.930> again<00:03:43.080> you're<00:03:43.320> going<00:03:43.350> to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
a manual so once again you're going to

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.680 
a manual so once again you're going to
multiple<00:03:44.040> sets<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.850> gears<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.209> choose<00:03:45.420> from

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
multiple sets of gears to choose from

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.610 
multiple sets of gears to choose from
and<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.080> going<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.290> work<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.530> little

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
and it's going to work a little

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.039 
and it's going to work a little
differently<00:03:47.330> you're<00:03:48.330> actually<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.870> put

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
differently you're actually going to put

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.289 
differently you're actually going to put
yourself<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.799> different<00:03:49.980> gear<00:03:50.310> ratio<00:03:50.730> so

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
yourself in a different gear ratio so

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.670 
yourself in a different gear ratio so
you're<00:03:51.390> going<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.630> your<00:03:51.810> engine<00:03:52.200> here

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
you're going to have your engine here

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.880 
you're going to have your engine here
and<00:03:53.030> connect<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.360> end<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.890> it's

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
and connect it to the end of that it's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.229 
and connect it to the end of that it's
going<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.130> be<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> gear<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.890> gear<00:03:59.430> it's

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
going to be a gear and this gear it's

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.580 
going to be a gear and this gear it's
going<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> be<00:04:01.350> connected<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.930> shaft<00:04:03.930> here

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
going to be connected to a shaft here

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
going to be connected to a shaft here
and<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:06.120> shaft<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.600> pretty<00:04:06.810> much<00:04:06.900> going<00:04:07.170> to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
and this shaft is pretty much going to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.199 
and this shaft is pretty much going to
always<00:04:07.410> be<00:04:07.590> spinning<00:04:08.220> at<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.519> engine<00:04:08.880> speed

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
always be spinning at the engine speed

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.690 
always be spinning at the engine speed
so<00:04:10.200> whatever<00:04:10.500> speed<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.100> rotating<00:04:11.579> at

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
so whatever speed this is rotating at

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.069 
so whatever speed this is rotating at
this<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.180> rotate<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> opposite

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
this is going to rotate in the opposite

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.170 
this is going to rotate in the opposite
direction<00:04:13.310> now<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.060> be

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
direction now this is going to be

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.110 
direction now this is going to be
connected<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.840> your<00:04:15.930> gears<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.609> example

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
connected to your gears so for example

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.159 
connected to your gears so for example
we<00:04:18.450> can<00:04:18.690> call<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.739> one<00:04:19.799> first<00:04:20.640> gear<00:04:21.169> this

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
we can call this one first gear this

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.870 
we can call this one first gear this
green<00:04:22.590> gear<00:04:22.950> right<00:04:23.099> here<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.580> this

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
green gear right here and this

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.960 
green gear right here and this
here<00:04:24.030> right<00:04:24.180> here<00:04:24.510> second<00:04:25.080> gear<00:04:25.590> now<00:04:26.580> what

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
here right here second gear now what

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.990 
here right here second gear now what
happens<00:04:27.420> is<00:04:27.750> these<00:04:28.530> two<00:04:29.010> gears<00:04:29.370> are<00:04:29.610> always

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
happens is these two gears are always

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.670 
happens is these two gears are always
going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.330> be<00:04:30.390> rotating<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.290> they're<00:04:31.560> going

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
going to be rotating and they're going

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.290 
going to be rotating and they're going
to<00:04:31.740> be<00:04:31.800> rotating<00:04:31.950> on<00:04:32.460> your<00:04:32.610> transmission

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
to be rotating on your transmission

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.050 
to be rotating on your transmission
shaft<00:04:33.630> around<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.190> here's<00:04:35.790> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
shaft around it so here's the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.000 
shaft around it so here's the
transmission<00:04:36.800> or<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:38.100> output<00:04:38.490> shaft<00:04:38.760> sorry

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
transmission or your output shaft sorry

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.010 
transmission or your output shaft sorry
so<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.310> going<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.520> go<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:42.750> your

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
so this is going to go to your

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.020 
so this is going to go to your
differential<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:45.180> your<00:04:45.270> tires<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:47.580> drive<00:04:47.790> them

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
differential to your tires to drive them

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.490 
differential to your tires to drive them
so<00:04:48.890> you're<00:04:49.890> what<00:04:50.130> you're<00:04:50.250> going<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> do<00:04:50.670> is

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
so you're what you're going to do is

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.630 
so you're what you're going to do is
remember<00:04:52.500> these<00:04:52.680> are<00:04:52.860> always<00:04:53.250> going<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> be

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
remember these are always going to be

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.390 
remember these are always going to be
rotating<00:04:54.180> at<00:04:54.420> your<00:04:54.570> engine<00:04:54.960> speed<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.620> so

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
rotating at your engine speed and so

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.460 
rotating at your engine speed and so
you're<00:04:56.730> going<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> press<00:04:57.390> in<00:04:57.570> your<00:04:57.720> clutch<00:04:58.050> and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
you're going to press in your clutch and

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.920 
you're going to press in your clutch and
that's<00:04:59.010> going<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.250> pull<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.720> transmission

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
that's going to pull the transmission

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.080 
that's going to pull the transmission
away<00:05:01.530> from<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> engine<00:05:01.890> so<00:05:02.190> they're<00:05:02.310> not<00:05:02.490> no

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
away from the engine so they're not no

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.140 
away from the engine so they're not no
longer<00:05:03.240> connected<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:05.580> what<00:05:06.030> you're

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
longer connected and then what you're

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.750 
longer connected and then what you're
going<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.330> be<00:05:06.390> able<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.600> do<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.370> either<00:05:08.370> select

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
going to be able to do is either select

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.990 
going to be able to do is either select
first<00:05:09.540> or<00:05:09.930> second<00:05:10.560> here<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:10.800> you'll<00:05:11.640> push<00:05:11.850> the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
first or second here so you'll push the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.250 
first or second here so you'll push the
gear<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.480> I'll<00:05:12.660> move<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.110> in<00:05:14.120> contact<00:05:15.260> so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
gear and I'll move this in contact so

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.650 
gear and I'll move this in contact so
this<00:05:16.650> right<00:05:16.860> here<00:05:16.920> is<00:05:17.220> called<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.880> collar<00:05:18.240> and

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
this right here is called a collar and

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.900 
this right here is called a collar and
it's<00:05:19.080> got<00:05:19.290> what<00:05:19.530> they<00:05:19.650> call<00:05:19.860> dog<00:05:20.190> gears<00:05:20.520> on<00:05:20.730> it

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
it's got what they call dog gears on it

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.810 
it's got what they call dog gears on it
so<00:05:21.510> as<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.990> shift<00:05:22.050> into<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.590> gear<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.130> will

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
so as you shift into a gear it will

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.970 
so as you shift into a gear it will
connect<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.480> either<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.290> first<00:05:25.560> year<00:05:25.800> or<00:05:25.860> the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
connect to either this first year or the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.520 
connect to either this first year or the
second<00:05:26.340> gear<00:05:26.490> say<00:05:26.760> this<00:05:26.970> has<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.210> ratio<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.870> two

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
second gear say this has a ratio of two

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.030 
second gear say this has a ratio of two
point<00:05:28.830> five<00:05:29.040> to<00:05:29.430> one<00:05:30.230> so<00:05:31.230> you'll<00:05:31.590> connect

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
point five to one so you'll connect

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.140 
point five to one so you'll connect
these<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.940> dog<00:05:33.210> gear<00:05:33.600> so<00:05:33.900> it'll<00:05:35.150> connect

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
these this dog gear so it'll connect

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.430 
these this dog gear so it'll connect
here<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.810> then<00:05:37.530> your<00:05:38.390> wheels<00:05:39.390> will<00:05:39.660> rotate<00:05:39.990> at

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
here and then your wheels will rotate at

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.160 
here and then your wheels will rotate at
the<00:05:40.470> same<00:05:40.800> rate<00:05:41.580> as<00:05:41.880> as<00:05:42.150> whatever<00:05:42.750> gear<00:05:42.990> race

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
the same rate as as whatever gear race

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.060 
the same rate as as whatever gear race
you<00:05:43.410> have<00:05:43.650> match<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.730> engine<00:05:45.110> so<00:05:46.110> when<00:05:46.620> you

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
you have match to the engine so when you

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.890 
you have match to the engine so when you
do<00:05:47.280> shift<00:05:47.670> and<00:05:48.030> you<00:05:48.360> hear<00:05:48.510> that<00:05:48.630> grinding

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
do shift and you hear that grinding

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.130 
do shift and you hear that grinding
noise<00:05:49.290> it's<00:05:49.560> not<00:05:49.770> actually<00:05:50.550> gear<00:05:50.880> teeth<00:05:51.140> not

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
noise it's not actually gear teeth not

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.050 
noise it's not actually gear teeth not
meshing<00:05:52.440> correctly<00:05:53.040> together<00:05:53.370> it's<00:05:53.580> it's

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
meshing correctly together it's it's

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.360 
meshing correctly together it's it's
really<00:05:54.420> this<00:05:54.630> dog<00:05:54.960> gear<00:05:55.380> and<00:05:55.560> you're<00:05:56.070> trying

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
really this dog gear and you're trying

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.210 
really this dog gear and you're trying
to<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:57.210> match<00:05:57.450> its<00:05:57.720> speed<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.410> speeds<00:05:59.010> aren't

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
to to match its speed and speeds aren't

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.570 
to to match its speed and speeds aren't
the<00:05:59.490> same<00:05:59.730> so<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.390> get<00:06:00.990> that<00:06:01.110> air<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.770> sound

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
the same so you get that air and sound

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.420 
the same so you get that air and sound
so<00:06:03.290> anyway<00:06:04.290> so<00:06:04.350> that's<00:06:04.620> how<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:04.890> works

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
so anyway so that's how that works

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.780 
so anyway so that's how that works
um<00:06:06.200> now<00:06:07.200> you're<00:06:07.530> going<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.770> have<00:06:07.920> forward<00:06:08.580> and

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
um now you're going to have forward and

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.440 
um now you're going to have forward and
reverse<00:06:09.180> gears<00:06:09.600> so<00:06:10.850> this<00:06:11.850> is<00:06:12.000> just<00:06:12.210> a<00:06:12.270> little

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
reverse gears so this is just a little

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.060 
reverse gears so this is just a little
drawing<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:12.780> help<00:06:12.930> explain<00:06:13.290> how<00:06:13.320> that<00:06:13.620> happens

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
drawing to help explain how that happens

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.380 
drawing to help explain how that happens
um<00:06:14.540> you've<00:06:15.540> got<00:06:15.750> your<00:06:15.900> engine<00:06:16.230> coming<00:06:16.560> here<00:06:17.390> so

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
um you've got your engine coming here so

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.640 
um you've got your engine coming here so
this<00:06:18.570> is<00:06:18.750> going<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.050> be<00:06:19.110> rotating<00:06:19.260> in<00:06:19.470> this

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
this is going to be rotating in this

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.500 
this is going to be rotating in this
direction<00:06:19.850> then<00:06:20.850> you're<00:06:21.030> going<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.210> have<00:06:21.330> this

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
direction then you're going to have this

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.780 
direction then you're going to have this
shaft<00:06:21.930> here<00:06:22.350> down<00:06:22.560> at<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.710> bottom<00:06:22.770> so<00:06:23.670> that's

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
shaft here down at the bottom so that's

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.950 
shaft here down at the bottom so that's
going<00:06:23.940> to<00:06:24.030> be<00:06:24.090> rotating<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.600> opposite

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
going to be rotating the opposite

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.600 
going to be rotating the opposite
direction<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.590> that<00:06:25.920> gears<00:06:26.280> going<00:06:26.430> to<00:06:26.520> rotate

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
direction so that gears going to rotate

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.430 
direction so that gears going to rotate
the<00:06:26.910> opposite<00:06:27.240> direction<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:27.780> your<00:06:28.200> output

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
the opposite direction so your output

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.110 
the opposite direction so your output
shaft<00:06:29.130> is<00:06:29.340> going<00:06:29.520> to<00:06:29.580> go<00:06:29.700> in<00:06:29.880> the<00:06:29.970> same

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
shaft is going to go in the same

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.010 
shaft is going to go in the same
direction<00:06:30.360> as<00:06:30.950> your<00:06:31.950> engine<00:06:32.460> shaft<00:06:33.150> so<00:06:33.990> that

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
direction as your engine shaft so that

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.780 
direction as your engine shaft so that
means<00:06:34.530> you're<00:06:34.680> crossing<00:06:35.010> me<00:06:35.100> going<00:06:35.310> forward

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
means you're crossing me going forward

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.640 
means you're crossing me going forward
now<00:06:36.479> put<00:06:36.870> it<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:37.020> reverse

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
now put it in reverse

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.070 
now put it in reverse
you're<00:06:37.800> going<00:06:37.949> to<00:06:38.010> have<00:06:38.300> the<00:06:39.300> same<00:06:39.660> thing<00:06:39.930> with

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
you're going to have the same thing with

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.450 
you're going to have the same thing with
the<00:06:40.139> engines<00:06:40.410> upon<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:40.710> same<00:06:40.889> direction

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
the engines upon the same direction

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.150 
the engines upon the same direction
you've<00:06:41.970> got<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.240> same<00:06:42.389> shaft<00:06:42.780> but<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.710> between

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
you've got the same shaft but in between

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.400 
you've got the same shaft but in between
the<00:06:45.320> final<00:06:46.320> gear<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:48.020> output<00:06:49.020> gear

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
the final gear the and the output gear

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.530 
the final gear the and the output gear
you're<00:06:49.949> going<00:06:50.100> to<00:06:50.160> have<00:06:50.370> an<00:06:50.490> idle<00:06:50.850> gear<00:06:51.060> and

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
you're going to have an idle gear and

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.850 
you're going to have an idle gear and
what<00:06:51.690> this<00:06:51.840> is<00:06:51.960> going<00:06:52.110> to<00:06:52.169> do<00:06:52.290> is<00:06:52.410> change<00:06:52.680> the

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
what this is going to do is change the

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.300 
what this is going to do is change the
direction<00:06:52.979> so<00:06:54.410> going<00:06:55.410> this<00:06:55.560> direction<00:06:55.740> that

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
direction so going this direction that

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.850 
direction so going this direction that
it<00:06:56.460> turns<00:06:56.729> same<00:06:57.419> direction<00:06:57.840> there<00:06:58.050> this<00:06:58.590> I

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
it turns same direction there this I

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.780 
it turns same direction there this I
don't<00:06:59.040> give<00:06:59.160> us<00:06:59.220> going<00:06:59.370> to<00:06:59.430> turn<00:06:59.610> that<00:06:59.729> around

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
don't give us going to turn that around

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.850 
don't give us going to turn that around
and<00:07:00.270> so<00:07:00.540> then<00:07:00.690> your<00:07:00.810> output<00:07:00.960> shaft<00:07:01.470> is<00:07:01.680> going

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
and so then your output shaft is going

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.980 
and so then your output shaft is going
to<00:07:01.919> be<00:07:02.070> rotating<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.940> reverse<00:07:03.210> direction<00:07:03.449> as

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
to be rotating the reverse direction as

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.600 
to be rotating the reverse direction as
your<00:07:04.169> engine<00:07:04.530> so<00:07:04.919> you're<00:07:05.010> going<00:07:05.130> to<00:07:05.160> be<00:07:05.280> moving

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
your engine so you're going to be moving

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.270 
your engine so you're going to be moving
backwards<00:07:06.090> now<00:07:07.020> if<00:07:07.290> you<00:07:07.440> ever<00:07:07.590> try<00:07:07.889> to<00:07:07.949> put

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
backwards now if you ever try to put

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.469 
backwards now if you ever try to put
your<00:07:08.460> car<00:07:08.669> into<00:07:08.790> reverse<00:07:08.910> while<00:07:09.330> you're

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
your car into reverse while you're

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.060 
your car into reverse while you're
moving<00:07:09.570> forwards<00:07:10.199> you're<00:07:10.680> not<00:07:10.830> going<00:07:10.949> to<00:07:11.010> be

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
moving forwards you're not going to be

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.650 
moving forwards you're not going to be
able<00:07:11.340> to<00:07:11.520> because<00:07:12.060> you<00:07:12.270> have<00:07:12.300> to<00:07:12.479> remember

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
able to because you have to remember

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.969 
able to because you have to remember
that<00:07:12.990> these<00:07:13.169> are<00:07:13.350> always<00:07:13.530> going<00:07:13.889> to<00:07:13.919> be

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 
that these are always going to be

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:16.219 
that these are always going to be
rotating<00:07:14.580> in<00:07:14.669> the<00:07:15.210> direction<00:07:15.449> of<00:07:15.660> the<00:07:15.780> engine

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
rotating in the direction of the engine

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.580 
rotating in the direction of the engine
so<00:07:16.800> if<00:07:17.190> if<00:07:17.460> you're<00:07:17.729> moving<00:07:17.910> forward<00:07:18.419> and<00:07:18.900> this

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
so if if you're moving forward and this

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.270 
so if if you're moving forward and this
is<00:07:19.650> moving<00:07:20.220> the<00:07:20.460> direction<00:07:21.800> this<00:07:22.800> is<00:07:22.979> moving

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
is moving the direction this is moving

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.590 
is moving the direction this is moving
in<00:07:23.430> a<00:07:23.520> forward<00:07:23.669> direction<00:07:24.150> and<00:07:24.270> then<00:07:24.449> your

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
in a forward direction and then your

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000 
in a forward direction and then your
reverse<00:07:24.810> shaft<00:07:25.080> is<00:07:25.289> going<00:07:25.590> to<00:07:25.650> be<00:07:25.710> going<00:07:25.919> the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010 
reverse shaft is going to be going the

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.710 
reverse shaft is going to be going the
opposite<00:07:26.310> direction<00:07:26.430> it's<00:07:27.240> going<00:07:27.389> to<00:07:27.449> clash

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 
opposite direction it's going to clash

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.969 
opposite direction it's going to clash
no<00:07:28.020> matter<00:07:28.169> what<00:07:28.410> you're<00:07:28.620> not<00:07:28.710> gonna<00:07:28.830> be<00:07:28.919> able

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
no matter what you're not gonna be able

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:33.800 
no matter what you're not gonna be able
to<00:07:29.070> get<00:07:29.190> those<00:07:29.400> in<00:07:31.610> so<00:07:32.610> that's<00:07:32.970> how<00:07:33.570> an

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
to get those in so that's how an

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.100 
to get those in so that's how an
automatic<00:07:34.440> differs<00:07:35.010> from<00:07:35.250> a<00:07:35.580> manual<00:07:36.110> and

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
automatic differs from a manual and

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.810 
automatic differs from a manual and
there<00:07:37.380> are<00:07:37.650> added<00:07:38.580> benefits<00:07:39.150> for<00:07:39.449> each

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
there are added benefits for each

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.250 
there are added benefits for each
manuals<00:07:41.820> you<00:07:42.419> used<00:07:42.690> to<00:07:42.810> be<00:07:42.900> able<00:07:42.990> to<00:07:43.110> get

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
manuals you used to be able to get

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.250 
manuals you used to be able to get
better<00:07:43.440> mileage<00:07:43.680> with<00:07:44.039> because<00:07:44.430> of<00:07:44.760> the

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260 
better mileage with because of the

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.960 
better mileage with because of the
losses<00:07:46.260> in<00:07:46.470> the<00:07:46.500> torque<00:07:46.860> converter<00:07:46.979> but<00:07:47.729> now

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:47.970 
losses in the torque converter but now
