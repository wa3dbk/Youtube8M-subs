00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.679
 good hello to all dear youtube friends 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.990
 welcome back together with the boss wells 86 today 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.789
 a very very particular and expensive video 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.760
 friends who are fans of HDC or dear friends who are there 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.830
 like to look around in homes 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.110
 Android smartphone manufacturers 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.880
 this video is dedicated to me 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.330
 very dear friend of mine who 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.490
 I don't mention his name under e 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.290
 surname so a little bit for privacy not 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.310
 you never know about going to violate your privacy 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.650
 even a friend 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.630
 but in short he knows that he always follows the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.670
 I know my video is watching it too 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.650
 so this time it's this video 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.860
 dedicated to him and I already know that he was 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.310
 pulling the hair to the thermal of 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.710
 youtube 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.560
 today we have an htc juan n 8 in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 gold colors is a htc one m8 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.370
 colorless to are and ga meta and so far 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.890
 you say but that is also seen from the video 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.350
 clearly in the meantime I wanted to show you 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.989
 as the coloring of home time happens 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.179
 there on juan m8 is a very correlation 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.899
 very nice interesting to me 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:13.009
 also very fine not tacky with one 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.590
 coloring that does not bother even to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.170
 who maybe they may not like how 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.869
 color because they have in mind iphone 5s 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.569
 and iphone 6 6 plus in short this noro 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.659
 very nice in my opinion of home htc 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.569
 having said that we have a particularity 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.240
 of these two smartphones or the htc 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:37.069
 juan n 8 in gold color a made in 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.540
 taiwan 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:45.080
 the htc one m8 gunmetal is a myth 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.800
 china then what are the differences 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.710
 Between a well in China is a made in Taiwan or 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.620
 better still but htc 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.190
 he does both in china and taiwan his 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.650
 devices 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.630
 well that's for pro users or 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.560
 those home fan users happen there 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 they will know very well how in htc one m7 ci 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.170
 it was a very marked difference 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 between the military but in medicine and 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.780
 medicine had materials that were not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.360
 well built like me from taiwan e 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.000
 even on medicine there were the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.010
 famous green bar violet halos on 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.820
 camera when we went to shoot 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.340
 his m8 photographs fortunately the only one 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.970
 difference between a meditates medicine medicine 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.610
 and the tone of the display on juan m8 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.489
 goldberg made in taiwan has a display 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.190
 much colder as a shade of 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.610
 whites is in my opinion much nicer and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.780
 medicine to a tendency to yellow on 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.350
 display 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.060
 these are personal tastes 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.600
 attention i am not saying that made 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.730
 in taiwan is better as a display and 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 as quality compared to made in china 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.019
 seen only saying that this 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.810
 roma sale is more tending to blue 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.110
 more tending to cold colors and therefore a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.360
 I like most the 8 gun metal and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.360
 more tending to warm colors or to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.330
 pale yellow on white and not me 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.980
 but maybe you like it in the meantime 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.130
 how to know if yours 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.160
 htc device is humanitarian in medicine 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.959
 let's take our beautiful package 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.209
 I will hopefully get into focus 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.510
 here is how you can see on the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.150
 package 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.930
 I love the writing of our origin 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.629
 device 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 in this case my m8 gold a in 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.620
 therefore precisely or these characteristics 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.959
 of display 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.030
 I will try and I don't know if I can 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.459
 also saw that you are watching 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.640
 this video from the video camera here is 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.129
 an artificial lighting system 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.769
 especially for videos so I don't know if in 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.519
 room you will notice this difference of 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.730
 display that I already immediately see in 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:07.620
 sharp way I see abysmally 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:11.099
 between the two smartphones htc one m8 gold a 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.829
 a very precise white really white 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.669
 also like balancing while the bikes 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:21.090
 that in the middle most tend to greenish 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.610
 yellow bars there is a difference are 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 both maximum brightness and is one 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.250
 very marked difference between the two 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.680
 smartphone precisely on the white this 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.560
 in fact it does not indicate that 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.310
 this is worse than this is 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.889
 in short, only a chronicle a 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.380
 show you also the differences between the two 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.770
 display now I want to approach a 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.050
 both display always that 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.530
 it serves something because I repeat it is not 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.130
 very easy to show in the room 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.780
 what I see here live here 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.780
 we have the bill and you can see it here 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.150
 we embodied look at the bar 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.910
 google search or the key 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.370
 go and look for something you notice 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.580
 blatantly the difference between this 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.250
 blue and this blue and also how 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.960
 all whites are balanced in 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.569
 differently 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.940
 the two smartphones we go to the home that 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.729
 has given itself with the same packets 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.520
 and with the same distribution of 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.680
 icons don't look osapp you see that 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.449
 differentiates look also the icon of the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.800
 browser 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.889
 this blue against this blue 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.360
 also look at the camera i 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.500
 two smartphones change brightness 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.560
 put at maximum in both 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.660
 smartphone here is the result 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.690
 in short, you have understood how it is 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.470
 difference between two smartphones is 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.830
 always home htc always a htc or anime 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.410
 8 but a made in taiwan or the m8 gold 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.630
 and a medicine or the cannata 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.389
 then raga for today is all I hope that 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.090
 this video is interesting and helps you 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.009
 when buying an htc one m8 io 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.080
 I prefer the display slightly more 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.030
 cold though it is not certain that it is 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.159
 clearly the best for you a 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.159
 salute I can not war 86
