00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
video series that we're doing on speed

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
video series that we're doing on speed
lights<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.220> today<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.670> talking<00:00:29.699> about

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
lights and today we're talking about

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.110 
lights and today we're talking about
flash<00:00:30.750> power<00:00:31.219> but<00:00:32.219> before<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.669> talk<00:00:32.700> about

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
flash power but before we talk about

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
flash power but before we talk about
flash<00:00:33.450> power<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:34.079> important<00:00:34.590> things

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
flash power there's two important things

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.310 
flash power there's two important things
that<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.070> need<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.309> talk<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:36.079> with<00:00:37.079> flat

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that we need to talk about with flat

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
that we need to talk about with flat
with<00:00:37.530> our<00:00:37.710> speed<00:00:38.399> lights<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> those<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
with our speed lights and those are the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880 
with our speed lights and those are the
limitations<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.899> speed<00:00:40.200> light<00:00:40.410> tab<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
limitations that speed light tab and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
limitations that speed light tab and
this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.160> why<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.370> video<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:41.969> important

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
this is why this video is so important

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
this is why this video is so important
so<00:00:42.570> Annie<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.110> those<00:00:43.379> limitations<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so Annie what are those limitations that

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.010 
so Annie what are those limitations that
are<00:00:44.340> speedlights<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.030> okay<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> first<00:00:45.809> one

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
are speedlights have okay the first one

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
are speedlights have okay the first one
is<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.530> battery<00:00:47.070> operated<00:00:47.100> by

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is that they are battery operated by

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
is that they are battery operated by
double<00:00:47.940> aids<00:00:48.090> okay<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> second<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
double aids okay and the second one is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.600 
double aids okay and the second one is
that<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.070> very<00:00:51.000> slow<00:00:51.390> recycle<00:00:51.960> times

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
that they very slow recycle times

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
that they very slow recycle times
depending<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> power<00:00:54.329> you're<00:00:54.629> using<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
depending on the power you're using so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.729 
depending on the power you're using so
what's<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> problem<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.949> double<00:00:56.250> A's<00:00:56.449> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
what's the problem with double A's I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
what's the problem with double A's I
don't<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> carry<00:00:59.100> around<00:00:59.160> 800<00:00:59.910> double<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
don't want to carry around 800 double is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.779 
don't want to carry around 800 double is
in<00:01:00.539> my<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:00.989> pocket<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.489> we're<00:01:02.640> always

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
in my in my pocket so if we're always

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
in my in my pocket so if we're always
shooting<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.329> full<00:01:03.510> power<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.530> mean

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
shooting at full power or where I mean

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
shooting at full power or where I mean
we're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.400> quantum<00:01:06.119> batteries<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.750> we're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
we're going quantum batteries and we're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
we're going quantum batteries and we're
wasting<00:01:07.500> time<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> recycle<00:01:08.760> we're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
wasting time because the recycle we're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.560 
wasting time because the recycle we're
losing<00:01:09.750> pictures<00:01:10.229> because<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> recycle<00:01:11.040> time

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
losing pictures because the recycle time

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.850 
losing pictures because the recycle time
sometimes<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.869> 2-3<00:01:13.380> seconds<00:01:13.710> depending

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
sometimes can take 2-3 seconds depending

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.789 
sometimes can take 2-3 seconds depending
on<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.430> battery<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.810> let's<00:01:16.020> dive<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.500> flash

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
on your battery so let's dive into flash

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.670 
on your battery so let's dive into flash
power<00:01:17.119> okay<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.180> let's<00:01:18.630> say<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.229> are

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
power okay so let's say that we are

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
power okay so let's say that we are
we've<00:01:20.220> got<00:01:20.369> our<00:01:20.490> light<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> stand<00:01:21.299> we've

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
we've got our light on the stand we've

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
we've got our light on the stand we've
got<00:01:22.080> our<00:01:22.229> model<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.250> word<00:01:23.490> we're

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
got our model there and word we're

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
got our model there and word we're
shooting<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> full<00:01:24.540> power<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.799> want<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
shooting it full power and I want to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.429 
shooting it full power and I want to
save<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.850> battery<00:01:27.210> life<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
save some battery life I know that if I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.429 
save some battery life I know that if I
go<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:29.009> full<00:01:29.460> power<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.240> half<00:01:30.540> power<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.170> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
go from full power to half power that is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.429 
go from full power to half power that is
one<00:01:31.860> stop<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.790> light<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:34.140> want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.380> from

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
one stop of light if i want to go from

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
one stop of light if i want to go from
half<00:01:34.740> power<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.159> quarter<00:01:35.490> power<00:01:35.670> one

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
half power to quarter power one

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560 
half power to quarter power one
stoplight<00:01:36.590> quarter<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.829> eight<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.549> 16<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.299> 30

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
stoplight quarter to eight to 16 to 30

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
stoplight quarter to eight to 16 to 30
seconds<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> 60<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.890> relationship

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
seconds to 60 for the relationship

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.780 
seconds to 60 for the relationship
between<00:01:41.880> each<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.659> those<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:44.310> stoplight

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
between each of those is one stoplight

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.330 
between each of those is one stoplight
so<00:01:45.210> let's<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.600> let's<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.840> back<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> example

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
so let's so let's go back to the example

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
so let's so let's go back to the example
we've<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> flash<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> stand<00:01:48.689> we've

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
we've got the flash on the stand we've

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.389 
we've got the flash on the stand we've
got<00:01:49.140> our<00:01:49.259> model<00:01:49.680> properly<00:01:50.520> exposed<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.540> f/8

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
got our model properly exposed at f/8

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.149 
got our model properly exposed at f/8
full<00:01:53.399> power<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.820> full<00:01:54.149> power<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.890> save

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
full power at full power we can save

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.209

same exact exposure Matt Matt so in
layman's<00:02:50.370> terms<00:02:50.640> okay<00:02:51.090> one<00:02:51.989> stop<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.800> flash

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129

power<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.000> exact<00:02:54.360> same<00:02:54.629> thing<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.140> 1<00:02:55.530> stop

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920

power is the exact same thing as 1 stop
of<00:02:56.160> aperture<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:57.080> once<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.440> know<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.739> your
