00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
actually look a little darker with the
camera<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.700> showing<00:02:09.119> him<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> little

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
camera you know showing him a little

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.770 
camera you know showing him a little
bright<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.920> these<00:02:11.069> things<00:02:11.340> sick<00:02:11.670> man<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.239> was

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
bright but these things sick man I was

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.449 
bright but these things sick man I was
trying<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:12.989> look<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.319> them<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
trying to look for them on you

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.220 
trying to look for them on you
in<00:02:15.459> review<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> could<00:02:16.750> see<00:02:16.900> how<00:02:17.020> they<00:02:17.140> were

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
in review so I could see how they were

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.580 
in review so I could see how they were
probably<00:02:17.440> good<00:02:17.680> before<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.040> got<00:02:18.220> mine<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:19.590> it's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
probably good before I got mine but it's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.400 
probably good before I got mine but it's
so<00:02:20.709> hard<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> find<00:02:21.220> man<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.840> guess<00:02:23.050> I'd<00:02:23.230> be

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
so hard to find man so I guess I'd be

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.050 
so hard to find man so I guess I'd be
the<00:02:23.500> one<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> showcase<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.910> saw

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
the one to showcase them I think I saw

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.090 
the one to showcase them I think I saw
