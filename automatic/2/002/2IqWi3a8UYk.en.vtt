night I made this quite simple I didn't

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.430 
night I made this quite simple I didn't
video<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:37.650> because<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.420> late<00:00:39.690> 10<00:00:40.260> o'clock

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

to<00:00:41.250> four<00:00:41.550> hours<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> fabricate<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:44.300> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to four hours to fabricate that it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680 
to four hours to fabricate that it's
very<00:00:45.570> similar<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:47.220> shape<00:00:47.250> why<00:00:47.699> did<00:00:48.000> reason

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
very similar to the shape why did reason

headlight mount and that produces a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
mount there for an indicator I just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
mount there for an indicator I just
bought<00:01:16.440> them<00:01:16.590> off<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.580> some

see<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> welding<00:01:21.630> hack<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.290> mine

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
see by the welding hack it's not mine

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.170 
see by the welding hack it's not mine
and<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> did<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.789> one

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and all I did was the other one

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.389 
and all I did was the other one
I've<00:01:27.329> put<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.719> there<00:01:27.899> just<00:01:28.189> chopped<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> off

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
I've put it in there just chopped it off

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.709 
I've put it in there just chopped it off
to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> level<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.750> produced<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.560> perfect

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
to the level and that produced a perfect

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.080 
to the level and that produced a perfect
noggin<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:34.680> bolt<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.850> was

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
noggin to bolt through and then this was

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.859 
noggin to bolt through and then this was
just<00:01:36.270> sheet<00:01:36.689> metal<00:01:36.929> literally<00:01:38.149> just<00:01:39.149> cut<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just sheet metal literally just cut the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.310 
just sheet metal literally just cut the
shape<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:41.240> triangle<00:01:42.240> folded<00:01:42.869> those<00:01:42.990> round

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
shape out triangle folded those round

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
shape out triangle folded those round
with<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.530> folding<00:01:43.859> pliers<00:01:44.130> drill<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> through

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
with the folding pliers drill it through

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.950 
with the folding pliers drill it through
and<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> middle<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.600> there's<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.719> sleeve

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and in the middle there there's a sleeve

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
and in the middle there there's a sleeve
all<00:01:49.469> I<00:01:49.499> found<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> tube<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.579> metal<00:01:50.850> tube<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
all I found was a tube a metal tube that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
all I found was a tube a metal tube that
used<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.109> go<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.499> rubber<00:01:52.679> Bush<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
used to go through a rubber Bush you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
used to go through a rubber Bush you
know<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.609> stops<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> bolts<00:01:54.630> squashing

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
know the kind stops the bolts squashing

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.169 
know the kind stops the bolts squashing
up<00:01:55.109> a<00:01:55.289> rubber<00:01:55.560> Bush<00:01:55.770> too<00:01:55.979> much<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> metal

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
up a rubber Bush too much and the metal

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.989 
up a rubber Bush too much and the metal
tube<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> marginally<00:01:58.249> longer<00:01:59.249> than<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
tube is just marginally longer than this

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.969 
tube is just marginally longer than this
which<00:02:00.929> effectively<00:02:01.590> creates<00:02:02.780> movement<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
which effectively creates movement so it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.559 
which effectively creates movement so it
doesn't<00:02:05.249> seize<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.329> you're<00:02:06.390> making

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
doesn't seize up and when you're making

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.540 
doesn't seize up and when you're making
these<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.499> make<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.829> pretty

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
these you do have to make that pretty

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.980 
these you do have to make that pretty
wibbly-wobbly<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.539> obviously<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.929> all

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
wibbly-wobbly because obviously it all

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.780 
wibbly-wobbly because obviously it all
gets<00:02:10.170> hot<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.530> seizes<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.610> don't

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
gets hot and seizes up and you don't

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
gets hot and seizes up and you don't
want<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.030> season<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.690> position<00:02:12.840> when

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
want that season in that position when

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.559 
want that season in that position when
it's<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.100> along<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.850> still<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
it's going along we're still that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.180 
it's going along we're still that
position<00:02:16.020> which<00:02:16.200> means<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.770> won't<00:02:16.890> be<00:02:16.980> going

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
position which means you won't be going

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.400 
position which means you won't be going
along<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.819> they<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.090> made<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.990> last<00:02:19.140> night's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
along so they are made that last night's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.750 
along so they are made that last night's
bit<00:02:19.590> daft<00:02:21.110> there's<00:02:22.110> more<00:02:22.260> ratash<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.610> can

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
bit daft there's more ratash as you can

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870 
bit daft there's more ratash as you can
see<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> paints
