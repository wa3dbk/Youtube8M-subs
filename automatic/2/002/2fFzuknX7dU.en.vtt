sucking<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> oils<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> says<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sucking up the oils on it says that it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.069 
sucking up the oils on it says that it
is<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.560> pore<00:01:52.950> minimizer<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.270> yes<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.780> definitely

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
is a pore minimizer so yes I definitely

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
is a pore minimizer so yes I definitely
agree<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.130> foundation<00:01:56.340> does<00:01:56.909> minimize

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
agree that this foundation does minimize

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
agree that this foundation does minimize
the<00:01:57.570> look<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> pore<00:01:58.229> far<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> pore

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the look of pore far as the pore

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.550 
the look of pore far as the pore
minimizing<00:01:59.399> part<00:01:59.759> yes<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.270> does<00:02:00.479> minimize<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
minimizing part yes it does minimize the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
minimizing part yes it does minimize the
appearance<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.189> pores<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.810> opinion

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
appearance of pores but in my opinion

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.150 
appearance of pores but in my opinion
after<00:02:04.579> 4<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> 5<00:02:05.939> hours<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> wear<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.860> start

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
after 4 to 5 hours of wear you can start

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.260 
after 4 to 5 hours of wear you can start
seeing<00:02:08.399> those<00:02:08.610> effects

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
seeing those effects

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180 
seeing those effects
diminishing<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:10.650> can<00:02:10.800> start<00:02:11.010> seeing

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
diminishing and you can start seeing

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
diminishing and you can start seeing
your<00:02:11.310> pores<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.350> doesn't<00:02:13.350> normally

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
your pores a bit which doesn't normally

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.710 
your pores a bit which doesn't normally
happen<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.250> me<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.670> most<00:02:14.940> foundations<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
happen to me with most foundations so

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
happen to me with most foundations so
that<00:02:15.930> was<00:02:16.170> one<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> things<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.340> didn't<00:02:17.790> like

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
that was one of the things I didn't like

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.540 
that was one of the things I didn't like
too<00:02:18.270> much<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.500> first<00:02:19.800> applied<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
too much but when I first applied it I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.270 
too much but when I first applied it I
loved<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> looked<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.530> beautiful<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:23.070> was

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
loved it it looked so beautiful I was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.790 
loved it it looked so beautiful I was
shocked<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.970> will<00:02:24.510> say<00:02:24.720> because<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.380> own

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
shocked I will say because of my own

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.950 
shocked I will say because of my own
skin<00:02:26.340> type<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> do<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.300> nourish<00:02:27.720> my

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.380 
skin type that I do have to nourish my
skin<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.860> use<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.460> really

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
skin and I have to use a really really

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.450 
skin and I have to use a really really
hydrating<00:02:30.870> primer<00:02:31.140> before<00:02:31.410> hand<00:02:31.950> because

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
hydrating primer before hand because

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.060 
hydrating primer before hand because
when<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.060> put<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.810> does<00:02:34.050> go<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.590> matte

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
when I do put it on it does go on matte

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.250 
when I do put it on it does go on matte
it<00:02:35.370> doesn't<00:02:35.850> look<00:02:35.970> luminous<00:02:36.180> at<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.810> even<00:02:37.170> if

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it doesn't look luminous at all even if

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.290 
it doesn't look luminous at all even if
I<00:02:37.350> were<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> use<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.800> Beauty<00:02:38.160> Blender<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:38.910> far<00:02:39.180> as

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
I were to use a Beauty Blender as far as

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.140 
I were to use a Beauty Blender as far as
the<00:02:39.420> coverage<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.550> medium<00:02:41.910> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the coverage it is more of a medium to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.820 
the coverage it is more of a medium to
full<00:02:42.450> coverage<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.290> definitely<00:02:43.470> be

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
full coverage you can definitely be

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.950 
full coverage you can definitely be
light<00:02:44.070> handed<00:02:44.460> with<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.030> use<00:02:45.300> less<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
light handed with it you use less of it

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.660 
light handed with it you use less of it
but<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.350> very<00:02:46.410> buildable<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.280> would<00:02:47.520> not

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
but it's very buildable but I would not

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.730 
but it's very buildable but I would not
say<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.540> super<00:02:48.930> full<00:02:49.140> coverage<00:02:49.500> I

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
say that it is super full coverage I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.910 
say that it is super full coverage I
also<00:02:50.040> did<00:02:50.370> include<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.390> clip<00:02:51.660> demo<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
also did include a little clip demo so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.400 
also did include a little clip demo so
you<00:02:52.950> guys<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.850> see<00:02:54.180> how<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.840> foundation

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
you guys can see how this foundation

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.140 
know acne that I really do like to cover
up<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.190> foundation<00:03:05.610> does<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.760> great<00:03:06.090> job

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
up so this foundation does a great job

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.930 
up so this foundation does a great job
of<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.710> does<00:03:07.950> go<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.220> more<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.910> a

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
of that and it does go on more of like a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
of that and it does go on more of like a
light<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.420> medium<00:03:09.570> coverage<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.440> after<00:03:10.740> that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
light to medium coverage but after that

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.190 
light to medium coverage but after that
you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.130> totally<00:03:11.460> build<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:13.050> I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
you can totally build it up and like I

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.900 
you can totally build it up and like I
said<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.190> medium<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.670> full

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
said it is more on the medium to full

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.420 
said it is more on the medium to full
coverage<00:03:14.940> side<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.810> isn't<00:03:16.110> crazy<00:03:16.320> full<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.100> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
coverage side it isn't crazy full so it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.530 
coverage side it isn't crazy full so it
won't<00:03:17.610> make<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.910> feel<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:18.209> you're<00:03:18.390> wearing

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
won't make you feel like you're wearing

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
won't make you feel like you're wearing
a<00:03:18.780> mask<00:03:19.190> throughout<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> day<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.670> totally

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
a mask throughout the day it totally

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.390 
a mask throughout the day it totally
feels<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:22.290> wearing<00:03:22.650> foundation<00:03:22.709> at

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
feels like I'm not wearing foundation at

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
to touch up this area right here but it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.170
