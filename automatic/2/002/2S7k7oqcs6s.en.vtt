one by blanka's cosmetics is quite small

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
one by blanka's cosmetics is quite small
and<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.210> instead

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and what you're going to do is instead

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
and what you're going to do is instead
of<00:01:27.630> smiling<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.530> works<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.189> most<00:01:29.340> people

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
of smiling which works for most people

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.249 
of smiling which works for most people
who<00:01:29.759> smile<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.240> apply<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.869> blend<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
who smile you apply it here you blend it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.210 
who smile you apply it here you blend it
you're<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> slightly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you're going to do it slightly

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're going to do it slightly
differently<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.420> smile

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
differently you're not going to smile

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
differently you're not going to smile
you're<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> duck<00:01:34.650> face<00:01:34.860> right

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you're going to do the duck face right

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
you're going to do the duck face right
so<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> bring<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.329> cheek<00:01:36.600> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so you're going to bring your cheek so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
so you're going to bring your cheek so
your<00:01:37.170> lips<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.799> roll<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.970> cheeks

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
your lips like this roll out your cheeks

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
your lips like this roll out your cheeks
go<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:40.110> bit<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.799> then

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
go a little bit more like this and then

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.080 
go a little bit more like this and then
you're<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> follow<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you're going to follow that kind of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.679 
you're going to follow that kind of
horizontal<00:01:42.390> line<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
horizontal line but you go from here and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
horizontal line but you go from here and
another<00:01:45.960> trick<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.130> come<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.790> too

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
another trick is not to come in too

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.389 
another trick is not to come in too
close<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> nose<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> tend<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> do

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
close to the nose so what I tend to do

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.789 
close to the nose so what I tend to do
is<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:51.000> where<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.390> eye<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
is to go off where your eye is so if you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.139 
is to go off where your eye is so if you
just<00:01:52.950> follow<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.460> eye<00:01:53.490> when<00:01:53.850> you're<00:01:53.939> looking

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just follow your eye when you're looking

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
just follow your eye when you're looking
straight<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> mirror<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.979> okay<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
straight on in a mirror here is okay to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
straight on in a mirror here is okay to
apply<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.060> don't<00:01:57.299> apply<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.540> too<00:01:57.780> close

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
apply it but don't apply it too close

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
apply it but don't apply it too close
and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.070> apply<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
and you can just apply here and then

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
and you can just apply here and then
you're<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> blend<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> upwards<00:02:01.439> because

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you're going to blend it upwards because

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
you're going to blend it upwards because
what<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.219> want<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> create<00:02:03.180> more

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
what we want to do is to create more

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.630 
what we want to do is to create more
lift<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.320> face<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.829> give<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
lift to the face and give it more of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640 
lift to the face and give it more of
like<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> slender

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
like a slender

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.200 
like a slender
so<00:02:07.890> instead<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.400> like<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.880> we'll<00:02:09.180> just

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
so instead of going like this we'll just

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.480 
so instead of going like this we'll just
add<00:02:09.540> more<00:02:10.050> width<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.680> broaden<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> face

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
add more width and broaden the face

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.920 
add more width and broaden the face
we're<00:02:11.880> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> apply<00:02:12.240> it<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
we're going to apply it like this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.690 
we're going to apply it like this
so<00:02:13.050> we'll<00:02:13.230> lift<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> face<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.550> going

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so we'll lift the face so you're going

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700 
so we'll lift the face so you're going
to<00:02:14.730> load<00:02:14.940> up<00:02:15.090> your<00:02:15.120> brush<00:02:15.270> you're<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.290> do
