00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.100
 It was all 10 points 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 I found myself in a place that there is a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 hobby to the horse that I did not know was 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.110

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.390

 good enough to tell you that for us 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 It is proud to have to have Martin 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 here in colombia but let's see who 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.409
 in martín 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.430
 I'm not from Ameghino, a town in the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.240
 province of buenos aires mochi with 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.460
 10,000 inhabitants 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.060
 and well I grew up there and he said 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.820
 and less 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.540
 can say some peculiarity less 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.680
 is that is the first polo club 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.420
 which it was founded in Argentina that is 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.230
 We were surrounded by many young 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.840
 polo horses 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.110
 that was founded as a place where there was 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.400
 many english 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.400
 the crescent of the club 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.490
 well probably that's why there were many 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.399
 horse breeding around 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.149
 good to have at hand was always 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.149
 how to ride a bicycle 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:16.130
 good and martín martínez a child created 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:20.570
 in the field around the horses to 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.410
 you start to feel that proximity 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.930
 to the horse that wanting to be in his world 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.330
 because I think that part of the magic of 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.110
 Taming the horse is knowing how to live your world 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.620
 Martin and starts to be really 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.920
 started from very young I would tell you that I see 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 photos were not even remember 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030
 little horse 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.280
 I started to 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.940
 and they have practically put me on top of 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.900
 horse 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.819
 and good and it was after I was growing and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.710
 Really 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.750
 it was very 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.600
 common has a horse where I was 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.850
 I do not remember well when but but 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.830
 He came to make your means of transport 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.319
 that is, I'm going to school, I'm going to visit 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.750
 the friends of the place 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.240
 no no no no because it was a town 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.390
 but let's say they had the parquet of some 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.000
 appetite 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.670
 and from there they went out to walk and they are not ones and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.980
 I did not need it because I was there 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 clear but 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.950
 then a little bit bigger I started 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.550
 make some polo horses 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.670
 that were close on a farm and nearby 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.459
 of the people that attracted you to the horse 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.980
 as an animal what was the sensation that 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.890
 you saw suddenly the kings tell him the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.660
 can be the tool they felt 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.150
 Kingfisher around a horse 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.250
 I really liked all the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.280
 animals 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.340
 I mean, I always had different types 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.740
 of animals and had good relationship with 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.100
 all animals 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:18.730
 then I start 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.549
 also when the dog sets 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.520
 also always with horses 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.940
 and then I start to leave more to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.620
 the side of the horse that is with the animal 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.050
 that you can do many things 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.830
 share many things well 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 consciously not by one as a boy not 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.580
 it does not analyze much 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.379
 and well surely I had felt 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.479
 very good with horses because they do not 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.189
 I had no friend to accompany me 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.220
 brother my father 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:57.150
 I always went alone 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:01.970
 and well it started like this I started to form my 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.970
 herd my breeding 12 years 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.810
 I started doing my first horses 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.540
 pole at 14 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.520
 I always went alone to a fifth of 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.800
 ezeiza since they are 5 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.500
 I've spent all my life with horses 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.370
 I had always had that tendency that 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.370
 no one instilled it 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.210
 and could have done something else we can 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.480
 say that it is a natural tendency 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:34.470
 you came to the middle you found the magic 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.530
 of that world and the rapport with with 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.660
 this animal remains has been I believe that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.650
 fundamental part in the development of 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.650
 man and humanity
