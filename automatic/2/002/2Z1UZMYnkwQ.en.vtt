00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 I ask you so and ben at the same 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.340
 time I take this opportunity for you to me 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.579
 ask a little question from elsewhere on 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.810
 this subject I saw that so the first 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.189
 running object I had found you have 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.200
 quite a lot so there I found a 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.400
 second and so I tell myself that I 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.319
 also discover a lot of stuff these 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.840
 recent times like this I'm 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.190
 asked if it would interest you 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.129
 I do not know I'm lying a little series 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.750
 games finds a cute funny object 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.060
 which finally sews anything in this 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.739
 type there but if you have that you 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 would interest that white make a video 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.540
 of presentation as I do 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.609
 currently 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.370
 and I'll let you know 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.000
 little question I hope you there 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.769
 answer and that would make me happy and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.510
 I'll have a little idea for them 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.010
 next videos 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 here you are, then the wines defined you 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.590
 can see from you prepare for the CEO 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.109
 you can buy so the famous 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.549
 tonic for a pea 28 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.450
 I admit to dress like a little 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.859
 little expensive especially if you go in 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.540
 take a lot but hey you go 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.650
 see the result 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.239
 that's still worth it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.239
 see justify a small cross wins 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.120
 all cute everything was great 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.470
 good owl the only concern is that 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 like other tonic you do not have 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.849
 of fighting mode let's say it's a 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
 little damage of the blow prepare so we 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.340
 could see did a coalition of 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.040
 of what guen it was great so 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.010
 here I hope that this kit objects you 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.430
