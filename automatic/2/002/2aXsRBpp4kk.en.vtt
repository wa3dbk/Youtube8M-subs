00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the drill and cannot be endl upward if

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.799 
the drill and cannot be endl upward if
it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> loaded<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:41.940> via<00:00:42.180> drill<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it was loaded off via drill would I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
it was loaded off via drill would I
never<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> uh<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.270> uh<00:00:45.270> spin<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> now

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
never be able to uh to uh spin so now

going to preserve the mud for a longer

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.179 
going to preserve the mud for a longer
so<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.289> to<00:01:19.380> fit<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.829> in<00:01:20.039> your

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so it's going to fit down in your

so it's going to fit down in your
basement<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> stay<00:01:22.110> wet<00:01:22.439> or

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
basement it's going to stay wet or

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.529 
basement it's going to stay wet or
longer<00:01:23.039> because<00:01:23.399> you<00:01:23.549> add<00:01:23.700> some<00:01:24.179> some<00:01:24.420> hot

longer because you add some some hot

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.399 
longer because you add some some hot
water<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:24.899> it<00:01:26.179> because<00:01:27.179> again<00:01:27.539> one<00:01:27.929> when<00:01:28.289> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
water to it because again one when you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249 
water to it because again one when you
pick<00:01:29.039> it<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.280> come<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> store<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.539> it's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
pick it up come on the store it is it's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.819 
pick it up come on the store it is it's
a<00:01:31.469> lacy<00:01:31.799> pick<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.259> workable

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a lacy pick and it's it's not workable

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
a lacy pick and it's it's not workable
and<00:01:35.640> though<00:01:35.819> the<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.450> alarm<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.929> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and though the off the alarm that it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.429 
and though the off the alarm that it
just<00:01:37.380> sits<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.399> P<00:01:38.969> up<00:01:39.090> via<00:01:39.329> via<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
just sits there P up via via more that

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.469 
just sits there P up via via more that
the<00:01:40.560> air<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.280> pull<00:01:41.520> out<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.060> water

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
the air is going to pull out the water

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.449 
the air is going to pull out the water
so<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> falling<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.189> from

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
so as you can see it falling from from

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.339 
so as you can see it falling from from
all<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> drill<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.750> again<00:01:48.989> it<00:01:49.110> has<00:01:49.319> the

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
all the drill and again it has the

00:01:49.349 --> 00:02:09.310 
all the drill and again it has the
inconsistency<00:01:49.739> of<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.459> a<00:01:50.489> pancake<00:01:50.929> batter

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.950 

some<00:02:10.320> people<00:02:10.710> add<00:02:10.950> dish<00:02:11.910> soap<00:02:12.210> too<00:02:12.600> much<00:02:12.780> to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
some people add dish soap too much to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.580 
some people add dish soap too much to
other<00:02:13.110> mud<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.740> never<00:02:14.280> done<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
other mud I never done it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.790 
other mud I never done it
yeah<00:02:16.590> saying<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> helps<00:02:18.170> eliminate<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
yeah saying that it helps eliminate the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:41.550 
yeah saying that it helps eliminate the
bubbles<00:02:20.610> cause<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.930> it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.619 

and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.489> best<00:02:43.879> thing<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> do<00:02:44.359> without

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
and then the best thing to do without

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.899 
and then the best thing to do without
your<00:02:44.930> drill<00:02:45.230> bit<00:02:45.439> is<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.859> transfer<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.670> into

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
your drill bit is to transfer it into

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.619 
your drill bit is to transfer it into
another<00:02:47.390> empty<00:02:48.280> five<00:02:49.280> five-gallon<00:02:50.239> bucket

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
another empty five five-gallon bucket

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.259 
another empty five five-gallon bucket
filled<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.049> with<00:02:51.260> hot<00:02:51.500> water<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:52.849> just

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
filled up with hot water and then just

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.830 
filled up with hot water and then just
simply<00:02:53.599> spin<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.260> out<00:02:55.299> once<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.450> dries<00:02:56.810> on

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
simply spin it out once it dries on

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.710 
simply spin it out once it dries on
there<00:02:57.319> then<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:58.209> break<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.390> off<00:02:59.450> with

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
there then you have to break it off with

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.240 
there then you have to break it off with
a<00:02:59.870> hammer<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:03.379> just<00:03:03.739> let<00:03:03.889> that<00:03:04.040> sit<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:06.250> then

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
a hammer so just let that sit and then

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.059 
a hammer so just let that sit and then
so<00:03:08.120> now<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:08.870> believe<00:03:09.170> me<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.379> have<00:03:09.680> two<00:03:09.889> of<00:03:10.010> them

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
so now we believe me I have two of them

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.009 
so now we believe me I have two of them
here<00:03:10.129> so<00:03:10.280> we're<00:03:10.609> going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.760> put<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.180> up<00:03:11.299> top<00:03:11.810> on

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
here so we're going to put the up top on

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.300 
here so we're going to put the up top on
one<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.379> you<00:03:12.470> always<00:03:12.739> want<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.950> make<00:03:13.040> sure

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
one and you always want to make sure

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.360 
one and you always want to make sure
that<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:13.700> take<00:03:13.939> your<00:03:14.000> four-inch<00:03:14.750> blade<00:03:14.900> here

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that you take your four-inch blade here

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.390 
that you take your four-inch blade here
scrape<00:03:16.370> down<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.439> inside<00:03:18.439> of<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.829> because

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
scrape down the inside of it because

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.699 
scrape down the inside of it because
this<00:03:19.819> will<00:03:20.120> dry<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.019> you'll<00:03:21.169> get<00:03:21.290> chunks

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
this will dry and then you'll get chunks

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.849 
this will dry and then you'll get chunks
in<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:21.980> your<00:03:22.129> mud<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:22.519> uh<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:24.500> don't<00:03:24.680> want

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
in on your mud so uh so we don't want

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.470 
in on your mud so uh so we don't want
that<00:03:24.919> so<00:03:25.069> what<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.519> do<00:03:25.669> is<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.909> scrape<00:03:26.299> it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
that so what you do is you scrape it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.539 
that so what you do is you scrape it
down<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:29.230> before<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:30.769> seal<00:03:31.159> it<00:03:31.189> it's

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
down and then before you I seal it it's

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.319 
down and then before you I seal it it's
it's<00:03:31.970> always<00:03:32.480> best<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.220> take<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> sponge<00:03:34.760> with<00:03:35.299> a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
it's always best to take a sponge with a

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.349 
it's always best to take a sponge with a
cold<00:03:35.870> water<00:03:36.200> not<00:03:36.530> hot<00:03:36.590> water<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:38.090> and

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
cold water not hot water and just and

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.689 
cold water not hot water and just and
sponge<00:03:38.780> down<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.620> idea<00:03:40.010> inside<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:41.419> alum

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
sponge down the idea inside that alum

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.490 
sponge down the idea inside that alum
that<00:03:43.699> old<00:03:43.909> no.12<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.690> will<00:03:44.870> get<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.139> surface

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
that old no.12 that will get the surface

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.009 
that old no.12 that will get the surface
of<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.769> bucket<00:03:46.040> totally<00:03:46.760> clean<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.389> just

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
of the bucket totally clean and just

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.379 
of the bucket totally clean and just
leave<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> film<00:03:48.979> about<00:03:49.129> water<00:03:49.579> on<00:03:49.699> the<00:03:50.000> top<00:03:50.209> of

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
leave a a film about water on the top of

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.240 
leave a a film about water on the top of
it<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.750> water<00:03:50.989> will<00:03:51.319> preserve<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.889> mud<00:03:52.069> and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
it that water will preserve the mud and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.879 
it that water will preserve the mud and
when<00:03:53.030> it's<00:03:53.299> time<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.780> break<00:03:54.199> up<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.530> let<00:03:54.650> again

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
when it's time to break up and let again

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.309 
when it's time to break up and let again
you<00:03:55.069> just<00:03:55.250> simply<00:03:55.639> pour<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.540> water<00:03:56.750> out<00:03:57.079> and

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
you just simply pour the water out and

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.239 
you just simply pour the water out and
then<00:03:57.440> simply<00:03:58.250> mix<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.760> back<00:03:58.879> up<00:03:59.120> again
