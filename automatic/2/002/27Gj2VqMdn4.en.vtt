power adapter I don't know if the
batteries<00:00:22.690> work<00:00:22.900> I<00:00:23.080> would<00:00:23.230> assume<00:00:24.000> you'd<00:00:25.000> have

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
batteries work I would assume you'd have

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.430 
batteries work I would assume you'd have
to<00:00:25.270> clean<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.630> contacts

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
to clean the contacts

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.310 
to clean the contacts
it's<00:00:26.680> got<00:00:28.770> dust<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.070> grime<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:31.060> if<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.140> get

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
it's got dust and grime and if you get

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's got dust and grime and if you get
real<00:00:32.589> close<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.940> some<00:00:34.210> paint<00:00:34.449> splatters

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
real close there's some paint splatters

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.899 
real close there's some paint splatters
so<00:00:35.289> if<00:00:35.859> you<00:00:36.039> want<00:00:36.219> it<00:00:36.339> mint<00:00:36.550> you're<00:00:36.730> going<00:00:36.850> to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:36.909

you

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.730 

I'm<00:01:10.509> gonna<00:01:10.689> crank<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.670> very

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I'm gonna crank it up here that very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.359 
I'm gonna crank it up here that very
slight<00:01:17.789> hum<00:01:19.469> so<00:01:20.469> when<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.679> crank<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.130> up<00:01:21.219> you

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
slight hum so when you crank it up you

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.120 
slight hum so when you crank it up you
can<00:01:21.520> hear<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> very<00:01:22.000> slight<00:01:22.390> hum<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:24.100> know

can hear a very slight hum you know
maybe<00:01:24.429> there's<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.729> resistor<00:01:25.299> or<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.659> transistor

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
maybe there's a resistor or a transistor

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.399 
maybe there's a resistor or a transistor
or<00:01:26.649> something<00:01:27.100> that's<00:01:27.869> leaking<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:29.140> little

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
or something that's leaking a little

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.679 
or something that's leaking a little
voltage<00:01:29.619> or<00:01:30.039> whatever<00:01:30.340> but<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.299> have<00:01:31.509> to

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
voltage or whatever but you have to

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.580 
voltage or whatever but you have to
crank<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.289> really<00:01:32.740> hear<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:37.590> doesn't

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
crank it to really hear it doesn't
