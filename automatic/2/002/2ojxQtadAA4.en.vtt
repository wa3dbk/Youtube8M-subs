00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it's still super soft and I have used a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's still super soft and I have used a
lot<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.560> heat<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.570> here<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.330> it's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
lot of heat on this here a lot and it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.449 
lot of heat on this here a lot and it's
really<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:09.660> nice<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.890> say<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
really really nice I will say that the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.809 
really really nice I will say that the
first<00:02:11.730> couple<00:02:12.000> time

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
first couple time

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.459 
first couple time
well<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> first<00:02:13.390> two<00:02:13.659> times<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.200> curl

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
well the first two times that you curl

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.099 
well the first two times that you curl
it<00:02:14.579> make<00:02:15.579> sure<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.969> use<00:02:16.329> that<00:02:16.360> hairspray

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
it make sure you use that hairspray

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.020 
it make sure you use that hairspray
because<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.709> curls<00:02:18.010> are<00:02:18.189> not<00:02:18.489> gonna<00:02:18.730> last

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
because the curls are not gonna last

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.920 
because the curls are not gonna last
because<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.170> hair<00:02:20.409> is<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.480> silky<00:02:22.480> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
because the hair is just so silky and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.539 
because the hair is just so silky and
like<00:02:23.170> longer<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.250> little<00:02:24.400> bit

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
like longer here it's like a little bit

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.360 
like longer here it's like a little bit
heavy<00:02:24.879> because<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.599> much<00:02:26.079> grabs<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.739> so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
heavy because of how much grabs it is so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.470 
heavy because of how much grabs it is so
you<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:27.489> really<00:02:27.760> need<00:02:27.969> to<00:02:28.000> lock<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.359> in<00:02:28.450> with

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
you just really need to lock it in with

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.110 
you just really need to lock it in with
that<00:02:28.689> hairspray<00:02:29.159> other<00:02:30.159> than<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.760> think

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that hairspray other than that I think

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.170 
that hairspray other than that I think
it<00:02:31.390> blends<00:02:31.720> really<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:32.500> nicely<00:02:33.180> but

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
it blends really really nicely but

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.380 
it blends really really nicely but
they're<00:02:34.540> super<00:02:35.170> super<00:02:35.409> long<00:02:35.769> super<00:02:36.489> thick<00:02:36.909> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390

it was just 22 inches because that's a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.339 
lot of hair for some people like this
but<00:04:50.520> like<00:04:50.699> even<00:04:51.029> for<00:04:51.270> me<00:04:51.449> like<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.139> lot<00:04:52.259> of

but like even for me like it's a lot of

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.689 
but like even for me like it's a lot of
hair<00:04:52.499> for<00:04:52.680> me<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.919> my<00:04:52.979> hair<00:04:53.159> is<00:04:53.189> kind<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.550> like

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
hair for me and my hair is kind of like

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.290 
hair for me and my hair is kind of like
it's<00:04:54.689> been<00:04:54.840> growing<00:04:55.110> out<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.759> this<00:04:56.759> set<00:04:57.180> was

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
it's been growing out and this set was

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.469 
it's been growing out and this set was
about<00:04:57.539> 210<00:04:58.439> dollars<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.919> believe<00:04:59.279> and<00:04:59.909> again<00:05:00.240> I

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
about 210 dollars I believe and again I

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.480 
about 210 dollars I believe and again I
think<00:05:00.779> that's<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:00.990> pretty<00:05:01.770> good<00:05:01.889> price<00:05:02.159> point

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
think that's a pretty good price point

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.830 
think that's a pretty good price point
for<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.759> quality<00:05:02.789> of<00:05:03.240> extensions<00:05:03.719> that

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
for the quality of extensions that

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.309 
for the quality of extensions that
you're<00:05:04.020> getting<00:05:04.349> if<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.620> get<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.719> 160<00:05:06.719> grams

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
you're getting if you get the 160 grams

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.540 
you're getting if you get the 160 grams
I<00:05:07.430> believe<00:05:08.430> it's<00:05:08.699> significantly<00:05:09.479> less<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:11.400> if

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
I believe it's significantly less and if

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.189 
I believe it's significantly less and if
you<00:05:11.699> get<00:05:11.849> the<00:05:12.029> one<00:05:12.210> there's<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.810> little<00:05:13.020> Eagle

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199

really<00:05:41.339> nice<00:05:41.759> and<00:05:42.500> what<00:05:43.500> else<00:05:43.649> did<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.860> want<00:05:43.889> to
