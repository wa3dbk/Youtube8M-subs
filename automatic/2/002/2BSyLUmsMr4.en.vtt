00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
was the sleeping on service so if these

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.000 
was the sleeping on service so if these
two<00:00:17.340> guys<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.820> go<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> bed<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:19.050> will<00:00:19.199> see<00:00:19.470> that

of<00:00:20.250> course<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.730> won't<00:00:20.910> change<00:00:21.300> today<00:00:21.779> now

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
of course it won't change today now

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.849

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
because I'm stood up and that is a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
because I'm stood up and that is a
problem<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.430> servers<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.000> sometimes

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
problem on servers because sometimes

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990 
problem on servers because sometimes
there's<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.320> afk<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> short<00:00:29.730> amount<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
there's one afk for a short amount of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.060 
there's one afk for a short amount of
time<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.210> even<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> longer<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.500> then

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
time or even for a longer time and then

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.680 
time or even for a longer time and then
the<00:00:32.340> others<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.880> able<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> change<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the others are not able to change it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130 
the others are not able to change it
today<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.290> stop<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> rain<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.040> sleeping<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.140> I

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
today or stop the rain by sleeping and I

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.090 
today or stop the rain by sleeping and I
think<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.950> big<00:00:38.070> issue<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
think that that's a big issue and the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
think that that's a big issue and the
system<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.250> sleeping<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:42.090> should<00:00:42.480> be

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
system how sleeping what should be

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.010 
system how sleeping what should be
changed<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> thought<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.750> might

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
changed and I thought well it it might

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
changed and I thought well it it might
be<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.890> 50%<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> people<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
be good if just 50% of the people on the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.350 
be good if just 50% of the people on the
server<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> bed<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> means<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.149> two

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
server are in a bed so that means if two

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.029 
server are in a bed so that means if two
people<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> server<00:00:52.079> dress<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.559> needs<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
people on the server dress one needs to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
people on the server dress one needs to
sleep<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.489> three<00:00:54.329> people<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> server<00:00:55.460> two

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sleep if three people on the server two

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.970 
sleep if three people on the server two
needs<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> sleep<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.809> four<00:00:58.590> people<00:00:58.890> on

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
needs to need to sleep if four people on

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
needs to need to sleep if four people on
the<00:00:59.010> server<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.760> need<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> sleep<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.719> five

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the server to need to sleep if five

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.689 
the server to need to sleep if five
people<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> server<00:01:01.739> three<00:01:02.219> need<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> sleep

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
people on a server three need to sleep

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.960 
people on a server three need to sleep
and<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.690> there<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.040> 50%<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.489> more<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and so on so there are 50% or more in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
and so on so there are 50% or more in
the<00:01:06.090> bed<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> day<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> system

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the bed to make it day and the system

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
the bed to make it day and the system
that<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.080> came<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.310> right

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that I came up with you can see right

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
that I came up with you can see right
here<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.619> need<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.040> us<00:01:14.220> it's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
here that's all you need for us it's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
here that's all you need for us it's
just<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.090> command<00:01:15.420> blocks<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:16.140> o'clock<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
just for command blocks one o'clock so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
just for command blocks one o'clock so
not<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> lot<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.400> updates<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.030> happening<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
not a lot of updates are happening and a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
not a lot of updates are happening and a
bit<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> logic<00:01:19.560> behind<00:01:20.040> us<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.570> will

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bit of logic behind us and I will

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
bit of logic behind us and I will
quickly<00:01:22.020> explain<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> logic<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
quickly explain to you the logic in just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.850 
quickly explain to you the logic in just
a<00:01:24.030> moment<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.600> let<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.869> activate<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.530> first

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a moment but let me activate this first

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
a moment but let me activate this first
so<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.570> works<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.049> takes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so you can see that this works it takes

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
so you can see that this works it takes
a<00:01:28.409> moment<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a moment and that's because we want to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.170 
a moment and that's because we want to
still<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.020> sleeping<00:01:31.970> animation<00:01:32.970> time

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
still have the sleeping animation time

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580 
still have the sleeping animation time
where<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.420> gets<00:01:33.630> stuck<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> hop<00:01:34.350> into

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
where it gets stuck when you hop into

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.749 
where it gets stuck when you hop into
your<00:01:34.619> bed<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.970> course<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
your bed and of course we want to you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
your bed and of course we want to you
make<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> normal<00:01:40.259> sleeping<00:01:42.200> yeah

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

have the preference so if I alone on the
serve<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> bed<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> bed<00:01:48.990> should

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
serve and go to bed it the bed should

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
serve and go to bed it the bed should
strange<00:01:49.590> today<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> redstone

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
strange today and not so the redstone

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.380 
strange today and not so the redstone
that<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.509> set<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.759> yeah<00:01:53.759> how<00:01:53.970> does<00:01:54.210> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that we set up so yeah how does this

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.230 
that we set up so yeah how does this
work<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> clock<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.240> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
work we have this clock here and this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
work we have this clock here and this
flux<00:01:57.450> activating<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.259> command<00:01:58.619> blocks<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
flux activating to command blocks the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.370 
flux activating to command blocks the
first<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.750> checking<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
first one here is just checking for

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
first one here is just checking for
place<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> ovoid<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.969> test<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.869> at

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
place in the ovoid so it's test for at

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
place in the ovoid so it's test for at
all<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> radius<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.610> block<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.000> we

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
all with the radius of one block so we

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.719 
all with the radius of one block so we
are<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.390> testing<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> overworld<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
are just testing in the overworld and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
are just testing in the overworld and
this<00:02:08.729> signal<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.989> goes<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:10.649> through

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this signal then just goes right through

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.900 
this signal then just goes right through
into<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.520> repeater<00:02:12.060> there

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
into this repeater there

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.360 
into this repeater there
so<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.660> gives<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.170> signal<00:02:14.530> strength<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.100> three

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so this gives a signal strength of three

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.980 
so this gives a signal strength of three
right<00:02:15.550> now<00:02:15.730> because<00:02:15.910> we're<00:02:16.270> three<00:02:16.510> people<00:02:16.870> on

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
right now because we're three people on

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.970 
right now because we're three people on
the<00:02:17.080> server<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.510> over<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:19.960> we've<00:02:20.680> got

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
the server and then over here we've got

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.980 
the server and then over here we've got
the<00:02:21.430> same<00:02:21.910> thing<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.510> command<00:02:22.900> block

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
the same thing in this command block

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.670 
the same thing in this command block
test<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> tall<00:02:24.310> R<00:02:24.850> M<00:02:25.210> equals<00:02:25.630> one<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.410> it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
test for a tall R M equals one but it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.200 
test for a tall R M equals one but it
got<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.160> NVT<00:02:27.880> tag<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.450> sleeping<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.230> true<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.280> I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
got the NVT tag a sleeping is true and I

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.930 
got the NVT tag a sleeping is true and I
guess<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.930> should<00:02:31.960> just<00:02:32.200> show<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.790> by

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
guess I should just show this to you by

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.580 
guess I should just show this to you by
adding<00:02:34.240> two<00:02:34.360> redstone<00:02:34.780> dust<00:02:34.930> here<00:02:35.110> set<00:02:35.470> it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
adding two redstone dust here set it

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.580 
adding two redstone dust here set it
tonight<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.510> one<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.750> guys<00:02:37.900> can<00:02:38.140> go<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> bed

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
tonight so one of the guys can go to bed

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.260 
tonight so one of the guys can go to bed
I<00:02:38.620> guess<00:02:38.890> Rica<00:02:39.280> will<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.210> can

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
I guess Rica will do it and now you can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.850 
I guess Rica will do it and now you can
see<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.840> redstone<00:02:41.170> turns<00:02:41.440> on<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> nifty

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
see that this redstone turns on a nifty

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.270 
see that this redstone turns on a nifty
knee<00:02:42.190> annouce<00:02:42.670> goes<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.210> bed<00:02:43.390> too<00:02:43.950> he<00:02:44.950> will<00:02:45.100> see

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
knee annouce goes to bed too he will see

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.960 
knee annouce goes to bed too he will see
that<00:02:45.490> this<00:02:46.210> redstone<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:46.690> turns<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.380> -<00:02:48.010> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
that this redstone here turns on - so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.520 
that this redstone here turns on - so
we've<00:02:49.120> got<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.360> certain<00:02:49.750> strength<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:50.110> -<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.440> we

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
we've got a certain strength of - so we

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.110 
we've got a certain strength of - so we
can<00:02:50.680> detect<00:02:51.010> how<00:02:51.250> many<00:02:51.430> people<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> server

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
can detect how many people on the server

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.480 
can detect how many people on the server
and<00:02:52.270> how<00:02:52.420> many<00:02:52.600> people<00:02:52.780> are<00:02:52.990> sleeping<00:02:53.310> then<00:02:54.310> we

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
and how many people are sleeping then we

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.100 
and how many people are sleeping then we
are<00:02:54.580> doing<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.910> little<00:02:55.090> bit<00:02:55.240> of<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.420> calculation

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
are doing a little bit of a calculation

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.840 
are doing a little bit of a calculation
here<00:02:56.320> we're<00:02:56.710> taking<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.220> sickness<00:02:57.610> strength

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
here we're taking this sickness strength

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.000 
here we're taking this sickness strength
twice<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.730> retracting<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.880> from<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:02.350> signal

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
twice and retracting it from the signal

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.590 
twice and retracting it from the signal
strength<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.730> people<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.150> are<00:03:04.210> on<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
strength of the people that are on the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.740 
strength of the people that are on the
server<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:06.130> there<00:03:06.970> are<00:03:07.090> three<00:03:07.360> people<00:03:07.390> on

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
server so if there are three people on

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.590 
server so if there are three people on
the<00:03:07.840> server<00:03:08.050> like<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.240> in<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
the server like now and one is in the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.260 
the server like now and one is in the
bed<00:03:10.810> then<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:11.950> are<00:03:12.070> doing<00:03:13.200> yeah<00:03:14.230> 3<00:03:14.620> -<00:03:15.280> 2<00:03:15.520> times<00:03:15.940> 1

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
bed then we are doing yeah 3 - 2 times 1

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.560 
bed then we are doing yeah 3 - 2 times 1
which<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:17.110> 1<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.220> will<00:03:18.430> stays<00:03:18.700> lit<00:03:19.030> but<00:03:19.420> if

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
which is 1 so this will stays lit but if

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.300 
which is 1 so this will stays lit but if
two<00:03:19.720> people<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> server<00:03:20.530> we<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:20.890> doing<00:03:21.220> is

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
two people on the server we are doing is

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.780 
two people on the server we are doing is
free<00:03:21.610> -<00:03:22.480> 2<00:03:23.050> times<00:03:23.350> 2<00:03:23.620> which<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:23.920> 4<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:24.490> we<00:03:24.610> would

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
free - 2 times 2 which is 4 so we would

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.290 
free - 2 times 2 which is 4 so we would
have<00:03:24.940> minus<00:03:25.420> 1<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.770> that's<00:03:27.400> equal<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.060> 0

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
have minus 1 so this that's equal to 0

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.610 
have minus 1 so this that's equal to 0
for<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.660> because<00:03:28.840> we<00:03:29.020> don't<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.470> negative

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
for this because we don't have negative

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.750 
for this because we don't have negative
numbers<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:31.480> turns<00:03:31.780> off<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.550> same<00:03:33.550> goes

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
numbers and this turns off and same goes

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.550 
numbers and this turns off and same goes
then<00:03:34.000> for<00:03:34.390> big<00:03:34.660> amounts<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.110> people<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.500> for

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
then for big amounts of people so for

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.340 
then for big amounts of people so for
example<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:36.160> 6<00:03:36.400> people<00:03:36.730> if<00:03:37.090> 3<00:03:37.930> people<00:03:37.960> are

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
example for 6 people if 3 people are

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.980 
example for 6 people if 3 people are
sleeping<00:03:38.530> we<00:03:38.920> are<00:03:39.010> doing<00:03:39.220> 6<00:03:39.670> -<00:03:40.180> 2<00:03:40.420> times<00:03:40.690> 3

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
sleeping we are doing 6 - 2 times 3

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.699 
sleeping we are doing 6 - 2 times 3
which<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.290> 0<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:43.270> then<00:03:43.660> goes<00:03:44.350> into<00:03:44.500> this

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
which is 0 this then goes into this

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.730 
which is 0 this then goes into this
repeater<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:46.120> keeps<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.290> redstone<00:03:47.709> here

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
repeater which keeps the redstone here

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.190 
repeater which keeps the redstone here
lit<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.550> is<00:03:48.700> just<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.090> fade-out<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:51.010> we

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
lit and this is just a fade-out so if we

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.620 
lit and this is just a fade-out so if we
take<00:03:53.200> away<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:53.980> repeater<00:03:54.700> here<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.390> see

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
take away this repeater here you see

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.260 
take away this repeater here you see
that<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.990> goes<00:03:56.320> darker<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.970> signal

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
that this goes darker and the signal

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.550 
that this goes darker and the signal
strengths<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.750> circuit<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.260> stressed

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
strengths in the circuit is stressed

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.230 
strengths in the circuit is stressed
decreasing<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.840> guess<00:04:01.840> it's<00:04:02.020> for<00:04:02.940> ticks<00:04:03.940> it

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
decreasing I guess it's for ticks it

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.590 
decreasing I guess it's for ticks it
takes<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.890> decrease<00:04:05.890> by<00:04:06.220> 1<00:04:06.970> sickness<00:04:07.360> rings

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
takes to decrease by 1 sickness rings

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.770 
takes to decrease by 1 sickness rings
and<00:04:08.400> that's<00:04:09.400> just<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:10.060> give<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.660> of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and that's just to give it a bit of

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.210 
and that's just to give it a bit of
delay<00:04:11.020> for<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.860> sleeping<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:13.680> then<00:04:14.680> by<00:04:15.160> this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
delay for the sleeping and then by this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.810 
delay for the sleeping and then by this
we<00:04:15.910> turn<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.020> torch<00:04:17.350> off<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.040> if<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.549> goes

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
we turn the torch off and if this goes

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.270 
we turn the torch off and if this goes
off<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.480> after<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> few<00:04:20.020> seconds<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.770> our

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
off so after a few seconds that our

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.130 
off so after a few seconds that our
torch<00:04:21.669> turns<00:04:21.940> on<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.300> just<00:04:22.479> activates<00:04:22.930> these

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
torch turns on and just activates these

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.910 
torch turns on and just activates these
2<00:04:23.440> command<00:04:23.770> blocks<00:04:24.010> which<00:04:24.640> are<00:04:24.880> time<00:04:25.450> sets<00:04:25.840> day

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
2 command blocks which are time sets day

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.890 
2 command blocks which are time sets day
and<00:04:27.040> whether<00:04:27.550> clear<00:04:28.030> because<00:04:28.270> that's<00:04:28.660> what's

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and whether clear because that's what's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.930 
and whether clear because that's what's
happening<00:04:29.320> when<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.950> change<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.400> today<00:04:30.640> was

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
happening when you change it today was

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.470 
happening when you change it today was
the<00:04:31.150> bet<00:04:31.300> so<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.530> guess<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.490> that's<00:04:33.730> all<00:04:34.420> you

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
the bet so I guess that that's all you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.520 
the bet so I guess that that's all you
need

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
need

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.100 
need
yeah<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.400> will<00:04:36.610> just<00:04:36.850> go<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.660> mode<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:37.930> you

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
yeah I will just go to this mode so you

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.260 
yeah I will just go to this mode so you
can<00:04:38.350> copy<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.740> redstone<00:04:39.130> make<00:04:39.610> sure<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
can copy the redstone make sure that the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.250 
can copy the redstone make sure that the
two<00:04:40.450> comparators<00:04:41.400> right<00:04:42.400> here<00:04:42.670> are<00:04:42.910> in

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
two comparators right here are in

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.990 
two comparators right here are in
subtract<00:04:44.260> mode<00:04:44.470> so<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.800> subtract<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.670> signal

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
subtract mode so you subtract the signal

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.310 
subtract mode so you subtract the signal
strengths<00:04:46.330> here<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.470> not<00:04:47.680> compare<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.430> and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
strengths here and not compare it and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.540 
strengths here and not compare it and
then<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.500> command<00:04:50.830> blocks<00:04:51.040> are<00:04:51.190> all<00:04:51.250> ready<00:04:51.430> so

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
then the command blocks are all ready so

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.420 
then the command blocks are all ready so
let<00:04:51.730> me<00:04:51.820> show<00:04:51.970> them<00:04:52.150> again<00:04:52.390> first<00:04:53.140> one<00:04:53.430> second

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
let me show them again first one second

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.990 
let me show them again first one second
one<00:04:54.460> third<00:04:55.020> one<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:57.040> last<00:04:57.160> one<00:04:57.370> and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
one third one and the last one and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.810 
one third one and the last one and
that's<00:04:58.510> all<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:58.810> need<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.380> change<00:04:59.830> the<00:05:00.160> sleepy

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
that's all you need to change the sleepy

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.120 
that's all you need to change the sleepy
