00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 you do not feel admiration of mexico here 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.810
 do not 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.550
 all where this place is called 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.920
 exactly the same 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.310
 mariachi garibaldi is one of the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.780
 city 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.060
 here I see a lot of mariachi more here 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.160
 for example the friend as he is doing well 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.140
 he still does not bother him that he does not 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.660
 for nothing you should not become famous 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.080
 some way you always come by 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 here 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.080
 if they always come every night or 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.080
 How is it 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 if there is a custom and that comes with 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.140
 the whole band 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.530
 you arm yourself what instrument you play 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 for example trumpeter ok and more or less 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.989
 how much is the cost of the song a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.989
 song 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.179
 105 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.579
 depends on the elements and depends on the 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.440
 face that they ask for it or also if they see a 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.649
 face that well gringa like mine can 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.939
 take out 1200 safe insurance 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.250
 good good friends I'll see if in 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.490
 I get the increase in a song 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.649
 until now 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 around here now if it 's here it will be a 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.229
 party seems to me that it looks like it was put together 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.480
 the party does not hear asking the guide the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.740
 people 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.070

 and friends now 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.460
 song for example seeing my face like this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.670

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.380
