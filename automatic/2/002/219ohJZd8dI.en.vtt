at 93 overall it's kind of skirting

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.380 
at 93 overall it's kind of skirting
around<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.840> rage<00:00:38.770> issue<00:00:39.100> we're<00:00:39.820> really<00:00:40.030> proud

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
around the rage issue we're really proud

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.150 
around the rage issue we're really proud
that<00:00:40.449> we<00:00:40.840> actually<00:00:40.989> have<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.470> running<00:00:41.800> at<00:00:42.129> a

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
that we actually have it running at a

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.100 
that we actually have it running at a
really<00:00:42.460> good<00:00:42.670> frame<00:00:42.940> rate<00:00:43.180> on<00:00:43.390> all<00:00:43.809> four

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
really good frame rate on all four

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.670 
really good frame rate on all four
platforms<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:45.010> that's<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.309> mac<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:46.180> pc<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
couple of things with the texturing hero

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.229 
couple of things with the texturing hero
on<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.070> pc<00:00:54.489> version<00:00:54.519> that<00:00:54.970> can<00:00:55.059> break

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
on the on the pc version that can break

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.969 
on the on the pc version that can break
in<00:00:55.479> and<00:00:55.930> again<00:00:56.140> this<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.409> all<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.799> is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
in and again this is all this is

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.160 
in and again this is all this is
actually<00:00:57.370> one<00:00:57.580> of<00:00:57.610> our<00:00:57.850> our<00:00:58.180> environments

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
actually one of our our environments

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.710 
actually one of our our environments
from<00:00:59.739> rage<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.239> not<00:01:01.390> like<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> typical

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
from rage so it's not like a typical

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.299 
from rage so it's not like a typical
tech<00:01:02.290> demo<00:01:02.620> where<00:01:02.769> we<00:01:02.860> just<00:01:03.040> showing<00:01:03.250> you

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
tech demo where we just showing you

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.090 
tech demo where we just showing you
something<00:01:03.610> cool<00:01:03.909> I<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.690> actually<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.979> know

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
something cool I can actually you know

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.969 
something cool I can actually you know
get<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.430> here<00:01:06.930> should<00:01:07.930> switch<00:01:08.440> it<00:01:08.560> from<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.830> AI

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
get in here should switch it from the AI

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.850 
get in here should switch it from the AI
take<00:01:09.820> over<00:01:10.240> start<00:01:10.900> driving<00:01:11.440> knock<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.799> guy

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
take over start driving knock that guy

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.250 
take over start driving knock that guy
around<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:14.530> any<00:01:14.680> time<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.979> can<00:01:15.220> actually

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
around and at any time I can actually

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.130 
around and at any time I can actually
switch<00:01:17.260> back<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.770> let<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.070> AI<00:01:18.400> take<00:01:19.140> control

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
switch back and let the AI take control

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010 
switch back and let the AI take control
here<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.640> go<00:01:21.760> back<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.210> looping<00:01:22.570> camera

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
here I can go back to the looping camera

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.330 
here I can go back to the looping camera
but<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:23.290> not<00:01:23.470> just<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:24.010> video<00:01:24.790> or<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.420> demo<00:01:25.869> here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
but it's not just a video or a demo here

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.910 
but it's not just a video or a demo here
if<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.490> switch<00:01:27.760> around<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.600> couple<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.530> different

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
if I switch around a couple of different

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.280 
if I switch around a couple of different
views<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.850> for<00:01:34.030> instance<00:01:34.150> two<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.870> our<00:01:34.960> goals

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
views this for instance two of our goals

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.460 
views this for instance two of our goals
when<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.250> know<00:01:36.370> Tim<00:01:36.580> Wilson<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.350> other

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
when you know Tim Wilson and the other

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.990 
when you know Tim Wilson and the other
designers<00:01:39.010> were<00:01:39.160> talking<00:01:39.490> about<00:01:39.550> what<00:01:39.850> we

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
designers were talking about what we

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600 
designers were talking about what we
wanted<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.300> accomplish<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.890> always<00:01:42.370> done

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
wanted to accomplish it's always done

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.910 
wanted to accomplish it's always done
the<00:01:43.060> indoor<00:01:43.360> environments<00:01:43.870> really<00:01:44.140> well<00:01:44.350> we

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
the indoor environments really well we

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.860 
the indoor environments really well we
like<00:01:45.130> doing<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.940> level<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.420> detail<00:01:46.480> that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
like doing that level of detail that

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.900 
like doing that level of detail that
you've<00:01:47.200> seen<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.530> our<00:01:47.650> games<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.760> big

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
you've seen in our games and it's a big

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.000 
you've seen in our games and it's a big
deal<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.180> us<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.720> we're<00:01:50.380> going<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.530> maintain

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
deal to us and we're going to maintain

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.310 
deal to us and we're going to maintain
that<00:01:51.480> but<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.570> reason<00:01:52.720> we<00:01:52.930> chose<00:01:52.960> this

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
that but the reason we chose this

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.480 
that but the reason we chose this
environment<00:01:53.860> it's<00:01:53.950> going<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.159> something<00:01:54.430> a

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
environment it's going to something a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.760 
environment it's going to something a
little<00:01:54.640> different<00:01:54.940> but<00:01:55.900> we<00:01:56.110> still<00:01:56.350> managed<00:01:56.740> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
little different but we still managed to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.490 
little different but we still managed to
get<00:01:57.040> this<00:01:57.250> kind<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.670> large-scale<00:01:58.570> detail<00:01:59.350> you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
get this kind of large-scale detail you

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500 
get this kind of large-scale detail you
see<00:01:59.680> here<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.040> giant<00:02:00.460> cliff<00:02:00.730> faces<00:02:01.030> and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
see here with giant cliff faces and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.140 
see here with giant cliff faces and
boulders<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.640> know<00:02:03.730> you<00:02:03.820> don't<00:02:03.970> see<00:02:04.120> a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
boulders and you know you don't see a

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.940 
boulders and you know you don't see a
lot<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.390> procedural<00:02:05.229> stuff<00:02:05.530> although<00:02:05.830> we

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
lot of procedural stuff although we

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.309 
lot of procedural stuff although we
could<00:02:06.159> use<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.580> if<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.909> made<00:02:07.090> sense<00:02:07.360> but<00:02:08.140> you

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
could use that if it made sense but you

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.619 
could use that if it made sense but you
can<00:02:08.440> go<00:02:08.590> from<00:02:08.890> these<00:02:09.340> giant<00:02:09.789> boulders<00:02:10.209> all<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
can go from these giant boulders all the

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.160 
can go from these giant boulders all the
way<00:02:10.750> down<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:12.159> pebble<00:02:12.519> level<00:02:12.790> basically

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
way down to a pebble level basically

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.890 
way down to a pebble level basically
it's<00:02:14.170> really<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:15.099> gives<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> arm<00:02:15.610> artist

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it's really it gives the arm artist

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.240 
it's really it gives the arm artist
you<00:02:16.959> know<00:02:17.049> enough<00:02:17.290> freedom<00:02:17.590> where<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.099> won't

vehicles<00:04:08.330> this<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.570> actually<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> i<00:04:09.080> driving

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
vehicles this is actually a i driving

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.920 
vehicles this is actually a i driving
around<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.100> track<00:04:10.370> they<00:04:11.360> do<00:04:11.420> their<00:04:11.720> thing

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
around this track they do their thing

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.580 
around this track they do their thing
pretty<00:04:12.140> well<00:04:16.300> ok<00:04:17.300> now<00:04:17.480> here<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> am<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.170> again

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
pretty well ok now here I am and again

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.990 
pretty well ok now here I am and again
I'm<00:04:18.680> hopping<00:04:19.070> around<00:04:19.160> here<00:04:19.550> for<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.820> sake<00:04:19.970> of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
I'm hopping around here for the sake of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.790 
I'm hopping around here for the sake of
the<00:04:20.180> demo<00:04:20.450> but<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.960> player<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.350> just<00:04:21.560> drive<00:04:21.739> a

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
the demo but the player can just drive a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.490 
the demo but the player can just drive a
car<00:04:22.130> get<00:04:22.520> out<00:04:22.670> anywhere<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.450> explore<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
car get out anywhere and explore the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.620 
car get out anywhere and explore the
world<00:04:24.740> basically<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.640> that's<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.540> think

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
world basically and that's the I think

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.030 
world basically and that's the I think
that's<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.020> biggest<00:04:27.260> thing<00:04:27.440> that's<00:04:27.770> driving

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
that's the biggest thing that's driving

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.120 
that's the biggest thing that's driving
us<00:04:28.460> right<00:04:28.700> now<00:04:28.730> is<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:30.380> just<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.650> ability

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
us right now is it's just that ability

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.860 
us right now is it's just that ability
to<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.820> vehicle<00:04:32.300> kind<00:04:32.480> of<00:04:32.570> be<00:04:32.690> your

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
to have the vehicle kind of be your

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.470 
to have the vehicle kind of be your
avatar<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.650> then<00:04:34.280> you're<00:04:34.880> able<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.210> drive

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
avatar and then you're able to drive

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.300 
avatar and then you're able to drive
anywhere<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.290> something<00:04:36.620> off<00:04:36.740> at<00:04:36.890> a<00:04:36.950> distance

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
anywhere see something off at a distance

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.180 
anywhere see something off at a distance
it<00:04:37.460> looks<00:04:37.640> kind<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.970> cool<00:04:38.150> drive<00:04:38.990> up<00:04:39.290> get<00:04:40.070> out

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
it looks kind of cool drive up get out

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.460 
it looks kind of cool drive up get out
the<00:04:40.370> car<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.910> then<00:04:41.060> walk<00:04:41.300> around<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:41.930> still

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
the car and then walk around and still

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.920 
the car and then walk around and still
have<00:04:42.680> these<00:04:42.890> kind<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.310> extremely<00:04:44.150> detailed<00:04:44.720> in

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
have these kind of extremely detailed in

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.680 
have these kind of extremely detailed in
your<00:04:45.110> environments<00:04:46.180> decided<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.300> throw<00:04:47.450> them

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
your environments decided to throw them

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.440 
your environments decided to throw them
then<00:04:47.870> there's<00:04:48.110> beer<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.490> see<00:04:49.790> if<00:04:49.880> i<00:04:50.060> zoom

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
then there's beer if you see if i zoom

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.840 
then there's beer if you see if i zoom
in<00:04:50.810> really<00:04:50.960> close<00:04:51.080> here<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.800> see<00:04:51.980> it's

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
in really close here you can see it's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.100 
in really close here you can see it's
what<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.180> would<00:04:53.270> expect<00:04:53.540> out<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.780> anything

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
what you would expect out of anything

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.960 
what you would expect out of anything
all<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.710> detail<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.310> we<00:04:55.430> would<00:04:55.610> normally

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
all the detail that we would normally

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.490 
all the detail that we would normally
have<00:04:56.120> with<00:04:56.270> our<00:04:56.420> characters<00:04:56.960> we're<00:04:57.380> not

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
have with our characters we're not

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.200 
have with our characters we're not
getting<00:04:57.770> rid<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.250> we're<00:04:58.430> not<00:04:58.550> we're<00:04:59.180> not

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
getting rid of that we're not we're not

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.630 
getting rid of that we're not we're not
totally<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.050> know<00:05:00.200> departing<00:05:01.100> from<00:05:01.220> what<00:05:01.430> we

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
totally you know departing from what we

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.790 
totally you know departing from what we
normally<00:05:01.790> do<00:05:02.240> we're<00:05:02.630> just<00:05:02.780> adding<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.290> top<00:05:03.530> a

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
normally do we're just adding on top a

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.190 
normally do we're just adding on top a
lot<00:05:04.190> of<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.580> lot<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.820> different<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.840> know<00:05:05.960> cool

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
lot of a lot of different you know cool

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.950 
lot of a lot of different you know cool
elements<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:08.030> one<00:05:08.210> thing<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.540> game<00:05:08.780> will

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
elements the one thing this game will

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.510 
elements the one thing this game will
never<00:05:09.170> do<00:05:09.380> is<00:05:09.560> get<00:05:09.710> stale<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.370> guarantee<00:05:11.030> that

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.749 

so<00:05:15.090> again<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.449> I<00:05:15.539> was<00:05:15.660> mentioning<00:05:15.810> before

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
so again like I was mentioning before

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.040 
so again like I was mentioning before
it's<00:05:17.759> really<00:05:18.000> not<00:05:18.120> very<00:05:18.180> good<00:05:18.569> having<00:05:18.960> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
it's really not very good having the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.369 
it's really not very good having the
ability<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:19.500> completely<00:05:20.930> uniquely<00:05:21.930> texture

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
ability to completely uniquely texture

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.040 
ability to completely uniquely texture
an<00:05:22.500> entire<00:05:22.830> world<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.669> again<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.210> at<00:05:24.750> this

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
an entire world and again this at this

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.189 
an entire world and again this at this
track<00:05:25.289> actually<00:05:25.710> uses<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.129> 64<00:05:26.729> x<00:05:26.930> 64<00:05:27.930> k

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
track actually uses a 64 x 64 k

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.950 
track actually uses a 64 x 64 k
landscape<00:05:28.710> texture<00:05:29.099> but<00:05:29.789> some<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.360> our<00:05:30.479> waste

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
landscape texture but some of our waste

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.279 
landscape texture but some of our waste
lands<00:05:31.440> are<00:05:31.590> actually<00:05:32.240> 128<00:05:33.240> x<00:05:33.449> 28<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.139> that's

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
lands are actually 128 x 28 so that's

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.950 
lands are actually 128 x 28 so that's
like<00:05:34.620> four<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.159> these<00:05:35.509> you<00:05:36.509> know<00:05:36.599> combined

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
like four of these you know combined

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.379 
like four of these you know combined
together<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.460> actual<00:05:38.729> physical

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
together and the actual physical

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.390 
together and the actual physical
distance<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.259> you<00:05:40.379> get<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.560> travel<00:05:41.099> with<00:05:41.250> all

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
distance that you get to travel with all

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.490 
distance that you get to travel with all
the<00:05:41.550> roads<00:05:41.789> and<00:05:42.150> walking<00:05:42.840> up<00:05:42.990> tiny<00:05:43.229> little

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
the roads and walking up tiny little

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.610 
the roads and walking up tiny little
paths<00:05:43.830> it's<00:05:44.539> it's<00:05:45.539> actually<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.960> challenge<00:05:46.229> for

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
paths it's it's actually a challenge for

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.439 
paths it's it's actually a challenge for
us<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:47.009> take<00:05:47.159> advantage<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:47.880> much<00:05:48.150> space

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
us to take advantage of that much space

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.420 
us to take advantage of that much space
to<00:05:48.509> have<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.080> gameplay<00:05:49.500> but<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.830> it's<00:05:49.979> it's

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
to have the gameplay but it it's it's

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.730 
to have the gameplay but it it's it's
turning<00:05:50.789> out<00:05:50.849> for<00:05:51.060> you<00:05:51.120> all<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:51.479> far<00:05:51.720> so<00:05:52.560> again

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
turning out for you all so far so again

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.100 
turning out for you all so far so again
you<00:05:53.340> know<00:05:53.430> having<00:05:54.060> ability<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.599> do<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:54.930> one

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
you know having ability to do it is one

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.450 
you know having ability to do it is one
thing<00:05:55.380> but<00:05:55.620> having<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.919> tools<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.340> take

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
thing but having the tools to take

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.120 
thing but having the tools to take
advantage<00:05:57.330> of<00:05:57.630> it<00:05:57.690> there's<00:05:58.199> another<00:05:58.500> thing<00:05:58.800> so
