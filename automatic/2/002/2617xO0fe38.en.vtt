00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.300

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.950
 not yet seen the cubes that's in 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:36.030

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 the more it is not bad it looks a little 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.720
 to a shengchu three faults a leap after 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.690

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.810
 that there will be enough here what they 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.810
 make 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 the super is now a little gadget 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.360
 of 2 x 3 x 3 where the friction co2 is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:56.160
 so we will open it 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 that's fine then what is it 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.760
 crazy because I believe that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.050
 it was but today we saw the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.660
 parcel if I also ordered 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.750
 so here I have never touched any 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.880
 like that or so let's go to go 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.130
 super is not great but it flows 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:23.250
 in for sale you can not turn when 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:30.660
 it's too long good here I feel that a 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.010
 brilliant even three games too happy 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.440
 we may make regions of heaven 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.550
 if it's not super important but it has 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.810
 all lived another good vintage collection 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.440
