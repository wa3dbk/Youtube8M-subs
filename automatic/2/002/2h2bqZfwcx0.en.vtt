00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.180 
eventually possibly in the feature later
but<00:05:01.510> it's<00:05:02.510> not<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> minute<00:05:03.020> i<00:05:03.200> also<00:05:03.800> have<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.040> deck

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
but it's not a minute i also have a deck

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.770 
but it's not a minute i also have a deck
i<00:05:04.280> call<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.610> weapon<00:05:04.850> harvest<00:05:05.240> which<00:05:05.390> sucks

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
i call the weapon harvest which sucks

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.880 
i call the weapon harvest which sucks
really<00:05:06.440> really<00:05:06.830> bad<00:05:07.040> it's<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.090> combo<00:05:08.390> deck<00:05:08.570> but

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
really really bad it's a combo deck but

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.780 
really really bad it's a combo deck but
there's<00:05:09.890> no<00:05:09.980> guarantee<00:05:10.040> that<00:05:10.340> we'll<00:05:10.550> get<00:05:10.640> the

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
there's no guarantee that we'll get the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.930 
there's no guarantee that we'll get the
cards<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.300> combo<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:12.320> I'm<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.640> sort<00:05:13.880> of

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
cards in the combo and I'm it sort of

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.230 
cards in the combo and I'm it sort of
breaks<00:05:14.290> my<00:05:15.290> philosophy<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.130> where<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:17.140> card<00:05:19.240> in

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
breaks my philosophy of where a card in

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.150 
breaks my philosophy of where a card in
a<00:05:20.360> combo<00:05:20.780> isn't<00:05:21.200> good<00:05:21.350> unless<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:22.010> can

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
a combo isn't good unless you can

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.540 
a combo isn't good unless you can
actually<00:05:22.610> do<00:05:23.090> something<00:05:23.360> on<00:05:23.810> its<00:05:24.080> own<00:05:24.200> and

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
actually do something on its own and

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.220 
actually do something on its own and
that's<00:05:25.550> what<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:25.880> sucks<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:26.930> will<00:05:27.110> work

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
that's what that sucks and I will work

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.380 
that's what that sucks and I will work
on<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:28.340> deck<00:05:28.550> has<00:05:28.700> an<00:05:28.820> interesting<00:05:29.210> idea

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
on that the deck has an interesting idea

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.360 
on that the deck has an interesting idea
basically<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:30.170> create<00:05:30.530> a<00:05:30.560> lot<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.830> tokens<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.250> lot

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
basically I create a lot of tokens a lot

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.850 
basically I create a lot of tokens a lot
of<00:05:31.460> creature<00:05:31.670> tokens<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:33.320> sort<00:05:33.740> of

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
of creature tokens and I sort of

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.400 
of creature tokens and I sort of
sacrifice<00:05:34.340> them<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:34.760> various<00:05:35.030> purposes<00:05:35.410> kind

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
sacrifice them for various purposes kind

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.490 
sacrifice them for various purposes kind
of<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> pilot<00:05:37.160> debt<00:05:37.810> except<00:05:38.810> instead<00:05:39.380> of

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
of like a pilot debt except instead of

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.460 
of like a pilot debt except instead of
using<00:05:39.770> salads<00:05:40.280> I<00:05:40.750> really<00:05:41.750> try<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:41.990> use<00:05:42.170> cars

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
using salads I really try to use cars

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.990 
using salads I really try to use cars

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
but it's a cool idea and I'm going to

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.720 
but it's a cool idea and I'm going to
see<00:06:51.140> if<00:06:51.170> I<00:06:51.290> can<00:06:51.440> make<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.560> work<00:06:51.910> so<00:06:52.910> I<00:06:52.970> will<00:06:53.470> I'm

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730

see if I can make it work so I will I'm
so<00:06:57.460> that's<00:06:58.460> basically<00:06:58.670> we<00:06:59.090> just<00:06:59.120> so<00:06:59.420> talking

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
so that's basically we just so talking

about magic cards I have different index
I'm<00:07:03.530> working<00:07:04.130> on<00:07:04.720> I<00:07:05.720> just<00:07:06.260> thought<00:07:06.350> it<00:07:06.470> was<00:07:06.590> a

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
I'm working on I just thought it was a

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.090 
I'm working on I just thought it was a
cool<00:07:06.800> idea<00:07:06.860> because<00:07:07.490> I<00:07:07.580> haven't<00:07:07.730> seen<00:07:08.030> many

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100
