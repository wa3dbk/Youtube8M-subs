00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
scene and that is going to make a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:08.550 
scene and that is going to make a
magical<00:02:54.590> black-and-white<00:02:55.250> shot

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560

another<00:03:27.120> thing<00:03:27.390> about<00:03:27.420> when<00:03:27.810> you're<00:03:27.840> shooting

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
another thing about when you're shooting

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.589 
another thing about when you're shooting

all<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.829> way<00:03:38.010> through<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> exposure<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.209> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
all the way through the exposure and it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.260 
all the way through the exposure and it
