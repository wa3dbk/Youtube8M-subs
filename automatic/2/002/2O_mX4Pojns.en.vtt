00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hurting the Knicks are hurting and their

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
hurting the Knicks are hurting and their
fans<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.100> hurting<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> next<00:01:15.119> fans<00:01:15.299> have

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
fans are hurting but the next fans have

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.030

been<00:01:15.600> hurting<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:16.290> 40<00:01:16.650> years<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.979> i

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
been hurting for about 40 years so i

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.140 
been hurting for about 40 years so i
guess<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.700> doesn't<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
guess that really doesn't make a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
guess that really doesn't make a
difference<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
difference at this point in time and it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.380 
difference at this point in time and it
came<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.520> dude<00:01:20.759> would<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> willing

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
came out that this dude would be willing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
came out that this dude would be willing
to<00:01:21.659> waive<00:01:21.900> his<00:01:22.170> no-trade<00:01:22.409> clause<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.369> there's
