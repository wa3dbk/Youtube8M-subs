00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
using that product I noticed that it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.820 
using that product I noticed that it
gave<00:00:20.760> me<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.090> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> discoloration<00:00:21.830> and

gave me some kind of discoloration and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.490

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
then I asked some people because I was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
then I asked some people because I was
um<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:25.949> reasoning<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.550> Galactica<00:00:27.090> oxy

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
um I was reasoning with Galactica oxy

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.660 
um I was reasoning with Galactica oxy
pills<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> thought<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> lactic<00:00:28.980> acid

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670

pair<00:00:29.849> those<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.779> maybe<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.099> well<00:00:32.340> with

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
pair those was maybe not going well with
