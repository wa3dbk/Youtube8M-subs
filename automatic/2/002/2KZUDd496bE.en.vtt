00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
stuck with doubles in the beginning and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
stuck with doubles in the beginning and
they<00:00:48.660> switched<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> singles<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.620> weights<00:00:49.860> got

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.959 
they switched to singles as weights got
heavier<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:52.160> couple<00:00:53.160> times<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.610> got<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
heavier and a couple times they got a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.130 
heavier and a couple times they got a
situation<00:00:54.570> where<00:00:54.690> they're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
situation where they're going a little

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.420 
situation where they're going a little
too<00:00:55.230> heavy<00:00:55.530> moving<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> weights<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> little

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
too heavy moving the weights a little

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
too heavy moving the weights a little
bit<00:00:56.520> too<00:00:56.670> slow<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.289> an

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
bit too slow but they don't get an

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
bit too slow but they don't get an
opportunity<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.920> train<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> often

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
opportunity to train with me that often

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
opportunity to train with me that often
so<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.809> were<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.079> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so they were just kind of going for it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
so they were just kind of going for it
you<00:01:02.399> also<00:01:02.579> notice<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.680> Camilo<00:01:04.680> goes<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you also notice that Camilo goes for a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.719 
you also notice that Camilo goes for a
high<00:01:05.820> rep<00:01:06.060> set<00:01:06.470> where<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:07.590> lowers<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> weights

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
down a little bit and he ends up doing

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
down a little bit and he ends up doing
like<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> set<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> 10<00:01:11.580> reps<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.320> it
