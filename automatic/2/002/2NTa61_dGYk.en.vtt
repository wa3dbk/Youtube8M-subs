all the other planet waves gear that

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.390 
all the other planet waves gear that
I've<00:00:14.700> owned<00:00:15.030> over<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> many<00:00:15.450> years<00:00:15.839> it's

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
I've owned over the many years it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.830 
I've owned over the many years it's
exactly<00:00:17.400> like<00:00:17.609> everything<00:00:18.150> else<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.600> just

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
exactly like everything else like just

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960 
exactly like everything else like just
great<00:00:19.140> quality<00:00:19.619> very<00:00:20.279> high<00:00:20.340> level<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
great quality very high level of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.790 
great quality very high level of
construction<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.900> detail<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> biggest

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
construction and detail it's the biggest

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
construction and detail it's the biggest
thing<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> course<00:00:23.189> about<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.939> cable<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
thing of course about this cable that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.900 
thing of course about this cable that
separates<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.320> cable<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.460> packet<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
separates this cable from the packet is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
separates this cable from the packet is
the<00:00:27.029> reason<00:00:27.300> why<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> picked<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.960> myself<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.800> few

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
the reason why I picked up myself a few

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
the reason why I picked up myself a few
of<00:00:29.070> these<00:00:29.220> cables<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> huge<00:00:31.320> tip

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
of these cables it's just that huge tip

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.110 
of these cables it's just that huge tip
and<00:00:31.920> we'll<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.160> some<00:00:32.340> close-ups<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and we'll have some close-ups for you to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
and we'll have some close-ups for you to
check<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:34.110> if<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
check out now if we have a look at this

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
check out now if we have a look at this
tip<00:00:35.010> compared<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.700> other<00:00:35.910> cables<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tip compared to some other cables that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
tip compared to some other cables that
I've<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:36.719> laying<00:00:36.899> around<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.920> can

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
I've got laying around you can

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
I've got laying around you can
definitely<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.059> cable<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> lot

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
definitely see that this cable is a lot

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.959 
definitely see that this cable is a lot
higher<00:00:40.379> quality<00:00:40.410> connection<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> end<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
higher quality connection at the end and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
higher quality connection at the end and
not<00:00:42.480> only<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> thicker<00:00:43.649> tip<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
not only that but it's a thicker tip and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
not only that but it's a thicker tip and
what<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> thicket<00:00:45.030> tip<00:00:45.239> means<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
what that thicket tip means is on the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
what that thicket tip means is on the
inside<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.700> input<00:00:48.239> jack<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:49.050> guitar

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
inside of your input jack of your guitar

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
inside of your input jack of your guitar
and<00:00:49.680> here's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> guitar<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.360> go

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and here's a guitar now when we go

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.840 
and here's a guitar now when we go
inside<00:00:51.719> those<00:00:52.260> teeth<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:53.100> they<00:00:53.219> lock<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
inside those teeth when they lock in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.200 
inside those teeth when they lock in
because<00:00:54.690> having<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> thicker<00:00:55.500> secure<00:00:56.219> top

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
because having that thicker secure top

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.580 
because having that thicker secure top
at<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> end<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> mean<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
at the end it's going to mean that it's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.470 
at the end it's going to mean that it's
a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.250> secure<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.390> going

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
a little bit more secure it's just going

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
a little bit more secure it's just going
to<00:01:00.570> feel<00:01:00.870> nice<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.289> tight<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> snug<00:01:02.100> when<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to feel nice and tight and snug when you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.189 
to feel nice and tight and snug when you
do<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
do put it in there it's not going to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
do put it in there it's not going to
accidentally<00:01:04.650> fly<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
accidentally fly out it's not going to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
accidentally fly out it's not going to
drop<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.290> locked<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
drop out because it's just locked in and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
drop out because it's just locked in and
purely<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
purely all it is is because it's a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
purely all it is is because it's a
thicker<00:01:10.680> tip<00:01:11.010> we've<00:01:11.280> got<00:01:11.430> another<00:01:11.729> guitar

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
thicker tip we've got another guitar

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
thicker tip we've got another guitar
again<00:01:12.860> different<00:01:13.860> connection<00:01:14.250> different

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
again different connection different

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.200 
again different connection different
guitar<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.450> same<00:01:15.720> sound<00:01:16.610> same<00:01:17.610> feel<00:01:17.939> that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
guitar but same sound same feel that's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
guitar but same sound same feel that's
locked<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.680> going

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
locked in there that's not going

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.039 
locked in there that's not going
anywhere

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
anywhere

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.190 
anywhere
so<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:23.570> again<00:01:24.570> we've<00:01:24.689> got<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> different

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so good again we've got a different

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
so good again we've got a different
guitar<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> same<00:01:26.340> thing<00:01:26.729> from

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
guitar but it's the same thing from

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.800 
guitar but it's the same thing from
listen<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> connection<00:01:29.299> such<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> strong

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
listen to the connection such a strong

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
listen to the connection such a strong
and<00:01:31.079> secure<00:01:31.530> connection<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.790> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and secure connection that's that's not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
and secure connection that's that's not
going<00:01:33.270> anywhere<00:01:33.450> that's<00:01:33.990> stuck<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
going anywhere that's stuck in there and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
going anywhere that's stuck in there and
really<00:01:35.310> guys<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.880> having<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.270> thicker<00:01:36.930> end

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really guys just having this thicker end

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.230 
really guys just having this thicker end
is<00:01:37.530> slightly<00:01:37.799> rounded<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.520> thicker<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
is slightly rounded and thicker in so it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
is slightly rounded and thicker in so it
fits<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.110> jacks<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> little<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:40.920> better

with this this new connection everything

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500 
with this this new connection everything
just<00:04:49.320> feels<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:49.770> tight<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.370> secure<00:04:50.850> so<00:04:51.480> I
