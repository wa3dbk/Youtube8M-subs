I was trying to reach plateau point by

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
I was trying to reach plateau point by
Sunrise<00:01:03.199> okay<00:01:04.199> well<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> meant<00:01:04.769> getting<00:01:04.920> up

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
Sunrise okay well that meant getting up

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.010 
Sunrise okay well that meant getting up
at<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:05.909> forty-five<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> morning<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
at two forty-five in the morning and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
at two forty-five in the morning and
hoofing<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.490> six<00:01:08.939> miles<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
hoofing it about six miles down into the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.950 
hoofing it about six miles down into the
canyon<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.590> ready<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.100> sunrise<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
canyon to be ready for sunrise and I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
canyon to be ready for sunrise and I
guess<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> miscalculated<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.400> quickly

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
guess that I miscalculated how quickly

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.160 
guess that I miscalculated how quickly
i'd<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.180> able<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
i'd be able to get down there in the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
i'd be able to get down there in the
dark<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:17.100> still<00:01:17.430> had<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> mile<00:01:17.909> or<00:01:18.119> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
dark because i still had a mile or so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.450 
dark because i still had a mile or so
left<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> started<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> sky
