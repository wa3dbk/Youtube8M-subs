00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.230
 have breakfast and you know the little pancito 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.750

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.210
 house or does not move away totally typical and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.160
 classic a recipe super fast biker and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.720
 with strawberry jam like that is to see me the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.369
 deference of leaving preparing very well 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.930
 lady ready then we started with the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.779
 preparation in this mansion and it's 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.570
 put to the fire we put the water that is 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.189
 500 milliliters sugar 500 milliliters and 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.590
 the strawberries that is a kilo always the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.120
 fault is going to double the amount this in 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 all of you are going to move and move 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.800
 constantly to fire well low and 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.140
 Use a thick bottom pot to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.710
 prevent it from going to burn they are going to 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.620
 move move and move 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.170
 about 12 to 15 minutes 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.850
 I'm using the whole fruit for 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.970
 that when it evaporates already 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.760
 let's have the fruit still look 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.250
 here I already have the advanced marmalade 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.700
 which I will simply add 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.550
 lemon droplets 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.470
 to give them the rich flavor and that went down 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.100
 a little bit the strong sweet that has the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.720
 jam and a little bit of glucose that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.660
 it will give you shine 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.600
 then the lemon at the end already with the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.040
 pot off but still hot 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.530
 and bubbly and glucose we move and 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.540
 this is ready if we are going to do 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.400
 front do not forget that they are whole 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.650
 so that the fruit feels and looks 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.930
 as what I already have on the table 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.340
