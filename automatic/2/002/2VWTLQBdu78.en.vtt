00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and we're here to see the garden boiler

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.440 
and we're here to see the garden boiler
that<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.020> helped<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.770> fund<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.270> Taos

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that we helped to fund for the Taos

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.440 
that we helped to fund for the Taos

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
Pueblo and to have it fired up and to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.400 
Pueblo and to have it fired up and to
see<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> works<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.670> long<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.410> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
see how it works so how long is the the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.250 
see how it works so how long is the the
statement<00:00:43.800> involved<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.340> project<00:00:44.550> we

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
statement involved in this project we

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.960 
statement involved in this project we
funded<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.380> out<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.770> some<00:00:47.250> capital<00:00:47.610> outlay

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
funded it out of some capital outlay

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.940 
funded it out of some capital outlay
funding<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.630> received<00:00:49.050> clean<00:00:49.590> energy

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
funding that we received clean energy

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
funding that we received clean energy
program<00:00:50.160> funding<00:00:50.760> mm-hm<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:51.360> that's<00:00:51.690> been<00:00:52.080> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
program funding mm-hm and that's been I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180 
program funding mm-hm and that's been I
would<00:00:52.920> say<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.250> least<00:00:53.280> two<00:00:53.790> years<00:00:54.000> ago<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.190> we

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
would say at least two years ago and we

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.980 
would say at least two years ago and we
were<00:00:56.220> very<00:00:56.490> excited<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.330> got<00:00:57.480> completed

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
were very excited that it got completed

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.450 
were very excited that it got completed
and<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.950> are<00:00:59.340> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.330> see<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.460> project

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and that we are going to see a project

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
and that we are going to see a project
of<00:01:02.580> ours<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.420> running<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.900> that<00:01:04.049> we're

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
of ours up and running and that we're

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.620 
of ours up and running and that we're
going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.949> being<00:01:05.189> successful<00:01:05.909> that's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
going to see it being successful that's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.260 
going to see it being successful that's
why<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:07.049> here

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.240 

we<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:11.960> going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.350> be<00:01:12.469> firing<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:13.070> our

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
we are going to be firing up our

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.060 
we are going to be firing up our
district<00:01:13.700> heating<00:01:13.880> system<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.070> basically

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
district heating system and basically

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.279 
district heating system and basically
it's<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.369> biomass<00:01:16.880> heating<00:01:17.210> system<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.140> will

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
it's a biomass heating system that will

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.800 
it's a biomass heating system that will
support<00:01:18.710> our<00:01:18.979> educational<00:01:19.969> facility<00:01:20.630> and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
support our educational facility and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.800 
support our educational facility and
also<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:22.179> items<00:01:23.179> that<00:01:23.390> are<00:01:23.509> going<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.689> be

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
also the items that are going to be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.359 
also the items that are going to be
growing<00:01:24.079> in<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.289> greenhouse<00:01:24.649> in<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
growing in the greenhouse in the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.160 
growing in the greenhouse in the
greenhouses<00:01:25.759> which<00:01:26.119> is<00:01:26.299> monumental<00:01:27.020> because

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
greenhouses which is monumental because

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.889 
greenhouses which is monumental because
the<00:01:27.950> cost<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:28.340> propane<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.789> really<00:01:29.390> high<00:01:29.569> and

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
the cost of propane is really high and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.649 
the cost of propane is really high and
so<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:31.130> we<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:31.459> defer<00:01:31.789> that<00:01:31.819> cost<00:01:32.240> any<00:01:32.539> way

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
so if we can defer that cost any way

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.059 
so if we can defer that cost any way
shape<00:01:32.840> or<00:01:33.049> form<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.500> would<00:01:33.649> be<00:01:33.799> through<00:01:34.009> a

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
shape or form it would be through a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.059 
shape or form it would be through a
system<00:01:34.429> like<00:01:34.579> this<00:01:34.959> it<00:01:35.959> was<00:01:36.140> while<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:36.500> here

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
system like this it was while I was here

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.609 
system like this it was while I was here
that<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.560> learned<00:01:39.560> about<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.189> technology<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
that I learned about this technology and

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.809 
that I learned about this technology and
saw<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.799> as<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.009> very<00:01:43.310> useful<00:01:45.280> approach<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.670> be

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
saw it as a very useful approach to be

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.969 
saw it as a very useful approach to be
taken<00:01:47.239> here<00:01:47.479> at<00:01:47.599> the<00:01:47.780> publicist<00:01:48.470> has<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.860> much

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
taken here at the publicist has so much

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.940 
taken here at the publicist has so much
wood<00:01:49.310> right<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:50.659> supply<00:01:51.140> some<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.560> their<00:01:51.649> meet

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
wood right to supply some of their meet

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.889 
wood right to supply some of their meet
some<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.189> their<00:01:52.310> energy<00:01:52.549> needs<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.569> what<00:01:53.750> was

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
some of their energy needs so what was

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.270 
some of their energy needs so what was
your<00:01:54.020> role<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.349> this<00:01:54.470> did<00:01:54.709> you<00:01:54.739> did<00:01:55.189> you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
your role in this did you did you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.419 
your role in this did you did you
install<00:01:55.429> this<00:01:55.819> well<00:01:56.689> I<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:57.229> went<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.039> got

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
install this well I I went out and got

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.850 
install this well I I went out and got
the<00:01:58.670> grant<00:01:59.000> money<00:01:59.209> for<00:01:59.989> it<00:02:00.140> through<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.590> state

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
the grant money for it through the state

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.919 
the grant money for it through the state
of<00:02:00.890> New<00:02:01.069> Mexico<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.579> wrote<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.209> grant<00:02:02.630> proposal

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
of New Mexico I wrote the grant proposal

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.959 
of New Mexico I wrote the grant proposal
and<00:02:03.619> researched<00:02:04.489> the<00:02:04.849> technology<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.700> six

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
and researched the technology and so six

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.860 
and researched the technology and so six
secured<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> funding<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.679> then

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
secured the funding for it and then

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.170 
secured the funding for it and then
manage<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.700> implementation<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
manage the implementation the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.129 
manage the implementation the
construction<00:02:16.389> actually<00:02:17.389> designed<00:02:17.930> this

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
construction actually designed this

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.970 
construction actually designed this
building<00:02:18.200> here<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> kind<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.350> coordinated

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
building here and so kind of coordinated

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.170 
building here and so kind of coordinated
the<00:02:23.590> construction<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.000> implementation<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the construction and implementation and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.160 
the construction and implementation and
then<00:02:26.359> my<00:02:26.569> grant<00:02:26.900> ran<00:02:27.139> out<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.359> so<00:02:29.359> I<00:02:29.720> was<00:02:29.989> no

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
then my grant ran out and so I was no

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.750 
then my grant ran out and so I was no
longer<00:02:30.200> working<00:02:30.859> here<00:02:31.250> when<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.639> got

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
longer working here when it got

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.809 
longer working here when it got
completed<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.470> was<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:34.130> coordination

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
completed and that was the coordination

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.599 
completed and that was the coordination
was<00:02:35.030> completed<00:02:35.569> by<00:02:35.720> ryan<00:02:36.049> rose<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:37.340> day

insulating<00:06:26.819> refractory<00:06:27.479> I<00:06:27.689> look<00:06:28.020> at<00:06:28.199> a<00:06:28.229> little

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499 
insulating refractory I look at a little

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.909 
insulating refractory I look at a little
bit<00:06:28.649> of<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:29.610> heat<00:06:30.300> from<00:06:30.959> the<00:06:31.080> flames<00:06:31.559> is

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
bit of the heat from the flames is

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.399 
bit of the heat from the flames is
bouncing<00:06:32.399> back<00:06:32.580> at<00:06:32.849> the<00:06:33.029> flame<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:33.749> in<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.199> two

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
bouncing back at the flame so in the two

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.649 
bouncing back at the flame so in the two
temperature<00:06:35.129> jumps<00:06:35.490> over<00:06:35.729> 2,000<00:06:36.330> degrees

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.869 
temperature jumps over 2,000 degrees
only<00:06:37.229> every<00:06:37.559> highest<00:06:38.009> burn<00:06:38.249> and<00:06:38.520> that's<00:06:38.699> why

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
only every highest burn and that's why

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.689 
only every highest burn and that's why
we<00:06:39.029> can<00:06:39.180> run<00:06:39.360> with<00:06:39.539> this<00:06:39.689> month<00:06:39.990> Wow<00:06:40.559> are<00:06:41.369> still
