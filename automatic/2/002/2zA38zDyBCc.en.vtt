00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.139 
you could give him but you know he's
more<00:01:54.689> likely<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.700> 22<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.820> some<00:01:57.000> women

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
more likely to go to 22 are some women

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.429 
more likely to go to 22 are some women
yeah<00:01:57.390> okay<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.469> quicker<00:01:58.710> than<00:01:58.860> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
yeah okay and just just quicker than the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
yeah okay and just just quicker than the
object<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:01.920> Liverpool<00:02:02.340> perhaps<00:02:02.939> but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
object all with Liverpool perhaps but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
object all with Liverpool perhaps but
it's<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.020> subjective<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.009> question<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it's just so subjective the question of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's just so subjective the question of
medicals<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> premier<00:02:06.810> league<00:02:06.960> clubs

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
medicals and premier league clubs

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
medicals and premier league clubs
because<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.920> NBA<00:02:08.250> where<00:02:08.580> there's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
because it's not like NBA where there's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190 
because it's not like NBA where there's
a<00:02:08.819> standard<00:02:09.270> two-day<00:02:09.599> medical<00:02:09.989> where<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
a standard two-day medical where you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
a standard two-day medical where you
have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.410> tick<00:02:10.590> certain<00:02:10.890> boxes<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.640> all

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
have to tick certain boxes it's all

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.970 
have to tick certain boxes it's all
about<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> club<00:02:12.450> decides<00:02:13.170> whether<00:02:13.770> it's

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
about when the club decides whether it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
about when the club decides whether it's
a<00:02:14.069> risk<00:02:14.280> worth<00:02:14.459> taking<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:15.090> guess<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.599> at

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
a risk worth taking I guess one at

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
a risk worth taking I guess one at
Newcastle<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:16.830> those<00:02:16.980> feathers

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
Newcastle so that all those feathers

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.240 
Newcastle so that all those feathers
Newcastle's<00:02:17.970> policy<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> fighting<00:02:18.900> fit

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
Newcastle's policy is fighting fit

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
Newcastle's policy is fighting fit
really<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> common<00:02:20.700> side<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.209> then<00:02:21.629> again<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
really in common side but then again of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.130 
really in common side but then again of
course<00:02:22.080> my<00:02:22.500> eager<00:02:22.830> failed<00:02:23.550> one<00:02:23.849> at<00:02:24.140> Newcastle

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
course my eager failed one at Newcastle

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
course my eager failed one at Newcastle
and<00:02:25.290> passed<00:02:26.069> one<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> West<00:02:26.580> Ham<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.819> aren't

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and passed one of West Ham and aren't

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
and passed one of West Ham and aren't
they<00:02:27.540> pleased<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> think<00:02:29.550> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
they pleased with that but I think you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.550 
they pleased with that but I think you
have<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.120> look<00:02:30.300> at<00:02:30.450> ready<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.780> say<00:02:30.930> he's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
have to look at ready and say he's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.809 
have to look at ready and say he's
played<00:02:31.769> an<00:02:31.860> entire<00:02:32.129> Premier<00:02:32.700> League<00:02:32.790> season

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
played an entire Premier League season

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.360 
played an entire Premier League season
he<00:02:33.269> scored<00:02:33.870> goals<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.440> he's<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.129> good<00:02:35.340> in

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
he scored goals and he's really good in

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
he scored goals and he's really good in
the<00:02:35.550> air<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:35.879> well<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.330> think<00:02:36.510> he's<00:02:36.810> just

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the air as well and I think he's just

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.040 
the air as well and I think he's just
got<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.349> ideal<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.000> profile<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.420> cover<00:02:39.629> for<00:02:39.840> G

got the ideal and profile to cover for G

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.330 
got the ideal and profile to cover for G
rue<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.349> Church<00:02:40.650> he<00:02:40.769> doesn't<00:02:41.040> make<00:02:41.129> any

rue like Church he doesn't make any

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.559 
rue like Church he doesn't make any
sense<00:02:41.489> he's<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.879> similar<00:02:42.180> sort<00:02:42.300> player

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569

in excess of 150,000 around 180 they

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.030 
in excess of 150,000 around 180 they
they<00:02:55.560> reckon<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.099> AC<00:02:57.000> milan's<00:02:57.480> pay<00:02:58.040> 86,000

they reckon and AC milan's pay 86,000

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.130 
they reckon and AC milan's pay 86,000
fair<00:02:59.849> game<00:02:59.970> which<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.300> still<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.599> ridiculous

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
fair game which is still a ridiculous

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.630 
fair game which is still a ridiculous
among<00:03:01.319> which<00:03:01.470> leaves<00:03:01.800> Chelsea<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.370> five

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
among which leaves Chelsea with five

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.449 
among which leaves Chelsea with five
million<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.959> spend<00:03:04.080> had<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.310> give

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
million to spend had they have to give

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.649 
million to spend had they have to give
my<00:03:05.610> lamb<00:03:05.730> five<00:03:05.970> millions<00:03:06.300> pays<00:03:06.510> wages

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
my lamb five millions pays wages

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.410 
my lamb five millions pays wages
basically<00:03:07.610> now<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.940> risk<00:03:09.180> worth

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
basically now is that a risk worth

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.470 
basically now is that a risk worth
taking<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:10.470> Torres<00:03:10.830> certainly<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:11.849> he

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
taking for Torres certainly because he

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.910 
taking for Torres certainly because he
needs<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.780> reinvent<00:03:13.170> himself<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.680> he's<00:03:13.769> not

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
needs to reinvent himself and he's not

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.030
