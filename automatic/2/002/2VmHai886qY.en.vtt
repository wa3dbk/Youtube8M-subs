00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
nitrile palm nitrile quite resistant to

nitrile palm nitrile quite resistant to
oils<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.109> forth<00:00:27.380> giving<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:27.679> a<00:00:27.740> good<00:00:27.919> grip

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
oils and so forth giving you a good grip

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.400 
oils and so forth giving you a good grip
now<00:00:28.849> I<00:00:28.880> say<00:00:29.119> traditionally<00:00:29.810> dip<00:00:30.050> because<00:00:30.380> a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
now I say traditionally dip because a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.170 
now I say traditionally dip because a
lot<00:00:30.650> of<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:30.859> gloves<00:00:31.400> in<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:31.699> high<00:00:31.880> flex

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
lot of the gloves in this high flex

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.660 
lot of the gloves in this high flex
series<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.840> so-called<00:00:33.079> foam<00:00:33.829> which<00:00:34.460> have

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
series of the so-called foam which have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.880 
series of the so-called foam which have
a<00:00:34.699> little<00:00:35.059> bit<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.300> air<00:00:35.750> infused<00:00:36.320> into<00:00:36.680> them

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
a little bit of air infused into them

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.010 
a little bit of air infused into them
and<00:00:37.579> this<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.879> traditional<00:00:38.270> dip<00:00:38.809> that

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
and this is a traditional dip that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.189 
and this is a traditional dip that
allows<00:00:39.289> it<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.739> be<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.219> little<00:00:40.520> bit<00:00:40.760> thinner<00:00:41.199> but

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
allows it to be a little bit thinner but

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.200 
allows it to be a little bit thinner but
all<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.590> also<00:00:42.829> a<00:00:42.890> little<00:00:43.010> bit<00:00:43.129> denser<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.030> this

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
all and also a little bit denser so this

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.849 
all and also a little bit denser so this
glove<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.539> going<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.840> be<00:00:44.960> more<00:00:45.260> abrasion

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
glove is going to be more abrasion

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.479 
glove is going to be more abrasion
resistant<00:00:46.640> across<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.180> prom<00:00:47.449> then<00:00:48.460> then<00:00:49.460> a

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
resistant across the prom then then a

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.660 
resistant across the prom then then a
foam<00:00:50.120> glove<00:00:50.660> would<00:00:50.899> be<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.920> still<00:00:52.160> has<00:00:52.370> has

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
foam glove would be it still has has

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.400 
foam glove would be it still has has
that<00:00:52.910> come<00:00:53.329> up<00:00:53.420> resistance<00:00:53.809> which<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.170> good

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
that come up resistance which is good

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.069 
that come up resistance which is good
but<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.370> different<00:00:55.730> feel<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:56.840> when<00:00:56.989> you

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
but so it's a different feel so when you

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.560 
but so it's a different feel so when you
put<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:57.350> glove<00:00:57.590> on<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:58.059> usually<00:00:59.059> wear<00:00:59.179> a<00:00:59.239> size

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
put this glove on I usually wear a size

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.439 
put this glove on I usually wear a size
8<00:01:00.190> this<00:01:01.190> club<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.519> eight<00:01:01.940> would<00:01:02.179> seem<00:01:02.420> a

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
8 this club that eight would seem a

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.900 
8 this club that eight would seem a
little<00:01:02.570> bit<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.989> little<00:01:03.140> bit<00:01:03.350> tight<00:01:03.620> on<00:01:03.649> me<00:01:03.980> so

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
little bit a little bit tight on me so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.760 
little bit a little bit tight on me so
when<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.330> use<00:01:05.480> a<00:01:05.510> size<00:01:05.840> nine<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.410> you<00:01:06.500> see<00:01:06.680> it

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
when we use a size nine so you see it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.130 
when we use a size nine so you see it
covers<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.160> fingertips<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.240> palm<00:01:08.480> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
covers the fingertips and the palm the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.810 
covers the fingertips and the palm the
nylon<00:01:09.590> knit<00:01:09.800> liner<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.370> going<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.640> be

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
nylon knit liner is going to be

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.270 
nylon knit liner is going to be
breathable<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.200> you're<00:01:12.380> going<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.560> global

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
breathable so you're going to global

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.670 
breathable so you're going to global
stay<00:01:13.430> cool<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.720> you'll<00:01:14.960> have<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.170> good

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
grip it's kind of a tacky feel so it has

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.030 
grip it's kind of a tacky feel so it has
it's<00:01:20.360> going<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.600> grip<00:01:20.780> onto<00:01:20.900> things<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.650> not
