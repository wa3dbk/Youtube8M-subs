but differently than most I think
I<00:02:44.770> realize<00:02:45.760> now<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.480> will<00:02:46.570> take<00:02:46.780> time

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
I realize now that it will take time

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.710 
I realize now that it will take time
that<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:48.100> road<00:02:48.310> ahead<00:02:48.460> is<00:02:48.640> long<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.240> shrouded

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
that the road ahead is long and shrouded

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.110 
that the road ahead is long and shrouded
in<00:02:49.840> darkness<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> road<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.910> will

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
in darkness there is a road that will

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000 
in darkness there is a road that will
not<00:02:52.300> always<00:02:52.720> take<00:02:52.960> me<00:02:53.140> where<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.350> wish<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.830> go

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
not always take me where I wish to go

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.530 
not always take me where I wish to go
and<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:55.300> doubt<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.810> will<00:02:55.840> live<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.380> see<00:02:56.410> its<00:02:56.740> end

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
and I doubt I will live to see its end

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.589 
and I doubt I will live to see its end
but<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.570> will<00:02:58.780> travel<00:02:59.050> down<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.590> nonetheless

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.649 

or<00:03:03.140> at<00:03:03.319> my<00:03:03.499> sidewalks<00:03:04.159> hope<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.420> face<00:03:05.629> of

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
or at my sidewalks hope in the face of

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.580 
or at my sidewalks hope in the face of
all<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.230> insists<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:06.980> turn<00:03:07.249> back<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.819> carry<00:03:08.299> on

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
all that insists I turn back I carry on

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.280 
all that insists I turn back I carry on
this<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.319> my<00:03:12.560> compromise
