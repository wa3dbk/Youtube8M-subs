keeping<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> same<00:02:44.110> angles<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.310> same

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
keeping the same angles and the same

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.390 
keeping the same angles and the same
Heights<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.940> these<00:02:46.090> side<00:02:46.299> parts<00:02:47.040> actually<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
Heights on these side parts actually the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.770 
Heights on these side parts actually the
back<00:02:48.760> one<00:02:48.940> would<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.360> raised<00:02:49.659> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
back one would have to be raised a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.170 
back one would have to be raised a
little<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.709> basically<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.819> thing<00:02:51.879> is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little bit but basically this thing is

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.640 
little bit but basically this thing is
can<00:02:52.480> accommodate<00:02:52.930> many<00:02:53.109> different<00:02:53.260> sized

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
can accommodate many different sized

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.440 
can accommodate many different sized
panels<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.220> lot<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> newer<00:02:54.879> panels<00:02:55.299> are

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
panels a lot of the newer panels are

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.380 
panels a lot of the newer panels are
wider<00:02:55.689> than<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:57.579> design<00:02:57.940> makes<00:02:58.209> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
wider than this so this design makes it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.759 
wider than this so this design makes it
pretty<00:02:58.659> simple<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.200> know<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.530> keep<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
pretty simple you know just keep the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.800 
pretty simple you know just keep the
same<00:02:59.950> angles<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.579> just<00:03:01.359> change<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.780> few

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
same angles and just change a few

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.589 
same angles and just change a few
lengths<00:03:02.290> here<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.250> you'd<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.209> fine

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
lengths here and there and you'd be fine

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.599 
lengths here and there and you'd be fine
you<00:03:04.930> can<00:03:05.079> also<00:03:05.200> shorten<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.920> if<00:03:06.099> you've<00:03:06.459> got

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
you can also shorten this if you've got

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.250 
you can also shorten this if you've got
a<00:03:06.639> really<00:03:06.940> short<00:03:07.120> solar<00:03:07.420> panel<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.930> could

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
a really short solar panel you could

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.530 
a really short solar panel you could
make<00:03:08.409> this<00:03:08.530> thing<00:03:08.709> half<00:03:08.920> as<00:03:09.099> long<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.859> it's<00:03:12.639> 32

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
make this thing half as long and it's 32

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.960 
make this thing half as long and it's 32
inches<00:03:13.900> wide<00:03:13.959> down<00:03:14.379> here<00:03:14.650> plus<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:14.980> wheels<00:03:15.310> so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
inches wide down here plus the wheels so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.910 
inches wide down here plus the wheels so
it'll<00:03:16.180> roll<00:03:16.389> through<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> 36<00:03:17.260> inch<00:03:17.379> wide<00:03:17.620> door

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
it'll roll through a 36 inch wide door

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.740 
it'll roll through a 36 inch wide door
if<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.970> needed<00:03:19.180> to

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
if you needed to

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.410 
if you needed to
you<00:03:19.870> could<00:03:20.109> probably<00:03:20.769> shrink<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.519> some<00:03:22.389> of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
you could probably shrink the some of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.210 
you could probably shrink the some of
the<00:03:22.540> bottom<00:03:22.810> parts<00:03:23.049> in<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.260> little<00:03:23.440> bit<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.129> you

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the bottom parts in a little bit so you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.589 
the bottom parts in a little bit so you
could<00:03:24.459> get<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.790> fit<00:03:24.940> through<00:03:25.120> normal<00:03:25.420> doors

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
could get it to fit through normal doors

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.379 
could get it to fit through normal doors
and<00:03:25.870> stuff<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.200> that

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
and stuff like that

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.449 
and stuff like that
it's<00:03:28.389> totally<00:03:28.780> up<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.220> there's<00:03:30.220> another

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
it's totally up to you there's another

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.970 
it's totally up to you there's another
shot<00:03:30.579> with<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.060> battery<00:03:31.359> out<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.260> basically

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
shot with the battery out so basically

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.009 
shot with the battery out so basically
you<00:03:33.549> have<00:03:33.699> two<00:03:34.540> main<00:03:34.780> supports<00:03:36.870> coming<00:03:37.870> down

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
you have two main supports coming down

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.789 
you have two main supports coming down
like<00:03:38.199> this<00:03:40.049> connecting<00:03:41.049> under<00:03:41.379> each<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.709> the

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
like this connecting under each of the

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.960 
like this connecting under each of the
two<00:03:41.829> sides<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:44.799> have<00:03:44.949> an<00:03:45.099> upper<00:03:45.430> crossbar

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
two sides you have an upper crossbar

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.319 
two sides you have an upper crossbar
here<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.980> two<00:03:47.980> lower<00:03:48.220> crossbars<00:03:48.879> which<00:03:49.120> make

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
here and two lower crossbars which make

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.780 
here and two lower crossbars which make
kind<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:49.660> like<00:03:49.780> an<00:03:49.900> axle<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.560> they're<00:03:51.459> made<00:03:51.639> to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
kind of like an axle and they're made to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.900 
kind of like an axle and they're made to
support<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.209> battery<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:53.730> two<00:03:54.730> small

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
support the battery then two small

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.229 
support the battery then two small
seven-inch<00:03:55.480> crossbars<00:03:56.019> go<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.410> between<00:03:57.239> to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
seven-inch crossbars go in between to

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.659 
seven-inch crossbars go in between to
tie<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:58.930> all<00:03:59.109> together<00:03:59.260> screws<00:03:59.949> going<00:04:00.190> down<00:04:00.430> in

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
tie it all together screws going down in

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.729 
tie it all together screws going down in
screws<00:04:01.120> going<00:04:01.359> through<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.629> sides<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.109> then

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
screws going through the sides and then

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.680 
screws going through the sides and then
this<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.220> just<00:04:03.250> an<00:04:03.549> accessory<00:04:03.849> tray<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.389> can

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
this is just an accessory tray you can

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.659 
this is just an accessory tray you can
move<00:04:04.989> this<00:04:05.109> anywhere<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.560> want<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.949> also<00:04:06.400> made

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
move this anywhere you want I also made

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.309 
move this anywhere you want I also made
a<00:04:06.699> small<00:04:07.030> bracket<00:04:07.299> here<00:04:07.569> to<00:04:07.599> hold<00:04:07.840> my<00:04:08.019> charge

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
a small bracket here to hold my charge

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.349 
a small bracket here to hold my charge
controller<00:04:08.769> in<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.190> vertical<00:04:09.459> position<00:04:09.730> up

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
controller in a vertical position up

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.689 
controller in a vertical position up
under<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.900> front<00:04:11.310> because<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.340> don't<00:04:12.579> have

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
under the front because you don't have

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.869 
under the front because you don't have
to<00:04:12.819> access<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.299> too<00:04:13.510> much<00:04:13.629> and<00:04:14.639> also<00:04:15.639> you'll

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
to access that too much and also you'll

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:34.560 
to access that too much and also you'll
notice<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.750> very<00:04:16.930> strong

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.510 

so<00:04:35.140> you<00:04:35.230> can<00:04:35.440> put<00:04:35.560> all<00:04:35.680> kinds<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:36.040> batteries<00:04:36.370> in

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
so you can put all kinds of batteries in

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.860 
so you can put all kinds of batteries in
here<00:04:36.550> if<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:37.000> wanted<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.570> could<00:04:37.690> probably

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
here if you wanted to you could probably

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.660 
here if you wanted to you could probably
widen<00:04:38.410> these<00:04:38.560> out<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.160> could<00:04:39.310> put<00:04:39.490> two

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
widen these out and you could put two

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.330 
widen these out and you could put two
golf<00:04:39.970> cart<00:04:40.270> batteries<00:04:40.720> back<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.290> from<00:04:42.040> Sam's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
golf cart batteries back here from Sam's

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.610 
golf cart batteries back here from Sam's
Club<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:43.330> six<00:04:43.600> volts<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.020> they<00:04:44.500> would

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
Club to six volts and they would

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.070 
Club to six volts and they would
actually<00:04:44.740> fit<00:04:45.130> on<00:04:45.250> this<00:04:45.480> another<00:04:46.480> option<00:04:46.870> too

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
actually fit on this another option too

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.590 
actually fit on this another option too
