okay he doesn't seem to be willing to
cooperate<00:02:54.710> in<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.430> certain<00:02:55.760> way<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.180> we'll<00:02:56.330> need

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
cooperate in a certain way so we'll need

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780 
cooperate in a certain way so we'll need
to<00:02:56.600> find<00:02:56.750> another<00:02:57.050> way<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:57.620> we're<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.520> control

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
to find another way so we're in control

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.710 
to find another way so we're in control
and<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.230> little<00:03:00.440> symbol<00:03:00.740> appearing

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and you see this little symbol appearing

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.660 
and you see this little symbol appearing
this<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:02.960> re<00:03:04.030> re<00:03:05.050> stands<00:03:06.050> for<00:03:06.410> added<00:03:07.160> reality

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
this is re re stands for added reality

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.290 
this is re re stands for added reality
interface<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.600> glasses<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.940> globe

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
interface and it's glasses and a globe

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.810 
interface and it's glasses and a globe
now<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.470> scan<00:03:12.740> your<00:03:13.010> environment<00:03:13.190> just

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
now you can scan your environment just

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.660 
now you can scan your environment just
pressing<00:03:14.180> r1<00:03:14.450> wherever<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.380> are<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:16.070> it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
pressing r1 wherever you are and it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.370 
pressing r1 wherever you are and it
scans<00:03:17.030> your<00:03:17.210> environment<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.900> looks<00:03:18.110> for

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
scans your environment and looks for

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.010 
scans your environment and looks for
traces<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.150> DNA<00:03:20.800> pheromones<00:03:21.970> fingerprints

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
traces of DNA pheromones fingerprints

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.380 
traces of DNA pheromones fingerprints
traces<00:03:24.020> whatever<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.220> be<00:03:25.340> detected<00:03:25.670> by<00:03:25.940> your

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
traces whatever can be detected by your

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.990 
traces whatever can be detected by your
device<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.590> here<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.070> can<00:03:28.220> check<00:03:28.430> pheromones

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
device so here you can check pheromones

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 
device so here you can check pheromones
for<00:03:29.210> example<00:03:29.600> clothing<00:03:29.960> in<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> air<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.830> we

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
for example clothing in the air and we

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.680 
for example clothing in the air and we
discovered<00:03:31.490> there<00:03:31.640> are<00:03:31.730> traces<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.180> orchid

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
discovered there are traces of orchid

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.020 
discovered there are traces of orchid
pollen<00:03:33.110> floating<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.830> air<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.850> that's

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
pollen floating in the air so that's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.430 
pollen floating in the air so that's
interesting<00:03:35.270> because<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.930> killer<00:03:36.170> leaves

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
interesting because the killer leaves

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.490 
interesting because the killer leaves
orchids<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.910> chest<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.270> his<00:03:38.330> victims<00:03:38.810> so

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
orchids on the chest of his victims so

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.050 
orchids on the chest of his victims so
it<00:03:39.590> may<00:03:39.740> mean<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.160> he<00:03:40.280> was<00:03:40.460> there<00:03:40.670> oh<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:40.940> can

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
it may mean that he was there oh we can

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.420 
it may mean that he was there oh we can
see<00:03:41.240> blood<00:03:41.450> here<00:03:41.900> there's<00:03:42.620> traces<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.160> blood

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
see blood here there's traces of blood

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.030 
see blood here there's traces of blood
so<00:03:43.880> when<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.150> touch<00:03:44.390> with<00:03:44.690> your<00:03:44.900> globe<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
so when you touch with your globe the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.620 
so when you touch with your globe the
samples

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
samples

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.760 
samples
you<00:03:48.200> analyze<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.800> directly<00:03:50.170> like<00:03:51.170> future<00:03:51.560> cop

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
you analyze it directly like future cop

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.120 
you analyze it directly like future cop
yeah<00:03:53.410> seriously<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:54.650> does<00:03:54.800> this<00:03:54.890> take<00:03:55.100> place

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
yeah seriously when does this take place

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.570 
yeah seriously when does this take place
is<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:56.360> very<00:03:57.080> near<00:03:57.380> future<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.430> not

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
is it it's very near future but it's not

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.350 
is it it's very near future but it's not
sci-fi<00:03:59.030> or<00:03:59.270> anything<00:03:59.540> it's<00:03:59.900> really<00:04:00.020> now<00:04:01.360> it's

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
sci-fi or anything it's really now it's

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.120 
sci-fi or anything it's really now it's
just<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.960> Jews<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.200> got<00:04:03.440> some<00:04:03.620> cool<00:04:03.800> tricks

just the Jews you got some cool tricks

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.550 
just the Jews you got some cool tricks
it's<00:04:05.120> something<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.660> is<00:04:05.780> close<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.050> exists

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
it's something that is close to exists

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.260 
it's something that is close to exists
actually<00:04:06.740> with<00:04:07.160> black<00:04:07.370> light<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.970> detect

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
actually with black light you can detect

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.380 
actually with black light you can detect
traces<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.750> blood<00:04:09.580> you<00:04:10.580> know<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.880> huge<00:04:11.120> reality

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
traces of blood you know a huge reality

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.660 
traces of blood you know a huge reality
is<00:04:11.660> something<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.170> starts<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.620> exist<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.550> we

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
is something that starts to exist so we

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.970 
is something that starts to exist so we
see<00:04:13.850> these<00:04:14.000> traces<00:04:14.300> of<00:04:14.480> blood<00:04:14.840> leading<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.830> the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
see these traces of blood leading to the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.180 
see these traces of blood leading to the
acid<00:04:16.459> bath<00:04:17.110> let's<00:04:18.110> have<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> look<00:04:18.590> at<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.860> acid

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
acid bath let's have a look at the acid

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.980 
acid bath let's have a look at the acid
bath

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.110

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
when you got blood leading to an acid

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.219 
when you got blood leading to an acid
