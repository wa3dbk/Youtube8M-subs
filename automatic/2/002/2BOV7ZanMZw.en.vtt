to this stage it seems to take an
eternity<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.679> find<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> game<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:15.210> says

or back in Bacau into such a teeny

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.900 
or back in Bacau into such a teeny
you're<00:00:28.619> successful<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.429> there's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you're successful and there's a lot of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.569 
you're successful and there's a lot of
fun<00:00:30.179> about<00:00:30.570> involved<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.340> best

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
fun about involved it's not the best

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.400 
fun about involved it's not the best
thing<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> world

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
thing in the world

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.090 
thing in the world
so<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:35.040> fix<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.710> set<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
so this fix as it were is to set up a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.869 
so this fix as it were is to set up a
private<00:00:38.309> match<00:00:39.559> it<00:00:40.559> doesn't<00:00:40.920> matter<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.610> map

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
private match it doesn't matter what map

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389 
private match it doesn't matter what map
you<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.320> mode<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.739> important

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you do on but the game mode is important

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
you do on but the game mode is important
it<00:00:44.910> seems<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> only<00:00:45.539> work<00:00:45.930> an<00:00:46.140> objective<00:00:46.739> based

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it seems to only work an objective based

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.010 
it seems to only work an objective based
game<00:00:47.489> modes<00:00:47.789> ie<00:00:48.289> domination<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.610> sabotage<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
game modes ie domination and sabotage I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
game modes ie domination and sabotage I
will<00:00:52.020> suggest<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.370> sabotage

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
will suggest that you do on sabotage

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
will suggest that you do on sabotage
because<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.829> need<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> spend<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.550> bit

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because you need to spend a little bit

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
because you need to spend a little bit
time<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> map<00:00:57.510> 45<00:00:58.140> seconds<00:00:58.649> seems<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
time on the map 45 seconds seems to be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
time on the map 45 seconds seems to be
the<00:00:59.370> sort<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> region<00:01:00.710> sabotage<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> best

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the sort of region sabotage is the best

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.830 
the sort of region sabotage is the best
one<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> run<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.690> your

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
one because you have to run from your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
one because you have to run from your
spawn<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> bomb<00:01:04.920> -<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> bomb<00:01:05.580> plan<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
spawn to the bomb - the bomb plan and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640 
spawn to the bomb - the bomb plan and
then<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> detonate

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
then with it detonate

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.940 
then with it detonate
you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.970> domination<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you can do it on domination but if you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
you can do it on domination but if you
do<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> domination<00:01:11.700> let's<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> cap<00:01:12.570> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
do in domination let's say you cap a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.219 
do in domination let's say you cap a
flag<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.260> C<00:01:13.530> depending<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.790> spawn

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
flag a or C depending where you spawn

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
flag a or C depending where you spawn
let<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> ticket<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
let it do it for a ticket and then you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.990 
let it do it for a ticket and then you
quit<00:01:18.770> some<00:01:19.770> things<00:01:20.009> work<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.759> doesn't

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
quit some things work but it doesn't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
quit some things work but it doesn't
seem<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> almost<00:01:23.070> like

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
seem to be very good it's almost like

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.630 
seem to be very good it's almost like
you're<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.270> given<00:01:24.600> enough<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:25.250> again<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.460> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you're not given enough time again up to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
you're not given enough time again up to
yourselves<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.360> would<00:01:27.570> suggest<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
yourselves but I would suggest that you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
yourselves but I would suggest that you
do<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:29.119> sabotage<00:01:31.189> doesn't<00:01:32.189> matter<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:33.060> at

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
do it on sabotage doesn't matter now at

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.219 
do it on sabotage doesn't matter now at
this<00:01:33.210> point<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> you've<00:01:33.840> done<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this point that you've done what you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.580 
this point that you've done what you
need<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.979> don't<00:01:35.189> need<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> touch<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.590> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
need to do you don't need to touch it do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
need to do you don't need to touch it do
I'm<00:01:37.799> doing<00:01:38.159> try<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.490> yourself<00:01:38.729> occupied<00:01:39.000> for

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
I'm doing try keep yourself occupied for

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.440 
I'm doing try keep yourself occupied for
20<00:01:39.600> seconds<00:01:40.020> maybe<00:01:40.729> drink<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:41.880> something<00:01:42.299> but

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
20 seconds maybe drink or something but

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
20 seconds maybe drink or something but
the<00:01:42.689> point<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.110> you've<00:01:43.439> done

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the point is that you've done

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
the point is that you've done
ie<00:01:45.390> score<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.260> points<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.860> give<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
ie score some points and give it a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.800 
ie score some points and give it a
couple<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.580> seconds<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.920> almost<00:01:49.920> catch<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.550> now

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
couple of seconds to almost catch on now

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.360 
couple of seconds to almost catch on now
I'm<00:01:51.810> shitting<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.260> over<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370
