a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.929> different<00:01:55.109> talents<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.810> don't

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a lot of different talents so I don't

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.999 
a lot of different talents so I don't
think<00:01:57.929> there's<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.109> wrong<00:01:58.289> way<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.499> do<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.859> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
think there's a wrong way to do it I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
think there's a wrong way to do it I
think<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.569> our

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
think that what we do is with our

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.859 
think that what we do is with our
customers<00:02:01.109> is<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:02.240> not<00:02:03.240> educate<00:02:03.659> them<00:02:03.749> but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
customers is will not educate them but

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
customers is will not educate them but
work<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.740> project<00:02:05.249> and<00:02:05.340> say<00:02:05.490> okay

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
work with them on a project and say okay

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
work with them on a project and say okay
you<00:02:05.789> know<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.689> great<00:02:06.869> idea

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you know what if that's a great idea

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.590 
you know what if that's a great idea
but<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:07.859> we<00:02:07.950> did<00:02:08.130> this<00:02:08.340> or<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.479> know

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
but if we did this or this you know

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.840 
but if we did this or this you know
maybe<00:02:09.810> that'd<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.170> cool<00:02:10.320> too<00:02:10.590> because<00:02:11.070> it's

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
maybe that'd be cool too because it's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.620 
maybe that'd be cool too because it's
still<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> reflection<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:13.020> them

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
still got to be a reflection of them

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.380 
still got to be a reflection of them
with<00:02:13.930> us<00:02:14.200> kind<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.590> involved<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.000> like

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
with us kind of involved in it so like

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.600 
with us kind of involved in it so like
the<00:02:16.990> portholes<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> 48<00:02:17.980> Roadmaster

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the portholes on a 48 Roadmaster

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.720 
the portholes on a 48 Roadmaster
portholes<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:20.620> didn't<00:02:20.830> come<00:02:20.950> out<00:02:21.010> until<00:02:21.160> 49

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
portholes they didn't come out until 49

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.790 
portholes they didn't come out until 49
I<00:02:22.060> find<00:02:22.540> out<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.320> didn't<00:02:23.500> want<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> use

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
I find out so we didn't want to use

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.950 
I find out so we didn't want to use
portals<00:02:24.430> off<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.550> different<00:02:24.760> car<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.570> owner

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
portals off a different car so the owner

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.000 
portals off a different car so the owner
goes<00:02:26.140> well<00:02:26.290> gosh<00:02:26.500> should<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.740> cool<00:02:26.860> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
goes well gosh should be cool that

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.860 
goes well gosh should be cool that
portals<00:02:27.490> on<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.240> then<00:02:28.360> my<00:02:28.480> brother<00:02:28.660> went

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
portals on it so then my brother went

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.360 
portals on it so then my brother went
about<00:02:28.990> doing<00:02:29.290> some<00:02:29.530> drawings<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.100> they

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
about doing some drawings and they

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.060 
about doing some drawings and they
wanted<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.000> decide<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:32.020> kind<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> shape<00:02:32.890> he

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
wanted to decide what kind of shape he

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.530 
wanted to decide what kind of shape he
liked<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.550> then<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.730> went<00:02:33.820> about<00:02:34.030> building

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
liked and then we went about building

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.990 
liked and then we went about building
the<00:02:34.630> portholes<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:36.130> wouldn't<00:02:36.340> had<00:02:36.490> portals

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the portholes so it wouldn't had portals

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.790 
the portholes so it wouldn't had portals
unless<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.240> customer<00:02:37.720> would<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> gave<00:02:38.590> us<00:02:38.710> that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
unless a customer would it gave us that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.290 
unless a customer would it gave us that
idea<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:39.430> he<00:02:39.610> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.820> let<00:02:39.940> us<00:02:40.060> run<00:02:40.270> with

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
idea and then he kind of let us run with

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.470 
idea and then he kind of let us run with
the<00:02:40.540> ball<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:41.740> great<00:02:41.920> when<00:02:42.910> you're

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
the ball so that's great when you're

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.740 
the ball so that's great when you're
building<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.960> car<00:02:44.140> divers<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.420> that

that<00:02:47.140> kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> project<00:02:48.010> can<00:02:48.070> take<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> really

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
that kind of a project can take a really

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.380 
that kind of a project can take a really
long<00:02:48.850> time<00:02:49.300> really<00:02:49.690> long<00:02:49.960> time<00:02:50.850> does<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.090> crew

we<00:03:00.190> liked<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.940> keep<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.270> keep<00:03:01.300> what<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:01.660> call

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
we liked we keep we keep what we call

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.600 
we liked we keep we keep what we call
three<00:03:02.050> cars<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.380> rotation<00:03:02.860> one<00:03:03.040> starting

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
three cars and rotation one starting

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.630 
three cars and rotation one starting
ones<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> middle<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.510> ones<00:03:04.660> finishing

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
ones in the middle and ones finishing

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.340 
ones in the middle and ones finishing
but<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.760> always<00:03:06.940> think<00:03:07.180> they<00:03:07.270> have<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> be<00:03:07.570> done

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
but we always think they have to be done

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.840 
but we always think they have to be done
in<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> timely<00:03:08.710> fashion<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.400> they<00:03:09.520> don't<00:03:09.670> get

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
in a timely fashion so they don't get

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.270 
in a timely fashion so they don't get
too<00:03:10.000> old<00:03:10.180> or<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:11.320> know<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.650> ideas<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.220> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
too old or you know the ideas and you
