00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello hi with you elena chinkova 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.170
 today we will talk about very important 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.839
 topic 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.000
 this is a nose correction how to narrow the nose like 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 make it smaller for that to us 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 will need a small brush from 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 natural nap for correction to us 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 need to take a tan member 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 I type in two products on a brush 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 necessarily shake off remove on hand 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.779
 so we put on the nose is the shade 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.930
 because here we play with light and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.359
 shadow and carefully draw two 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.870
 smooth well and on the side surfaces 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 back of the nose of the front surface and lay down 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 under such light and weightless 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.440
 movements like i do we we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 denote this line metal to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 make the nose shorter we need 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.360
 obscure a little tip of the nose but exactly 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.520
 between the nostrils then it will be 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.840
 look natural and draw 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.000
 second nike livino 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.000
 and connect these lines to the bottom 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.100
 that's what we do now, we got 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 need a clean fluffy tassel 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.740
 for example, for shading diets 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 tassel we neatly tidy 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 we shade our line the most important thing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.820
 so that these lines were noticeable to me 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.039
 then to further narrow down your nose more we 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.950
 choose a light shade and the rector too 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.530
 on a soft brush and people 100 grams 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.509
 small duck line is literally there 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.560
 a few millimeters on the front 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:50.229
 surface of the nasal bridge and once again all 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.959
 good with stew if the mood is at 3 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.659
 very wide there for example potatoes 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.229
 in order for the audience to reduce it and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.289
 narrow down 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.229
 we need then not opening us three 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.229
 like this I do and 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.349
 soft brush blend our 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.459
 so we reduced our but with
