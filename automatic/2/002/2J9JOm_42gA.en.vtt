00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.310
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 the sun or the world lotta love of led 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.230
 zeppelin and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 teach phrase by phrase and note note 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.150
 like the idea well let's do it what 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 First of all I have to tell you that this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.280
 he only has six sentences and between 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 phrase and phrase does this give two chords 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.730
 from my fifth 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.950
 said that we go with the first sentence that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.950
 he does so 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.469
 to play it we go to the bottom 14 of the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.950
 third rope with ring we make a 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.220
 bending 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.610
 and we press with indexes on frets 12 of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.170
 the second fret 12 of the first and 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 now we come to the second string where 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.870
 We do 15 12 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.870
 we make 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.140
 12 and we return to the fret 14 being mendi 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.780
 we have this 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.649
 and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.500
 a little faster 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.500
 i 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.120
 i 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.120
 i 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.440
 after that comes the second sentence 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.440
 he does so 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 to play it we are going to come to fret 2 of 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.110
 the third string with the middle finger the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.799
 of glory and we drag to the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.799
 fret 4 now we use fret 3 of the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.289
 second string with index and we go back to 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.540
 third agreement at 34 and we drag 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.520
 going 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.520
 and we lift the air 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.090
 m 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.090
 we return to give 2 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.370
 third rope fret 2 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.740
 2004 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 I do not have 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 we already have this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.010
 i 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 this is not what you want to practice 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.519
 all after that we come another phrase 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.519
 a little easier because yes 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.540
 start as the first sentence we come to 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.030
 fret 14 of the third string we do 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.180
 a bending 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 fret 12 of first and second string and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.600
 now on second string fret 15 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 bending we return to give and fret 15 the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.450
 first string with medicaid and again 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.450
 bendine in fret 15 of the second 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.450
 today 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.319
 next phrase do you like this 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 we see behind 17 the second string and 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.700
 then we support 3 frets higher with 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.530
 the ring finger fret 20 and we make a 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.830
 blessed all you can be two bulls 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.830
 and a half 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.069
 we relax fret 17 third string 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.819
 fret 18 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.420
 fret 20 again of second string and 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.420
 17 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.750
 the following phrase 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.410
 it's simpler than the previous one we press 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.120
 in fret 17 of the second string and 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:14.350
 we come to the fry 19 of the first 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.989
 bending relax 19 7 8 17 and now 20 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.900
 of the second string 17 of the third 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.470
 second other of 2017 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.470
 why 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.100
 and finally we reach the last phase 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.539
 all right 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.229
 and this phrase simply frets 17 of the 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.830
 second after fret 19 and we started to 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.830
 be sold 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.630
 we give 19 fret first string with 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.630
 pinky and fret 17 according to agreement 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.210
 and we already have the six sentences now what 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.249
 What I'm going to do is touch them slowly 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.900
 a free time and then we're going to 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.749
 play along with the track 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.090
 accompaniment first slow and then to 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.520
 the speed close to the topic is worth going 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.520
 there slowly first 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.690
 i 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.790
 Hello 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.100
 m 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.849
 how 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.869
 Now let's play it together with the 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.869
 backing tracks 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.460
 and 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.550
 with this 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.550
 now 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.419
 now a little faster 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.020
 ah 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.450
 do not 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.980
 because this has been the kind of how to play 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.210
