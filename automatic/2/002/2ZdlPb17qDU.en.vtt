00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 this bolivar victory 3 to 2 over the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.460
 abstract many situations of goal 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.920
 from start to finish because the two sought 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.950
 permanently the arch the arch 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.420
 front here again I leave an error 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.880
 right leg out and not 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.620
 left in but the ball 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 ends up embedded in the 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.300
 bow I feel that the two were looking for that is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 how nice pedro that had exit by the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 laterals had arrived with the four 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 side markers that have that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 encounter we show or we mark in some 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.130
 moment the importance of changes in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 orientation attack from the left and 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.579
 change front to the sector 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 right attack by right and change of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 front towards the left sector how many 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.570
 Goal situations had both 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.059
 teams in this in this match 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.609
 played players that not only do not 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.680
 collective but individually marked 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.239
 difference because those of capdevila in the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.890
 first time those of Sanchez Carabina in 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 the first time was very important 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.199
 considering that he had a partner to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 a partner and close that was leandro 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 malware that got lost in the second 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.080
 time with another in the second half and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.300
 he did not feel much anger he felt 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 bolivar look what you talked about with 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.310
 him but you said and I agree with you what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 It took its toll Portugal coach 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.070
 leandro my work maybe for some 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.590
 errors in the last minutes 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.300
 in the balance in general in the balance 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.580
 general ends up suffering how much 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.430
 because he had not found another man 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.800
 like how leandro mai walker is the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.690
 partner justly and not only that 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.290
 he had magicians but he also disappeared 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.509
 being on the court sanchez capdevila 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 this occurred the tie that in a 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.890
 I told you when I see more 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.300
 I integrate physically better with the team 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.690
 the strongest but the rabbit played towards 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.369
 forward white starts with the one who plays 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.560
 the ball that starts the play in the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.690
 Center point of the court is William 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 ferreira and the one who defines is william 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
 ferreira william touches forward and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 is going to look for the rabbit got a 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.369
 barbarous habilitation between lines and of 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.860
 the definition that we can say 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.170
 they gave us a great game they gave us 5 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 goals an arbitration at the height of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.730
 classic that he never died because he did not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.070
 this meeting was defined until 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.600
 the blessed match is over whether it's the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.610
 football but and hopefully we can continue 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.040
 taking for all households of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.070
 Bolivia this kind of matches that we 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.510
 They gave away today the 2 bolÃ­var and the 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.910
 strongest until the final minute of 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.600
 goal scorer 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.600
 they are complicated
