pulling<00:04:11.340> some<00:04:11.519> poppers<00:04:11.849> today<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.180> I'll<00:04:12.360> just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
pulling some poppers today so I'll just

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.440 
pulling some poppers today so I'll just
let<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:13.409> one<00:04:13.730> slide<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.970> onto<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.239> mean

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
let that one slide it onto the mean

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.660 
let that one slide it onto the mean
light<00:04:18.530> good<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:19.650> action<00:04:20.130> going<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.400> here

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
the pantograph on this model actually

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.120 
the pantograph on this model actually
works<00:06:50.020> you<00:06:51.020> can<00:06:51.200> have<00:06:51.380> it<00:06:51.470> actually<00:06:51.740> wired<00:06:51.950> to

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
the overhead container II but I don't

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.100 
the overhead container II but I don't
think<00:06:54.830> I'll<00:06:54.980> bother<00:06:55.130> with<00:06:55.400> that<00:06:55.960> I'll<00:06:56.960> be
