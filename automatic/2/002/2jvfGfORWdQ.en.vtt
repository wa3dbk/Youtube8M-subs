so<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> Jamaica<00:01:11.280> between<00:01:11.610> against

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so when I got to Jamaica between against

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
so when I got to Jamaica between against
the<00:01:12.420> Jamaica<00:01:12.840> franchise<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.470> Jamaica<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the Jamaica franchise in Jamaica so it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
the Jamaica franchise in Jamaica so it
would<00:01:14.760> definitely<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.270> something<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.500> look

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
would definitely be something to look

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
would definitely be something to look
forward<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.670> micro<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.750> Jamaica<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
forward to what micro in Jamaica and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
forward to what micro in Jamaica and
working<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.130> Antigua<00:01:20.580> players<00:01:20.820> and

working with with Antigua players and
stuff<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.869> mean<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> argues

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
stuff like that but I mean it argues

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
stuff like that but I mean it argues
well<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> entire<00:01:24.119> Caribbean<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.960> we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
well for the entire Caribbean that we

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
well for the entire Caribbean that we
can<00:01:25.380> show<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.640> Caribbean<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
can show that this is this Caribbean is

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.850 
can show that this is this Caribbean is
a<00:01:27.299> region<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.810> different<00:01:28.200> different<00:01:28.590> players

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a region of different different players

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
a region of different different players
so<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> very<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.659> the
