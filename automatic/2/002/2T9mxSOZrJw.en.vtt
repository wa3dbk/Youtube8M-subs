00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the body a straight line and then start

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.070 
the body a straight line and then start
to<00:01:56.850> flare

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
to flare

it come out thin from the shoulders and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.630 
it come out thin from the shoulders and
get<00:02:04.360> thicker<00:02:04.660> when<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:05.440> some<00:02:05.920> muscle

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
get thicker when there is some muscle

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.070 
get thicker when there is some muscle
mass<00:02:06.850> as<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.880> elbow<00:02:10.390> we're<00:02:10.869> going

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
mass as we get to the elbow we're going

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.750 
mass as we get to the elbow we're going
to<00:02:11.140> make<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.850> kind<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.320> hardened<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.760> then

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to make that kind of hardened and then

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
to make that kind of hardened and then
we're<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.210> curve<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.050> give<00:02:17.350> them

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
we're going to curve out and give them

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.430 
we're going to curve out and give them
some<00:02:17.830> muscle<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:21.010> forearm<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:22.440> then

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
some muscle in the forearm and then

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.680 
some muscle in the forearm and then
those<00:02:23.680> hands<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.870> curving<00:02:26.350> out<00:02:27.210> there<00:02:28.210> are<00:02:28.390> two

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
those hands or curving out there are two

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
those hands or curving out there are two
fingers<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:30.040> are<00:02:30.280> circular<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.810> shape<00:02:32.340> two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340

fingers<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.030> an<00:02:34.300> opposing<00:02:34.900> thumb<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.890> there's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
fingers and an opposing thumb so there's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.410 
fingers and an opposing thumb so there's
one<00:02:36.460> circle<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.420> make<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> loop<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:40.150> is

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
one circle to make a loop and here is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.580 
one circle to make a loop and here is
the<00:02:40.930> thumb<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:42.060> will<00:02:43.060> do<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.420> same<00:02:43.810> thing<00:02:44.230> on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the thumb I will do the same thing on

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:53.420 
the thumb I will do the same thing on
this<00:02:44.890> side

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.039 

the<00:02:54.090> ways<00:02:54.299> we're<00:02:55.049> going<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.319> make<00:02:55.409> an<00:02:55.560> oval<00:02:57.049> and

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
the ways we're going to make an oval and

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.399 
the ways we're going to make an oval and
it's<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.890> long<00:02:59.310> vertical<00:02:59.760> one

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
it's going to be a long vertical one

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.959 
it's going to be a long vertical one
we're<00:03:01.409> going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.620> stop<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.219> right<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.270 

continue<00:03:05.969> here<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.629> when<00:03:07.620> we<00:03:07.739> get<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.099> this

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
continue here and when we get to this

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.229 
continue here and when we get to this
point<00:03:08.670> I'm<00:03:09.439> bringing<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:10.590> oval<00:03:11.040> over<00:03:11.939> here

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
point I'm bringing that oval over here

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.080 
point I'm bringing that oval over here
at<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.049> waist<00:03:13.530> we're<00:03:14.489> going<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.700> start<00:03:14.939> out

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
at the waist we're going to start out

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.240 
at the waist we're going to start out
with<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.299> hips<00:03:15.629> we're<00:03:16.620> coming<00:03:16.950> out<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.219> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
with the hips we're coming out with a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.670 
with the hips we're coming out with a
big<00:03:17.549> curve<00:03:17.939> it's<00:03:18.510> actually<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.530> look

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
big curve it's actually going to look

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.009 
big curve it's actually going to look
like<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:22.069> chicken<00:03:23.069> leg<00:03:25.280> there's<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.609> knee<00:03:27.019> okay

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
like a chicken leg there's the knee okay

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.509 
like a chicken leg there's the knee okay
now<00:03:28.230> we're<00:03:28.409> going<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> curve<00:03:28.919> in<00:03:29.159> this<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
now we're going to curve in this is

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.289 
now we're going to curve in this is
lower<00:03:29.849> part<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.419> leg<00:03:31.819> there's<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.939> circle

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
lower part of the leg there's a circle

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.089 
lower part of the leg there's a circle
here<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:34.079> don't<00:03:34.829> know<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.010> that's<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.340> heel<00:03:35.669> bone

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
here I don't know if that's a heel bone

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.539 
here I don't know if that's a heel bone
will<00:03:38.099> curve<00:03:38.519> inward<00:03:38.879> for<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.959> arch<00:03:40.549> flatten

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
will curve inward for the arch flatten

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.039 
will curve inward for the arch flatten
the<00:03:41.700> bottom<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.500> make<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> round<00:03:44.120> toe<00:03:45.120> same

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
the bottom and make a round toe same

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.959 
the bottom and make a round toe same
thing<00:03:46.519> second<00:03:47.519> toe<00:03:47.989> plan<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.349> bottom<00:03:49.680> and

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
thing second toe plan on the bottom and

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:55.780 
thing second toe plan on the bottom and
then<00:03:50.969> curve<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.169> back<00:03:52.500> up<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.010> meet<00:03:53.700> there

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
then curve it back up and meet there

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.450 
then curve it back up and meet there
same<00:03:56.790> thing<00:03:57.060> over<00:03:57.209> here

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.400 

tail<00:04:05.980> it's<00:04:06.980> going<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.820> continue<00:04:08.240> from<00:04:09.170> this

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
tail it's going to continue from this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.470 
tail it's going to continue from this
area<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.070> stomach<00:04:10.460> and<00:04:10.580> it's<00:04:11.180> going<00:04:11.360> to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
area on the stomach and it's going to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.360 
area on the stomach and it's going to
curve<00:04:11.900> up

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.199 

turn<00:04:15.970> all<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.540> way<00:04:16.570> up<00:04:16.930> loop<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.070> come<00:04:19.000> back

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
turn all the way up loop and come back

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.379 
turn all the way up loop and come back
down<00:04:19.269> as<00:04:19.900> we<00:04:20.859> get<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.130> end<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.760> gets<00:04:21.940> like

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
down as we get to the end it gets like

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.760 
down as we get to the end it gets like
thicker<00:04:23.050> like<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> paddle<00:04:24.600> then<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.960> thins<00:04:26.530> out

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
thicker like a paddle then it thins out

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.420 
thicker like a paddle then it thins out
again<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:29.040> then<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.160> runs<00:04:30.310> parallel<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:32.430> about

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
again and then it runs parallel to about

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.820 
again and then it runs parallel to about
this<00:04:33.639> point<00:04:35.400> where<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:37.180> begins<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:38.080> thicken

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
this point where it begins to thicken

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.540 
this point where it begins to thicken
and<00:04:39.190> back<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> body<00:04:40.770> knit<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.250> thinner

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and back to the body knit with a thinner

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.170 
and back to the body knit with a thinner
marker<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.330> am<00:04:43.780> going<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.350> make<00:04:44.850> two<00:04:45.850> curved

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
marker I am going to make two curved

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.930 
marker I am going to make two curved
lines<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:48.070> is<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> stylistic<00:04:49.470> mu2<00:04:50.940> so

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
lines this is a stylistic mu2 so

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.379 
lines this is a stylistic mu2 so
anything<00:04:52.750> goes<00:04:53.940> inside<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.389> eyes<00:04:57.150> I'm<00:04:58.150> going
