00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.990
 Well, on besklevya something anyone canned

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.880
 Mom is waving rods here such 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 bite and walls never even bite everything 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.190
 there they drink tea in general, nothing to do here 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.869
 we were wiped out until the evening 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.720
 Well, at night, plus there too 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.860
 left shrimp goby this thing 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 overeat he soft worm such here 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 in the morning there were no worms and there it was necessary 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.340
 behind them a little there is not in every place 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.009
 you can dig them needed to come back 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 about five kilometers ago here we are with godfather 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.579
 go digging worms 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.799
 left a man near the fishing rods 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.810
 which is actually 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.740
 I saw a mad coil almost 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 the first time life's actually become 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 practically guard the fishing rods plainly not 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.560
 explaining how to use this case 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.520
 your two hours to the fields and worms 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:08.340
 go back I joked grief of the incident 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:13.530
 imagine distribute us friend 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.799
 shishkin cathedral rods sitting goes 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.680
 crazy bite around here and he sits 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.250
 and on the bag with peeling himself was joking 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 joked we start to drive up and there we go 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.329
 just below is such a barkhank 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:36.919
 and watch work all over 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:42.150
 just going work means fishing rods 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:45.419
 driving up we are cold he is just in 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.310
 this moment pulls out the pelengas on 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:56.880
 the shore grabs his round eyes burn 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:02.010
 two fishing poles lie on the shore where you 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:05.010
 says to ride and there is such a bite 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 i go harry too two fishing rods cut short 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.230
 I'm alone left Perry scared afraid 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.019
 me people perry throws here and I before 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.120
 this is how to leave for a worm cross with 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.820
 took you off so he won't say so 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.100
 lose it when dug in the water put on 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.049
 on it and that means just takes off 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.799
 peering with slightly missing him two 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.489
 hands falls to his knees and such is what 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.739
 life-giving cross makes 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.620
 in general, is it time your hands are shaking and then how 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.500
 a pack comes up and you need it for it 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.900
 time to catch the maximum amount 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.220
 grab a bite well and respectively 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.859
 I begin to realize them 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.280
 these fishing rods are torn off tangled 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.350
 hands tremble shivering and the people shoulder to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:03.150
 shoulder next to pull out one by one 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:05.870
 in the end we caught 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.729
 five bags of pelengas 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.180
 it was the only fishing and then 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.290
 everything 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 how many did not go 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.400
 who did not have a single pelengas 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:23.770
 Could not catch here recently 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.540
 It turned out that this is due to the fact that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.820
 buried Kherson region not buried 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.800
 stopped prokapyvat restore 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.330
 duct in the so-called dairy estuary 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.669
 the time when the climate Zero wali 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.669
 pelengas 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.780
 VAZ sea its acclimatized 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.930
 through this estuary there is crazy 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.990
 zooplankton food supply it almost 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.010
 not 10 times there concentration 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 than the Azov Sea, respectively, with a hammer 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.690
 very fast, the water is warm there 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.500
 all the eggs develop and then all this 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.560
 the case went through this duct 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.840
 in the Sea of ​​Azov and pelengas was very 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.789
 a lot just 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:19.919
 Nemer and Ukraine, in general, this thing 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.810
 No funds found 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.990
 autumn storms this estuary constantly 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:34.159
 forgets that this is a fly this little thing or something 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.159
 opposes the farig interestingly took under 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:42.740
 here generally as ceased to dig 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.180
 this duct this milky estuary 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.129
 actually pelengas stopped and he 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.940
 yourself to go there to spawn and 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.690
 the herd resumed in the Sea of ​​Azov 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.960
 it means the duct stopped prokapyvat 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.060
 pelengas stopped coming spawns in 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.400
 In general, we have three years in a row this year. 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.729
 not even going anymore but before that two years 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.529
 drove completely here is so 2000 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.240
 fishermen all over this 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:15.449
 arabic arrow and nobody has anything 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:19.199
 here is no longer spawns shouting 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.210
 Two years ago like it was for the 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.860
 Novorossiysk let's say the side 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:31.969
 Kuban apparently he goes into these 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.969
 VAZ oh-oh-oh 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:44.020
 VAZ estuary and carry 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:56.530
 This I understand resistance that you sho 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:59.040
 pelamida count up let's dream small 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.040
 cut off 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:19.540
 here it is such a fine pelamid yes 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.050
 you can say it completely by chance 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:26.230
 have caught 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.950
 bluefish from the bottom here I lower the sweetness 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.660
 I feel that well, I’m so in time that well 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:39.160
 yes she could not yet so quickly give 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:41.950
 their fishing line sagged so it happens too fishing line 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.800
 I sagged I thought in scad can sex 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.020
 water 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.780
 I tried to pull such a broach 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.420
 see how it hangs and it hangs 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:08:00.450
 so the tip to the rooms is almost 

00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:00.450
 bent down 3 saw tags before flew
