00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.460
 all the steps step by step and then 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.300
 we hope to give a solution to the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.280
 problem then we absolutely must 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 have the cable vga what you find 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.250
 in the playstation packaging 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:00.480
 that of the playstation 2 is also fine 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.280
 same and the cable that I do not know the name 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.330
 exact which allows you to connect 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 videotaped dvd to TV 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:19.430
 ok let's first connect ours 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.430
 vga cable to have station and later 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.049
 then dvd 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.340
 ok 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:56.610
 after that we go to connect the dvd 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:02:00.350
 to the respected because I have nothing to do with it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.020
 they are two or have two categories 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:10.380
 different this other than output 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.269
 instead that other one is of input you see ce 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 there is one here a language this input which 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.489
 was all no this is input this is 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 out 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:26.910
 ok then with come to the TV 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.959
 I put it there from the word av1 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.890
 want you can put it where you want 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:39.180
 the important in earth that functional then 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.680
 of which there does not interest us at this 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.680
 point we turn on our console 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.750
 let's go to hdmi 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 if we have it on hdmi 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.960
 photosensitive epilepsy color 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.630
 Coliseum 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.270
 Now we connect our 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:19.290
 account and let's go to the settings 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:24.350
 settings we have on settings of 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:29.580
 display and let's change 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.620
 setting the video output io 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.520
 I was there in HD I don't know I started in 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:41.940
 theme should be changed to av multi scart 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:48.710
 the last we do right 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.710
 let's make rgb and change 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:58.940
 at this point we take ours 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.590
 VCR had to be done first 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.590
 we hope to do in time 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.880

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.570

 TV be synonymous if you have it 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:19.020
 in 4 0 100 in four texts I conclude 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:25.290
 as you can see I went by 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:29.860

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:46.500
