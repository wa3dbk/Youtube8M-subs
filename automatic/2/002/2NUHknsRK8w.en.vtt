00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.780
 bring this little program to go 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 soon I bring more things more 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 ancient even more classical and today I 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.170
 you want to bring very basic things and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.670
 that burn me in the hands so much is this way 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.289
 that I do not have the entire collection but 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.150
 I want to share it with you that stops 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 that's the primitive sprite to have 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.820
 something immediate is about the keychains 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.769
 I am a lover of key chains and are the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
 new keychains that will come to Spain the 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.250
 next year they are already selling in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.589
 germany and has put an advance to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 that we can see together are keyrings 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.210
 they sell in this nice format worth 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.040
 before you remember they were sold in a few 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 small bags but not now it has already 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.559
 given its corresponding number with the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.030
 Fel face cardboard with the photographs 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.589
 so we can see which are the ones 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.379
 have the ones that do not and so be more 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.140
 collectibles are as I say are six 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.720
 I want it is not these four more themes 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909
 seven keychains are worth I say as well as I 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'll be wrong, there are 407 keychains 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.340
 effectively bring 4 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 so that we see them are the reference 66 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.119
 13 66 15 66 16 and 66 18 let's start 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.250
 for example for this crackling here 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.030
 - I am increasing the format is a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.549
 cardboard that opens inside 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.950
 appear all the keychains that there are 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.750
 7 different models is made of such 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.030
 way that when it starts it's aero 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.469
 then you load the cartoncito at the moment 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 I'm not going to break it, you do not have to 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.950
 are saved and also so beautiful are 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.349
 can see perfectly without having to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.329
 break it and on the back then 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:56.099
 nothing comes the typical of facebook 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 the legal warning et cetera and by 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.810
 inside as I say the in the different 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.329
 references that comes with the word 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.989
 collectable very well as this is the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.340
 boy of the 66 13 that I'm going to place 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.119
 here we are going to place mines and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 funny 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.810
 and so 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.970
 what is he 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.590
 I'm going to say the skater but it's not the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.480
 boy just the young guy 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.870
 the modern one that comes with his pants 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.870
 so with pockets the jersey with him 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.700
 the cap behind the letters in front 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.710
 with the word speed speed the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.710
 so cool hairs and crazy 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.320
 lately in these in these dolls and 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.850
 Well, it 's a way, I think 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.170
 has playmobil to bet on the subject 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.760
 of the keychains that up to now good if 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.590
 It was like a gift that was given many 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.670
 times when you bought in if yes now 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.430
 not because it has become something 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.190
 properly collectable and labellable 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680
 and all the rest 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.920
 this is 66 13 here comes the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.210
 simbolito red dot and I have it 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.370
 I think that is what gets the most 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.530
 when they have for example on motorcycles 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.020
 in the horses in these houses key that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.830
 they have to express is expressing 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.740
 will have to come the different 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.580
 models that there are when you do not have one you 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.760
 It stings the best but if it comes inside 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.860
 all there is and you do not have that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.710
 it works you go to your house of bad roll 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.540
 of having gone with four and I was fine 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.660
 come with bad roll with bad roll you 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:34.070
 pica we go to 66 15 what is the opinion 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.080
 I like it, I like it 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.400
 little dolls not told to wet but I 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.860
 like because this one in particular does not 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.440
 like nothing that is the police 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.880
 look at the one who designed this as I do 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.180
 I of original policy that is a 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.000
 police because this is equal to mine 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.640
 cartoncito the price not said 499 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.459
 euros will go worth the official website 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.110
 of the mobile you can see it yes in 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.840
 Germany this is the policeman that the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.420
 doll do not say anything more than what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.770
 as long as it is the usual doll of 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.150
 police do not have to for example 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.740
 It would be good if they placed some 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.209
 little word behind just made a 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.070
 special public the subject of assets 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.170
 will touch many people are made keychain 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.060
 own then 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.920
 7 to differentiate them are originals of the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.669
 mobile of the previous mounts 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.019
 I would give him something and if I say that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.150
 the closure for example the form of 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.520
 coupling with respect to these 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.780
 since it is much more reliable 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.430
 massifs 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.530
 dots is better 66 15 the police well 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.510
 now the medieval medieval pimp 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.670
 we have 66 16 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.570
 comes with him 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.570
 I am going fishing 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.880
 with the falcon this on the chest the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.320
 armor giorgio this is original I'm not 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.450
 specialist in medieval and I do not know if he has 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.090
 already left in this last roll of 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.130
 medieval may be I do not remember it but 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.060
 I still think it seems original to me 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.220
 nice and head part is that the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.260
 last run brought issues so match 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.270
 but it does not sound to me anyway 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.350
 be that he wants me to be wrong could 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.050
 be worth 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:18.110
 this is the reference 66 16 the de brito 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:21.110
 the last one that taught me and I share them 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.410
 with my friends for collectors 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:33.770
 that I also put you here for you to see 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:37.240

 you say they are especially 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.630
 spectacular not foreseeing that potencie 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.970
 more rights to collect keychains than 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.710
 the doll itself I must say that those who 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.630
 there are some left only that I do not 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.389

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.250
