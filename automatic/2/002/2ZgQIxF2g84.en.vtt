 [Laughter] 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:13.600
 [Music] 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.860
 the sandero is an important spearhead 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.119
 in the model range today cia and om 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.230
 these also sound in the future 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.580
 for example, to leave an alternative 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.919
 are for a car like let's say 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.419
 the volkswagen polo has act years and 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.800
 thoroughly renewed 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.939
 most striking is the sweet colossal 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 nose but in it a new one 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.939
 family face of dacia 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.829
 have that family face already learning 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.360
 know on the lodgy and of course will 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.620
 it also on this car 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.940
 but subcutaneous are also natural 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.940
 sufficient changes to the probes 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 [Music] 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.090
 the interior is of course also under 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.309
 so there are new ones 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 upholstery fabrics visible and it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 dashboard is another setup 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 it does n't get very 4 full 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 but nothing good is wrong with the economy 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 the control buttons are fine 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.329
 place you can easily reach and be 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.350
 easy to operate 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.180
 that has been different with a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 dacia and for the first time in a sandero 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 A multimedia system is now available 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.930
 complete with navigation when it's on space 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 arrive then let the dacia it is not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 easy to beat in the back seat 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.820
 this sandero than a wider one than much of it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.289
 his opponent 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.180
 you keep it as an adult, he 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.710
 simply you look like it must and then 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.550
 you still hold at the very back of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 trunk and decent space left 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:36.990
 [Music] 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 for the Dutch market this is 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 sandeel only to get with a 0.9 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.420
 liter three-cylinder engine and therefore direct 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.490
 a very modern engine we have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.720
 get to know recently in the clio and then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 why the very enthusiastic about it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 and now also just because again 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.750
 an ethical and world owns that engine 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 good 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.409
 hello you can say he is slightly higher 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 has CO2 emissions and that he has 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.390
 does not qualify for 14 percent 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.790
 addition 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.980
 but for 20% 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.820
 [Music] 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:14.080
 [Applause] 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:15.940
 [Music] 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.370
 as long as you leave this block on top 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.600
 say 25 holds under rpm 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.940
 performs nice and smooth red comes 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.740
 because then you can drive a dome like 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.280
 you really are in a hurry then you have to be big 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.290
 delete 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.760
 that too is no problem what insight and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.410
 engine speed 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.390
 What you notice then is that you are with a 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
 budget have to do because the engine 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.700
 then makes quite a bit more noise than 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.929
 in the cleo 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.929
 [Applause] 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.920
 [Music] 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.709
 drive through the dacia is certainly good 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.239
 mother if you take a book then you feel 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.920
 well that he wants quite a word 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.530
 but your wheels don't 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.510
 easy grip and if you drive by then 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.040
 you pray enough comfort 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.319
 switch send then I am a little less 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.530
 satisfied with it goes without feeling and 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.530
 ask 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.610
 [Music] 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.130
 No 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.470
 [Music] 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.240
 the new sandero mainly makes a step 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 again the application of the modern 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.530
 three-cylinder engine known to be the cleo 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.540
 he seems to like it now 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.780
 but if you continue you can still do something 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.100
 noise that the cleo again less 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.020
 properties are not unpleasant though 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.090
 move beacons so does this new one 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.070
 dacia again not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.600
 is the strong point of the new dacia 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.380
 And it doesn't have to surprise you still 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.380
 they offer space 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.430
 and all against and that is not 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.080
 relatively attractive price 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.330
 because for just under 11 mail he was present 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.419
 the dealer 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.419
