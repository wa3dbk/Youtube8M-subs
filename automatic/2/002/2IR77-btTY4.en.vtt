is a single frame in the trailer if you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
is a single frame in the trailer if you
blink<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.719> literally<00:00:52.050> miss<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.559> you're

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
blink you literally miss it if you're

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.139 
blink you literally miss it if you're
watching<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.010> normally<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> definitely<00:00:53.940> will

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
watching it normally you definitely will

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
watching it normally you definitely will
miss<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> starting

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
miss this but it's one of the starting

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
miss this but it's one of the starting
frames<00:00:56.370> where<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.539> magician

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
frames where you can see the magician

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
frames where you can see the magician
character<00:00:58.530> running<00:00:58.770> away<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.850> group<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
character running away from a group of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.990 
character running away from a group of
zombies<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> sign<00:01:02.129> behind<00:01:02.520> him

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
zombies and we can see a sign behind him

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
zombies and we can see a sign behind him
and<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.329> might<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.049> look<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.559> much<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and this might not look like much to you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
and this might not look like much to you
but<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.640> zoom<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.119> behind<00:01:06.780> his<00:01:07.020> shoulder

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
but if we zoom in behind his shoulder

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
but if we zoom in behind his shoulder
you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.549> stamp<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.510> words<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you can see the stamp of two words the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
you can see the stamp of two words the
bottom<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.920> will<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
bottom one will go into first which is

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
bottom one will go into first which is
very<00:01:12.540> brief<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.320> looks<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.159> word

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
very brief this looks like the word

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
very brief this looks like the word
stall<00:01:15.150> work<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> German<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.560> steel

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
stall work which is German for steel

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
stall work which is German for steel
works<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.090> makes<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> sense<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
works which makes a lot of sense but

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
works which makes a lot of sense but
it's<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> word<00:01:19.979> above<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.790> care<00:01:21.030> more

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it's the word above it that we care more

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's the word above it that we care more
about<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> we're<00:01:21.869> gonna<00:01:21.960> focus<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
about and we're gonna focus on at the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.240 
about and we're gonna focus on at the
moment<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.640> word<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.380> Silesia<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
moment now this word is Silesia now this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
moment now this word is Silesia now this
probably<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:26.790> mean<00:01:26.880> anything<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
probably doesn't mean anything to you

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
probably doesn't mean anything to you
but<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.080> gonna<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.380> jump<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> black

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but we're gonna go jump back to black

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
but we're gonna go jump back to black

thérèse<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> course<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.450> giant

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
thérèse which of course is the giant

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410 
thérèse which of course is the giant
just<00:01:34.650> after<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> events<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.030> happened

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
just after the events of what happened

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.090 
just after the events of what happened
at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> giant<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.470> load<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.740> der

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
at the giant now when you load up der

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.120 
at the giant now when you load up der
riese<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.549> usually<00:01:39.240> gives<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.020> location<00:01:40.710> of

riese it usually gives you a location of

riese it usually gives you a location of
where<00:01:41.460> derice<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.780> says<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.530> located

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
where derice is which says it's located

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.719

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
somewhere near browse lo Germany so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
somewhere near browse lo Germany so
we've<00:01:47.939> fought<00:01:48.180> throughout<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:48.689> years<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we've fought throughout these years that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.130 
we've fought throughout these years that
the<00:01:50.159> Reese<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.610> set<00:01:51.030> somewhere<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.630> Germany

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the Reese is set somewhere in Germany

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
the Reese is set somewhere in Germany
but<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.710> look<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.610> black<00:01:53.850> ops<00:01:54.030> 1

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
but if you go look into the black ops 1

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
but if you go look into the black ops 1
terminals<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> log<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> the

terminals and you go and log on to the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
terminals and you go and log on to the
dreamland<00:01:57.090> server<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.409> log<00:01:58.770> in

dreamland server you can actually log in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
dreamland server you can actually log in
and<00:01:59.130> find<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.939> some<00:02:00.149> additional<00:02:00.630> information

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and find out some additional information

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.840 
and find out some additional information
about<00:02:01.350> der<00:02:01.770> riese<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.399> when<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> say

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
about der riese now when I say

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
about der riese now when I say
additional<00:02:03.180> information<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.170> mean<00:02:04.500> about<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
additional information I mean about the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760 
additional information I mean about the
location<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.390> Reese<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.439> file

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
location of the Reese and in this file

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.490 
location of the Reese and in this file
it<00:02:08.039> says<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.149> these<00:02:09.750> were<00:02:09.959> recorded<00:02:10.379> from

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it says that these were recorded from

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.070 
it says that these were recorded from
the<00:02:10.590> derice<00:02:11.039> test<00:02:11.400> facility<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.180> Lower

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the derice test facility in Lower

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.320 
the derice test facility in Lower
Silesia

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
Silesia

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.020 
Silesia
so<00:02:14.750> derice<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.320> actually<00:02:15.830> taking<00:02:16.580> place<00:02:16.730> in

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
so derice is actually taking place in

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.150 
so derice is actually taking place in
Lower<00:02:17.540> Silesia<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.380> that's<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.710> Reece<00:02:18.890> lash

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
Lower Silesia so that's the Reece lash

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280 
Lower Silesia so that's the Reece lash
the<00:02:19.340> giant<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.570> go<00:02:20.720> look<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:20.960> at

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the giant and then we go look back at

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.530 
the giant and then we go look back at
the<00:02:21.350> shadows<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.860> evil<00:02:22.130> frame<00:02:22.490> which<00:02:23.000> also

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
the shadows of evil frame which also

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.230 
the shadows of evil frame which also
takes<00:02:23.810> place<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.410> Silesia<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.940> sure<00:02:26.150> we'll

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
takes place in Silesia I'm sure we'll

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.000 
takes place in Silesia I'm sure we'll
straight<00:02:26.540> away<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.810> guys<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.380> beginning<00:02:27.830> to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
straight away you guys are beginning to

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.610 
straight away you guys are beginning to
see<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.520> link<00:02:28.790> right<00:02:29.150> there<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.660> sure<00:02:30.020> also

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
see the link right there I'm sure also

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.700 
see the link right there I'm sure also
where<00:02:31.100> we<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.700> little<00:02:32.020> wording<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
where we see the little wording on the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.920 
where we see the little wording on the
trailer<00:02:34.220> frame<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:35.000> looks<00:02:35.210> like<00:02:35.480> there<00:02:35.750> should

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
trailer frame it looks like there should

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.050 
trailer frame it looks like there should
be<00:02:35.960> some<00:02:36.230> wording<00:02:36.440> before<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.310> word<00:02:37.460> Silesia

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
be some wording before the word Silesia

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.120 
be some wording before the word Silesia
so<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.540> could<00:02:38.720> also<00:02:38.930> say<00:02:39.440> Lower<00:02:39.710> Silesia

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so that could also say Lower Silesia

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.180 
so that could also say Lower Silesia
which<00:02:40.820> means<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.300> these<00:02:41.480> two<00:02:41.780> places<00:02:42.380> could

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
which means that these two places could

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.540 
which means that these two places could
be<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.300> same<00:02:44.600> area<00:02:45.200> as<00:02:45.470> well<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.190> also<00:02:46.460> the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
be in the same area as well as also the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.850 
be in the same area as well as also the
back<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.000> fact<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.530> shadows

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
back up the fact that this the shadows

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.650 
back up the fact that this the shadows
of<00:02:48.950> evil<00:02:49.130> map<00:02:49.430> takes<00:02:49.940> place<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.450> fictional

working on this for a long long time and
every<00:03:24.410> single<00:03:24.680> pixel<00:03:25.160> on<00:03:25.550> this<00:03:25.700> map<00:03:25.940> has<00:03:26.420> been

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
every single pixel on this map has been

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.100 
every single pixel on this map has been
meticulously<00:03:27.190> scrutinized<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.120> positioned

meticulously scrutinized and positioned

to be in certain places for certain

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.350 
to be in certain places for certain
reasons<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.440> specifically<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.910> frame

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
reasons and specifically with this frame

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.300 
reasons and specifically with this frame
that<00:03:35.390> we've<00:03:35.690> seen<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.170> trailer<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.739> was

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
that we've seen in the trailer that was

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.370 
that we've seen in the trailer that was
definitely<00:03:37.940> put<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.270> there<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.660> us<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.110> find

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
definitely put in there for us to find

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.890 
definitely put in there for us to find
and<00:03:39.800> noticed<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.400> definitely<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.720> in

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
and noticed that definitely is not in

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.870 
and noticed that definitely is not in
there<00:03:42.170> without<00:03:42.769> some<00:03:43.160> sort<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.519> meaning

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
there without some sort of meaning

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.030 
there without some sort of meaning
behind<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.570> feel<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.050> when<00:03:45.530> we<00:03:45.560> actually

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
behind it I feel like when we actually

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.380 
behind it I feel like when we actually
see<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.430> map<00:03:46.670> properly<00:03:47.090> for<00:03:47.300> ourselves

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
see this map properly for ourselves

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.930 
see this map properly for ourselves
there's<00:03:48.290> going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.769> lot<00:03:49.220> more<00:03:49.519> hints

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
there's going to be a lot more hints

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.120 
there's going to be a lot more hints
like<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.390> but<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.170> only<00:03:51.350> July<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.040> we

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
like this but as it's only July and we

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.550 
like this but as it's only July and we
have<00:03:52.310> three<00:03:52.610> months<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:53.300> until<00:03:53.540> launch<00:03:54.170> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
have three months to go until launch a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.100 
have three months to go until launch a
lot<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.400> just<00:03:55.730> pure<00:03:55.970> speculation<00:03:56.300> but

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
lot of this is just pure speculation but

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.100 
lot of this is just pure speculation but
I'm<00:03:57.260> assuming<00:03:57.890> here<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.269> map<00:03:59.690> shadows

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
I'm assuming here that this map shadows

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.470 
I'm assuming here that this map shadows
of<00:04:00.260> evil<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.739> that<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.340> map<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.910> giant<00:04:02.360> are

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
of evil and that the map the giant are

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.560 
of evil and that the map the giant are
linked<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.290> some<00:04:03.350> way<00:04:03.769> by<00:04:04.430> being<00:04:04.760> in<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.300> same

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
think that idea isn't too far-fetched at

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.770 
think that idea isn't too far-fetched at
all<00:05:57.560> we<00:05:57.770> could<00:05:57.949> have<00:05:58.159> group<00:05:58.520> 935<00:05:58.780> members
