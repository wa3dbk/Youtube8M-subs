Keith in DLA he was recommended to us
from<00:00:51.110> another<00:00:51.260> source<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:52.790> thought<00:00:52.970> he

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
from another source and I thought he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.930 
from another source and I thought he
would<00:00:53.180> come<00:00:53.239> back<00:00:53.570> with<00:00:53.989> kind<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.590> an<00:00:55.280> apples

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940

to<00:00:55.970> apples<00:00:56.449> oranges<00:00:56.780> oranges<00:00:57.410> but<00:00:57.650> just<00:00:57.890> like

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
to apples oranges oranges but just like

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.520 
to apples oranges oranges but just like
look<00:00:58.489> at<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.670> same<00:00:58.879> thing<00:00:59.180> but<00:00:59.660> Keith's<00:01:00.320> in

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
look at the same thing but Keith's in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.439 
look at the same thing but Keith's in
his<00:01:00.650> group<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.190> his<00:01:01.430> King<00:01:01.670> came<00:01:02.239> back

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
his group and his King came back

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.490 
his group and his King came back
actually<00:01:02.809> with<00:01:03.409> a<00:01:03.440> whole<00:01:03.830> different<00:01:04.280> concept

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
actually with a whole different concept

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.260 
actually with a whole different concept
and<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.650> wasn't<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.729> wasn't<00:01:07.880> even<00:01:08.060> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
and it wasn't that it wasn't even a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.090 
and it wasn't that it wasn't even a
money<00:01:08.659> at<00:01:08.960> that<00:01:09.110> point<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.409> was<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:09.530> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
money at that point it was like the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.399 
money at that point it was like the
design<00:01:10.460> we'd<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.120> detail<00:01:11.570> were<00:01:12.229> like

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
design we'd like the detail were like

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.250 
design we'd like the detail were like
like<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.520> whole<00:01:13.700> approach<00:01:14.210> differently<00:01:14.780> they

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
like the whole approach differently they

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.020 
like the whole approach differently they
didn't<00:01:15.440> come<00:01:15.590> back<00:01:15.770> with<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.700> same

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
didn't come back with just the same

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.000 
didn't come back with just the same
thing<00:01:17.510> but<00:01:17.840> came<00:01:18.290> back<00:01:18.470> with<00:01:18.710> really<00:01:18.979> a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
thing but came back with really a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.340 
thing but came back with really a
completely<00:01:19.549> completely<00:01:19.909> different<00:01:20.350> approach

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
completely completely different approach

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.520 
completely completely different approach
to<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.909> had<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.900> lot<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.049> respect<00:01:24.350> for

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
to it which I had a lot of respect for

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.350 
to it which I had a lot of respect for
that<00:01:24.590> actually<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.040> really<00:01:25.280> did<00:01:25.460> he<00:01:25.909> sort<00:01:26.270> of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
that actually I really did he sort of

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.760 
that actually I really did he sort of
took<00:01:27.320> our<00:01:27.560> ideas<00:01:28.190> in<00:01:28.369> mind<00:01:28.580> but<00:01:28.909> he<00:01:29.229> he<00:01:30.229> changed

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
took our ideas in mind but he he changed

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.789 
took our ideas in mind but he he changed
them<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.400> what<00:01:31.810> was<00:01:32.810> going<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.170> be<00:01:33.290> most

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
them to what was going to be most

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.039 
them to what was going to be most
convenient<00:01:34.399> for<00:01:34.700> us<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.750> sounds<00:01:36.020> like

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
convenient for us so it sounds like

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.080 
convenient for us so it sounds like
Keith<00:01:36.380> really<00:01:36.649> paid<00:01:36.979> attention<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:37.759> you

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
Keith really paid attention to what you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.810 
Keith really paid attention to what you
needed<00:01:38.329> without<00:01:39.259> us<00:01:39.649> even<00:01:39.829> knowing<00:01:40.310> what<00:01:40.670> we

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
needed without us even knowing what we

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.880 
needed without us even knowing what we
needed<00:01:41.030> he<00:01:41.390> took<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> look<00:01:41.869> at<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.079> property<00:01:42.619> we

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
