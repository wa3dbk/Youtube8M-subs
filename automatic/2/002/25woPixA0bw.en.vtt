00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.650
 a mental illness can affect anyone 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.320
 Almost a quarter of the patients of a family doctor have to suffer with one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.409
 mental causes 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.339
 of mental illness in the narrower sense are about ten percent of 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.179
 Population affected 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.179
 many of them need help in a psychiatric hospital 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.939
 a particularly serious mental illness is schizophrenia 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 It is the dream when you are a specialist 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.880
 his dream is not experiencing any more unified 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.100
 deliberately 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.960
 and unconscious experiences 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 Real feelings and fears are mixed 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 This normal dream experience matches the everyday experience of one 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 Schizophrenia fell ill 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.740
 he suffers from the impression that his soul is no longer uniform 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.860
 but is broken to pieces 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 he is not released from it by an awakening 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.450
 The patients feel the symptoms very intensely 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.730
 they then feel powerful and unfounded 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 they may be persecuted 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 high threat of foreign thoughts 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 they do not believe the children perceive the other people 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.700
 again and again emotional life experiences violent fluctuations 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 in the motion show up suddenly and suddenly 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.510
 because thinking is also uneven 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.510
 Thoughts chains suddenly tear off 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.350
 Also, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder are common mental illnesses 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.410
 Fears can increase to panic 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 to protect herself from such anxiety attacks the patients confine her 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 Everyday life often more and more 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.180
 Forced actions like excessive hand washing 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.990
 Often, incomprehension is controlled by the patients themselves 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.460
 senselessly experienced 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.069
 an omission 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.480
 Fifteen women from foldable fears that something bad will happen 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.959
 Mental illness can also have an organic cause 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.529
 due to circulatory disorders or am 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.289
 Most commonly the Alzheimer's disease 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.379
 brain cells die off 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 and thus are irrevocably lost in services 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.109
 Patients initially forgot little things then I took 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.509
 after all, the memory only played for seconds 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.609
 For Alzheimer's disease itself also tested no cure 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.449
 the concomitant second drove depression and delusions 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.500
 resulting from an increasing helplessness 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 can be treated 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.949
 a widespread mental illness for example 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.089
 is the depression 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.699
 Almost everyone has a slight feeling of depression or depression 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.259
 funeral hall 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:13.009
 But serious depression is more than just sadness 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.349
 the sick are depressed 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 In the worst case, they can no longer feel 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.149
 Concentration eases 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.149
 Self-esteem is impaired 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.279
 Depression is often the result of the loss of a relative 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.869
 and stress 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.869
 or the fear of failure 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:38.039
 the sick and their relatives seem to be sick because of the disease 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.419
 examine them to hide from the environment 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.419
 mental illness is still considered a blemish by many 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.729
 and there are still reservations about psychiatric treatment
