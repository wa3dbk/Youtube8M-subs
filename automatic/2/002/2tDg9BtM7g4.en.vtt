start with the head you're gonna make a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
start with the head you're gonna make a
section<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> front<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> head<00:00:48.379> that's

a lock twist of two sections that are of
equal<00:00:56.010> length<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.940> twist<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.390> sections<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
equal length so twist two sections of

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
equal length so twist two sections of
equal<00:00:59.280> length<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.559> then<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.680> twist<00:01:01.829> them

the harder balloon twisting abilities

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.850 
the harder balloon twisting abilities
because<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.329> counterintuitive<00:01:58.960> what<00:01:59.740> we

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
because of this counterintuitive what we

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.100 
because of this counterintuitive what we
want<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.159> do<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.369> get<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.610> air<00:02:00.729> from<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
want to do is get the air from here to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.859 
want to do is get the air from here to
the<00:02:02.229> tip<00:02:02.439> here<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.360> would<00:02:04.570> think<00:02:04.600> that

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
the tip here now you would think that

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.109 
the tip here now you would think that
you<00:02:05.020> could<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.350> squeeze<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.829> air<00:02:05.979> up<00:02:06.369> but

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
you could just squeeze the air up but

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.660 
you could just squeeze the air up but
what<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.450> will<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.840> it'll<00:02:08.229> deform<00:02:08.769> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
what that will do is it'll deform the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.210 
what that will do is it'll deform the
shape<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.509> doesn't<00:02:10.810> say<00:02:11.050> at<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> top<00:02:11.440> well

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
shape and it doesn't say at the top well

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.699 
shape and it doesn't say at the top well
you<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.519> have<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.500> you're<00:02:14.500> going

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
you actually have to do is you're going

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.430 
you actually have to do is you're going
to<00:02:14.860> pinch<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.670> tip<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.620> pull<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.769> up<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
to pinch the tip and pull it up and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.259 
to pinch the tip and pull it up and
squeeze<00:02:20.440> from<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> bottom<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:22.060> you're<00:02:22.180> going

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
squeeze from the bottom but you're going

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.220 
squeeze from the bottom but you're going
to<00:02:22.330> want<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.569> squeeze<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> air<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.500> not<00:02:24.160> up

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to want to squeeze the air down not up

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.809 
to want to squeeze the air down not up
by<00:02:26.230> squeezing<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.739> air<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.519> by

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
by squeezing the air down and by

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.850 
by squeezing the air down and by
stretching<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.269> end<00:02:28.510> out<00:02:28.750> what<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.590> end<00:02:29.739> up

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
stretching the end out what we end up

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.820 
stretching the end out what we end up
doing<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.610> creating<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:31.180> localized<00:02:31.599> vacuum<00:02:32.260> so

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
doing is creating a localized vacuum so

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.470 
doing is creating a localized vacuum so
that<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.130> squeeze<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.670> air<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.330> only

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that when I squeeze the air the only

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that when I squeeze the air the only
place<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.880> part<00:02:37.470> with<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
place for it to go is the part with the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.300 
place for it to go is the part with the
lowest<00:02:38.890> pressure<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.849> end<00:02:44.130> giving<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.220> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
lowest pressure the end giving it a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.740 
lowest pressure the end giving it a
couple<00:02:45.459> more<00:02:45.670> squeezes<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.329> there<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.599> have

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
couple more squeezes and there we have

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.600 
couple more squeezes and there we have
our<00:02:46.780> poodle<00:02:47.140> tell

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
