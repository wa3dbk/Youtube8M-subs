00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
staying first sting I think out of the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830 
staying first sting I think out of the
two<00:01:04.010> who<00:01:05.010> wouldn't<00:01:05.129> come<00:01:05.549> back<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.600> who

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
two who wouldn't come back first or who

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
two who wouldn't come back first or who
would<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> W<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:09.150> Ultimate

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
would go to W first I think Ultimate

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.520 
would go to W first I think Ultimate
Warrior's<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.170> likely<00:01:10.590> than<00:01:10.770> sting<00:01:12.530> but

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
Warrior's more likely than sting but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.399 
Warrior's more likely than sting but
that's<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:13.979> opinion<00:01:14.010> though<00:01:14.340> but

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
that's just my opinion though but

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
that's just my opinion though but
staying<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.909> my<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:18.090> favorite<00:01:18.360> wrestler<00:01:18.930> uh

chances of seeing sting in WB are more

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.570 
chances of seeing sting in WB are more
likely<00:02:35.190> than<00:02:35.459> they<00:02:35.819> were<00:02:35.880> before<00:02:36.540> Triple<00:02:37.200> H

saying that it's possible if he signs he

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
saying that it's possible if he signs he
wants<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.090> possible<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.570> more<00:03:00.600> than<00:03:00.870> likely

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
wants not possible it's more than likely

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.300 
wants not possible it's more than likely
he'll<00:03:01.290> get<00:03:01.440> inducted<00:03:01.590> into<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> hall<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.100> fame

he'll get inducted into the hall of fame

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
he'll get inducted into the hall of fame
of<00:03:02.340> designs<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.900> maybe<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> DVD<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
of designs and you know maybe a DVD and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.350 
of designs and you know maybe a DVD and
so<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.100> think<00:03:05.459> it'd<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.610> great<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:05.970> everyone

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
so I think it'd be great for everyone

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.180 
so I think it'd be great for everyone
involved<00:03:06.750> including<00:03:07.080> sting<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.830> think<00:03:08.040> it'd<00:03:08.160> be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
involved including sting I think it'd be

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
involved including sting I think it'd be
a<00:03:08.310> great<00:03:08.489> opportunity<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.150> sting<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.510> make<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
a great opportunity for sting to make a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.110 
a great opportunity for sting to make a
shitload<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.769> money<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.130> lot<00:03:11.370> more<00:03:11.640> money<00:03:11.850> than

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
shitload of money a lot more money than

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.080 
shitload of money a lot more money than
he's<00:03:12.299> made<00:03:12.540> since<00:03:13.190> probably<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.370> late<00:03:14.610> 90s

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
he's made since probably the late 90s

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.500 
he's made since probably the late 90s
with<00:03:15.239> WCW<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.209> don't<00:03:18.420> think

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
with WCW so you know and I don't think

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.080 
with WCW so you know and I don't think
TNA<00:03:19.110> really<00:03:19.410> needs<00:03:19.709> sting<00:03:20.160> right<00:03:20.549> now<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> mean

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
TNA really needs sting right now I mean

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.319 
TNA really needs sting right now I mean
Dave<00:03:21.360> they've<00:03:21.840> had<00:03:22.140> him<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.769> my<00:03:23.579> god<00:03:23.850> on<00:03:24.150> and

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
Dave they've had him for my god on and

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.990 
Dave they've had him for my god on and
off<00:03:24.390> since<00:03:24.630> 2002<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:26.010> full<00:03:26.310> time<00:03:26.549> since

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
off since 2002 I think full time since

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.840 
off since 2002 I think full time since
like<00:03:27.530> 2005<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.920> least<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> yearly<00:03:29.549> contract

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
like 2005 at least on a yearly contract

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.190 
like 2005 at least on a yearly contract
since<00:03:30.329> 2005<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:32.209> don't<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.329> they<00:03:33.840> really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
since 2005 so I don't think they really

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.280 
since 2005 so I don't think they really
don't<00:03:34.290> need<00:03:34.860> sting<00:03:35.310> anymore<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.720> w.e

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
don't need sting anymore but I think w.e

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.170 
don't need sting anymore but I think w.e
is<00:03:39.799> yet<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.459> there<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.850> he's<00:03:42.120> not

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
is yet you have to go there and he's not

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.120 
is yet you have to go there and he's not
getting<00:03:42.510> any<00:03:42.720> younger<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.200> think<00:03:43.440> he's<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.709> 50

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
getting any younger I think he's like 50

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.180 
getting any younger I think he's like 50
40<00:03:44.670> or<00:03:45.000> something<00:03:45.239> like<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.470> but<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.530> still

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
40 or something like that but I still

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.190 
40 or something like that but I still
think<00:03:47.489> there's<00:03:47.670> time<00:03:47.940> there's<00:03:48.299> not<00:03:48.630> very<00:03:48.660> much

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
think there's time there's not very much

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.750 
think there's time there's not very much
time<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.680> still<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.130> there's<00:03:50.280> time<00:03:50.459> for

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
time but I still think there's time for

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.699 
time but I still think there's time for
staying<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.660> make<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.019> jump<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.470> have<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
staying to make the jump and have a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.410 
staying to make the jump and have a
successful<00:03:53.010> match<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> Undertaker

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
successful match with the Undertaker

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.150 
successful match with the Undertaker
hall<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.900> fame<00:03:55.049> induction<00:03:55.380> DVD<00:03:55.890> all<00:03:55.980> that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
hall of fame induction DVD all that

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.120 
hall of fame induction DVD all that
stuff<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.549> still<00:03:57.000> think<00:03:57.180> there's<00:03:57.359> time<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
stuff I still think there's time and

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.319 
stuff I still think there's time and
whether<00:03:59.130> he<00:03:59.220> does<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.790> or<00:03:59.910> not<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.180> totally

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
whether he does it or not it's totally

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
check that out i think it was his last

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.180 
check that out i think it was his last
tweet<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.800> date<00:04:55.979> but<00:04:57.229> basically<00:04:58.229> kind<00:04:59.039> of

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
tweet to date but basically kind of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.890 
tweet to date but basically kind of
buried<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.610> hatchet<00:04:59.759> in<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.360> tweet<00:05:00.660> and

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
buried the hatchet in that tweet and

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.930 
buried the hatchet in that tweet and
he's<00:05:01.530> willing<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:02.070> talk<00:05:02.280> with<00:05:02.460> vincent<00:05:02.820> man

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
he's willing to talk with vincent man

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.460 
he's willing to talk with vincent man
and<00:05:03.120> meet<00:05:03.240> up<00:05:03.360> with<00:05:03.509> him<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.840> talk<00:05:04.050> business

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
and meet up with him and talk business

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.469 
and meet up with him and talk business
so<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:04.740> think<00:05:04.860> that's<00:05:05.639> why<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.910> think<00:05:06.150> warriors

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
so I think that's why I think warriors

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.629 
so I think that's why I think warriors
more<00:05:06.780> likely<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.139> come<00:05:07.289> back<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.889> WB<00:05:08.340> then

more likely to come back to WB then

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.200 
more likely to come back to WB then

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.309 
I think it's safe to say if sting
