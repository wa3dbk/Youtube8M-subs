00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.640
 today we are going to demystify 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.230
 each and every one of these situations 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.929
 let's prepare first of all a 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.039
 vegetarian mayonnaise with a college blog 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.039
 super special 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.680
 let's start by chopping a bit of a 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.220
 little onion let's put some 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.360
 beta carotene as carrots the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.759
 carrots have to be remember 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.680
 perfectly well washed we are going to 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.320
 split in half and we're going to make a 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.320
 rustic cut this is more or less like this 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.300
 the first myth that we are going to destroy with 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.010
 this recipe goes against everyone 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.380
 those who believe that vegetarians 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 Calcium does not consume this product 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.830
 I have my hand the tofu or agglomerate of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 Soybeans have an impressive amount 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.670
 impressive calcium and of course 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 it's pure vegetable protein make 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.120
 a mayonnaise for vegetarians the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 truth is that it had never been so 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.740
 easy this is as simple as using 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.010
 the blender or a processor or shake to 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.480
 the investment that I have we are going to put 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.130
 the piece of tofu 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.350
 inside the kind of tofu that I am 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.080
 using this was gentle there is tofu 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.820
 soft semi firm and firm in case 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.620
 do not get it to this day do not you 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.720
 worry use your regular mayonnaise 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.390
 I have another surprise for you later 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.250
 to add calcium a lot of calcium to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 this traditional recipe of the collection 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.240
 I added olive oil we are going to throw 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.909
 a bit of vinegar the type of vinegar 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320
 I'm using white vinegar 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.900
 we will reduce the acidity of vinegar 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.640
 white with a little sugar in this 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 occasion I am using refined sugar 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 just because I do not want the sugar 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.090
 mascabado meche mayonnaise 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.530
 remember the combination of salt and sugar 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 what it does is enhance the rest of the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 Flavors added salt and tofu over 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.640
 uses the tofu I mean the is 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.090
 it was like the ingredients chameleon 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 since the tofu grabs the flavor that you 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 put is to say if you were cooking 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.870
 a firm tofu on the grill and you put 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.150
 a little barbecue would take the flavor of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 smoke on the grill and the neighborhood but 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 come back with the mayonnaise we add 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
 just a touch of mustard in 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.210
 powder 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.550
 black pepper again 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.010
 touch of garlic that always always 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.680
 it comes well 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.860
 for you now investment one pass 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.300
 nothing else 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.030
 and let's let them go 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.880
 integrating little by little the oil of 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.250
 olive the vinegar and of course the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.600
 protein and calcium the tof nothing more 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.700
 practical to cook with 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.530
 oster appliances like in this 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.100
 occasion that I am using the blender 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.100
 immersion 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.230
 for those who like mayonnaise with 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.540
 a little lemon flavor 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.890
 Well there is always that option 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.440
 add only a few drops of juice 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.780
 of lemon we are breaking the myth of 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.180
 that vegetarians do not comply with their 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.180
 calcium quota or what texture 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.540
 the droplets of lemon juice 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.540
 and finally a little parsley 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.010
 to continue with the college recipe 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.010
 law 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.040
