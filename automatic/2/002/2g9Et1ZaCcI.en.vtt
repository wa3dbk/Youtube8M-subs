hope you enjoyed that video on
benchmarks<00:04:19.110> a<00:04:19.470> lot<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.920> people<00:04:20.040> haven't<00:04:20.340> asked

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
benchmarks a lot of people haven't asked

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.760 
benchmarks a lot of people haven't asked
them<00:04:20.640> for<00:04:20.670> that<00:04:20.850> video<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> while<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:22.590> see

them for that video for a while to see

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.800 
them for that video for a while to see
how<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.980> idol<00:04:23.310> phone<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.760> idol<00:04:24.000> 3<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.540> these

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
how the idol phone the idol 3 and these

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.420 
how the idol phone the idol 3 and these
in<00:04:25.020> phone<00:04:25.200> compared<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.590> each<00:04:25.710> other<00:04:25.890> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
in phone compared with each other the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.820 
in phone compared with each other the
zenfone<00:04:26.640> perform<00:04:27.120> better<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.420> lot<00:04:27.810> better<00:04:27.870> but

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
zenfone perform better a lot better but

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.260 
zenfone perform better a lot better but
when<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.040> comes<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.280> pricing<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.820> benchmarks

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
when it comes to pricing and benchmarks

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.820 
when it comes to pricing and benchmarks
or<00:04:30.330> something<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:31.020> important<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.590> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
or something this important to you I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.470 
or something this important to you I
would<00:04:32.280> say<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.520> zenfone<00:04:32.730> is<00:04:33.060> probably<00:04:33.360> the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
would say the zenfone is probably the

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.320 
would say the zenfone is probably the
better<00:04:33.630> purchase<00:04:33.900> solely<00:04:34.890> because<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.460> you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
better purchase solely because it's you

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.470 
better purchase solely because it's you
get<00:04:36.450> two<00:04:36.570> different<00:04:36.660> variants<00:04:37.170> of<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.800> the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
get two different variants of it and the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.700 
get two different variants of it and the
performance<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.630> device<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:40.050> very<00:04:40.140> smooth

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
performance of the device is very smooth

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.890 
performance of the device is very smooth
we<00:04:41.580> started<00:04:41.820> getting<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.090> higher-end<00:04:42.510> prices

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
we started getting a higher-end prices

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.100 
we started getting a higher-end prices
like<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> LG<00:04:43.350> g4<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.580> s6<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.660> s6<00:04:45.900> edge

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
like the LG g4 and the s6 and s6 edge

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.080 
like the LG g4 and the s6 and s6 edge
those<00:04:46.860> benchmarks<00:04:47.220> are<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.730> be<00:04:47.790> higher

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
those benchmarks are going to be higher

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.940 
those benchmarks are going to be higher
but<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.810> really<00:04:48.960> worth<00:04:49.140> paying<00:04:49.500> four<00:04:49.740> times

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
but is it really worth paying four times

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.740 
but is it really worth paying four times
the<00:04:50.100> cost<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.670> that's<00:04:51.210> I'll<00:04:51.420> leave<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.600> up

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
the cost and that's I'll leave that up

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.410 
the cost and that's I'll leave that up
to<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.200> decide<00:04:52.580> but<00:04:53.580> there<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.300> it

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
to you to decide but there you have it

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.170 
to you to decide but there you have it
benchmark<00:04:54.990> test<00:04:55.260> for<00:04:55.590> these<00:04:55.770> zenfone<00:04:56.340> 2<00:04:56.700> 2day

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
benchmark test for these zenfone 2 2day

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.740 
benchmark test for these zenfone 2 2day
variant<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.320> idol<00:04:58.680> 3<00:04:59.240> opportune<00:05:00.240> touch

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
variant and the idol 3 opportune touch

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.830 
variant and the idol 3 opportune touch
so<00:05:01.230> my<00:05:02.070> choice<00:05:02.340> not<00:05:02.940> because<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
so my choice not because of the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.270 
so my choice not because of the
benchmarks<00:05:04.320> would<00:05:04.470> actually<00:05:04.770> be<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.070> zenfone

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
benchmarks would actually be the zenfone

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.000 
benchmarks would actually be the zenfone
2<00:05:05.640> it's<00:05:06.300> been<00:05:06.450> it's<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.810> consistent<00:05:07.470> phone<00:05:07.620> its

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
2 it's been it's a consistent phone its

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.640 
2 it's been it's a consistent phone its
performance<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.700> really<00:05:08.940> good<00:05:09.090> throughout<00:05:10.080> no

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
performance is really good throughout no

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.110 
performance is really good throughout no
makeups<00:05:10.980> no<00:05:11.100> stutters<00:05:11.460> anywhere<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.030> the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
makeups no stutters anywhere in the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.850 
makeups no stutters anywhere in the
operating<00:05:12.480> system<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.140> i<00:05:13.470> think<00:05:13.680> i<00:05:13.710> like

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
operating system and I i think i like

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.120 
operating system and I i think i like
that<00:05:13.980> phone<00:05:14.390> not<00:05:15.390> better<00:05:15.600> than<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:16.500> g4<00:05:16.890> though

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
that phone not better than the g4 though

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.830 
that phone not better than the g4 though
i'll<00:05:17.730> see<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.000> guys<00:05:18.060> in<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.270> next<00:05:18.390> video<00:05:18.600> she
