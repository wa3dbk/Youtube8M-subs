00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
which I got terrible reviews because

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
which I got terrible reviews because
it's<00:00:51.960> almost<00:00:52.110> no<00:00:52.289> coverage<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.520> feels

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it's almost no coverage and it feels

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's almost no coverage and it feels
cooling<00:00:54.149> yes<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:55.260> pretty<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
cooling yes but that's pretty much it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
cooling yes but that's pretty much it
but<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.340> wanted<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> try<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
but I wanted to try this because I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
but I wanted to try this because I
thought<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.680> would<00:00:58.800> being<00:00:58.949> no

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
thought the other one would being no

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
thought the other one would being no
coverage<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.940> finishing<00:01:00.359> powder<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.629> be

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
coverage the finishing powder would be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
coverage the finishing powder would be
nice<00:01:00.870> cuz<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.219> coverage

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
nice cuz you don't really want coverage

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
nice cuz you don't really want coverage
out<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.409> three

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
out of that they do make this in three

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
out of that they do make this in three
shades<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.010> believe<00:01:05.250> there's<00:01:05.460> translucent

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
shades I believe there's translucent

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.380 
shades I believe there's translucent
which<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:07.340> translucent

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
which is the one I have translucent

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
which is the one I have translucent
light/medium<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.720> might<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
light/medium and there might be a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.060 
light/medium and there might be a
translucent<00:01:10.380> deep<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.590> maybe<00:01:10.770> there's<00:01:10.920> four

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
translucent deep so maybe there's four

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.480 
translucent deep so maybe there's four
shades<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.760> before<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
shades for before there we go but I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.679 
shades for before there we go but I
obviously<00:01:14.760> grabbed<00:01:15.000> translucent<00:01:15.570> just

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
obviously grabbed translucent just

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
obviously grabbed translucent just
because<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.770> fair<00:01:17.040> didn't<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.490> sense<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
because really fair didn't make sense to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.070 
because really fair didn't make sense to
me<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:17.970> grab<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> light<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> medium<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
me to grab the light the medium or the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.920 
me to grab the light the medium or the
deep<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.729> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.030> notice<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.360> mind<00:01:21.570> -<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
deep so if you can notice my mind - I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
deep so if you can notice my mind - I
only<00:01:22.140> poked<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.619> few<00:01:22.860> holes<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.340> because

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
only poked a few holes in there because

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
only poked a few holes in there because
I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> remove<00:01:24.240> those<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I don't like to remove those little

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
I don't like to remove those little
stickers<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.439> there's<00:01:25.590> always<00:01:25.740> too

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
stickers because then there's always too

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.969 
stickers because then there's always too

and it feels wet to the touch which is
really<00:02:55.060> awkward<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.510> if<00:02:55.570> you've<00:02:55.660> ever<00:02:55.780> felt

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
but I do want to set the concealer so it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.550 
but I do want to set the concealer so it
doesn't<00:04:36.280> crease<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.510> perfect<00:04:37.690> way<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:37.960> do

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
doesn't crease and the perfect way to do

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.620 
doesn't crease and the perfect way to do
so<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.830> actually<00:04:39.190> use<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.580> brush<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.090> did

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
so is actually use this brush I did

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.030 
so is actually use this brush I did
apply<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.900> once<00:04:41.110> or<00:04:41.320> twice<00:04:41.350> with<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.830> fluffy

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
apply it once or twice with a fluffy

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.610 
apply it once or twice with a fluffy
brush<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.640> found<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:44.230> didn't<00:04:44.470> work<00:04:44.590> so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
brush but I found that it didn't work so

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.050 
brush but I found that it didn't work so
well<00:04:44.830> maybe<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.310> lot<00:04:45.520> of<00:04:45.610> people<00:04:45.760> use<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.030> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
well maybe I a lot of people use like a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.910 
well maybe I a lot of people use like a
fluffy<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.630> two<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.900> four<00:04:47.110> style<00:04:47.380> brush<00:04:47.650> or

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
fluffy like two to four style brush or

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.230 
fluffy like two to four style brush or
like<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.100> crease<00:04:48.370> brush<00:04:48.550> under<00:04:48.790> their<00:04:48.910> eye<00:04:48.940> I

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
like a crease brush under their eye I

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.850 
like a crease brush under their eye I
didn't<00:04:49.960> like<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.230> with<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.530> liked<00:04:50.770> it

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
didn't like this with that I liked it

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.560 
didn't like this with that I liked it
with<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.010> flat<00:04:51.160> brush<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:52.060> cuz<00:04:52.240> it's<00:04:52.390> better

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
with a flat brush just cuz it's better

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.670 
with a flat brush just cuz it's better
because<00:04:52.720> if<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:52.930> use<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> fluffy<00:04:53.380> brush<00:04:53.470> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
because if you use a fluffy brush it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.500 
because if you use a fluffy brush it
starts<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.220> melt<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:54.910> powder<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.270> guess

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
starts to melt the powder I guess

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.130 
starts to melt the powder I guess
beforehand<00:04:56.110> but<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:56.890> didn't<00:04:57.340> um<00:05:01.140> something

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
beforehand but this didn't um something

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.990 
beforehand but this didn't um something
else<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.350> gonna<00:05:02.500> say<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.860> don't<00:05:03.070> remember<00:05:03.250> but

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
else is gonna say I don't remember but

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.550 
else is gonna say I don't remember but
um<00:05:04.180> like<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.540> said<00:05:04.750> if<00:05:04.870> your<00:05:04.990> dry<00:05:05.140> skin<00:05:05.410> you

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.810 
um like I said if your dry skin you
would<00:05:05.620> probably<00:05:05.920> like<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.310> if<00:05:06.460> your<00:05:06.550> oily

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
would probably like this if your oily

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.700 
would probably like this if your oily
skin<00:05:07.030> no<00:05:07.390> it<00:05:07.570> says<00:05:07.750> suitable<00:05:08.170> for<00:05:08.320> all<00:05:08.410> makeup

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
types or all skin types but I don't mind

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.960 
types or all skin types but I don't mind
it<00:05:11.170> is<00:05:11.320> last<00:05:12.070> thing<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:12.400> know<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.550> lot<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.760> people

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it is last thing I know a lot of people

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.580 
it is last thing I know a lot of people
are<00:05:13.030> gonna<00:05:13.120> ask<00:05:13.300> me<00:05:13.540> how<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.900> compares<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.560> the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
are gonna ask me how it compares to the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.290 
are gonna ask me how it compares to the
Smashbox<00:05:15.280> halo<00:05:15.580> powder<00:05:15.760> because<00:05:16.030> that's<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
Smashbox halo powder because that's the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.700 
Smashbox halo powder because that's the
hydrating<00:05:16.690> one<00:05:16.840> with<00:05:16.990> encapsulated<00:05:17.530> water

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
hydrating one with encapsulated water

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680 
hydrating one with encapsulated water
those<00:05:18.310> don't<00:05:18.580> feel<00:05:18.790> wet<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.240> touch<00:05:19.330> for

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
those don't feel wet to the touch for

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.680 
those don't feel wet to the touch for
one<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.880> won't<00:05:22.090> get<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.330> same<00:05:22.480> kind<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
one so you won't get the same kind of

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.210 
one so you won't get the same kind of
experience<00:05:23.110> with<00:05:23.230> halo<00:05:23.380> halo<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:23.890> a<00:05:24.010> drier

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
experience with halo halo is a drier

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.280 
experience with halo halo is a drier
powder<00:05:24.550> but<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.360> sets<00:05:25.630> that<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:25.990> after<00:05:26.080> about

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
powder but it sets that and after about

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.230 
powder but it sets that and after about
10<00:05:26.470> minutes<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.670> one<00:05:27.820> actually<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.120> find

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
10 minutes and that one actually I find

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.410 
10 minutes and that one actually I find
absorbs<00:05:28.600> oil<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.930> lot<00:05:29.140> longer<00:05:29.350> too<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.550> this<00:05:31.210> one

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
absorbs oil a lot longer too so this one

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.600 
absorbs oil a lot longer too so this one
has<00:05:31.540> no<00:05:31.690> coverage<00:05:32.110> halo<00:05:32.650> even<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.190> yellow<00:05:33.370> one

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
has no coverage halo even the yellow one

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.980 
has no coverage halo even the yellow one
in<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.880> bronze<00:05:34.090> one<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.600> then<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.810> four

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
in the bronze one and then the four

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.420 
in the bronze one and then the four
flush<00:05:35.230> turn<00:05:35.410> shades<00:05:35.620> all<00:05:35.800> have<00:05:35.950> some<00:05:36.100> coverage

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
flush turn shades all have some coverage

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.180 
flush turn shades all have some coverage
so<00:05:37.000> you'll<00:05:37.450> get<00:05:37.570> that<00:05:37.720> those<00:05:38.530> have<00:05:38.770> even<00:05:39.070> more

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
so you'll get that those have even more

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.800 
so you'll get that those have even more
coverage<00:05:39.490> than<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.700> regular<00:05:40.090> Babylon<00:05:40.660> one

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
coverage than the regular Babylon one

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.870 
coverage than the regular Babylon one
was<00:05:41.020> i<00:05:41.290> swatched<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.890> regular<00:05:42.190> revlon<00:05:42.520> one<00:05:42.730> in

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
was i swatched the regular revlon one in

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.760 
was i swatched the regular revlon one in
store<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.330> halo<00:05:43.690> beats<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.080> out<00:05:44.140> like<00:05:44.380> two<00:05:44.680> to

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
store and halo beats it out like two to

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.920 
store and halo beats it out like two to
three<00:05:44.920> times<00:05:45.010> more<00:05:45.190> coverage<00:05:45.640> so<00:05:45.940> if<00:05:46.810> you're

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
three times more coverage so if you're

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.230 
three times more coverage so if you're
looking<00:05:47.050> for<00:05:47.230> a<00:05:47.470> coverage<00:05:47.980> powder<00:05:48.190> versus<00:05:48.940> the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
foundation one of this try the halo one

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.610 
foundation one of this try the halo one
if<00:05:51.640> you<00:05:52.090> want<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.570> finishing<00:05:52.900> powder<00:05:53.170> try<00:05:53.560> the
