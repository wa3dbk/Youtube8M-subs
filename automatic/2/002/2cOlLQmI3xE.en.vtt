00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.219
 you unpack but 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.420
 installing such a core i7 3770 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.470
 ko shaukat lg at 11 55 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 so he will replace my intel core i5 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 2300 20 installed here so first of all 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 I will remove the cooling from 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 processor change the processor hands 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 thermal paste on this one so 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.039
 quickly properly occupy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 some features here no to 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:58.590
 others here so so I'm going 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.199
 install it on this motherboard asus 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.799
 republic of gamer maximus 5 formula 1 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:11.930
 so yes I was saying I'm going to meet 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.590
 cooling here next i'm going 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 simply change processor 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.310
 put back does not tarnish the master 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.210
 cooling is taken and enjoy the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 Intel processor simply so here I 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.590
 will unpack to have the processor with 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 the means of the edge 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:48.450
 gold books list 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.260
 even if manual and pc collection 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.290
 annual steam cvs 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.030
 obviously I thought to do so here we 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.810
 has the cooling provided by intel 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 personally I do not use step by step 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:36.840
 to solicit too much soil very measurements 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:36.840
 farms fanned this one cancer 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.070
 so here we have a party that are in 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.810
 contact with the motherboard so here I am 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.230
 sells off the cooling 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.720
 so I become a piece that is a little 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.570
 damaged several times that I have 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 disassembled all that and so I will use 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.110
 intel cooling for the moment 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.890
 yes I know it's not the best but 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.290
 good not too much choice 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.520
 I'm already secret of watercooling under 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.000
 little and we wait for that change the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.000
 processor 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:43.010
 roof again this year and like 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.970
 I am amazed to use the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 Minitel cooling 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.299
 so have to look well and the arrow 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.769
 I am very firm in any way for 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.050
 the moment the apple must allow to 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:30.970
 put intel cooling knowing 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:33.100
 I'm not a big heart so here's the 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.450
 cooling is installed so that's 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.500
 very simple there are holes and just at 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.590
 put in the holes is then 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:45.790
 installed the tic and it's true I 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.300
 check if they are welcome that's it 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.440
 looks good to me so it's good then we have 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.710
 on the motherboard a small location 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:05:02.590
 denmark and his fans pullovers so we say 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:03.940
 this here it's done drinking all 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.520
 way I do not intend to offer 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.970
 clokey no coffee no ena cooling 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.680
 extreme 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.680
 I will still take watercooling 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:21.340
 and so it does not look good to me 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.120
 I 'm going round branches and then we'll see 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.000
 right now 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.860
 So here it turns any property that has 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.090
 look good to go the fan 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.639
 I added a little thermal paste 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.340
 still what such a in the 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.870
 many windows family starts without 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:42.699
 problem is no plan to reinstall 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:47.540
 or something like that it's all good 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:51.110
 so that's all right she had me m 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.080
 we detected so it was good 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.630
 after level performance I do not know 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.710
 will see well but I'll tell you that in 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.210
 comments if you want to know 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.389
 ask - and that's thank you to all and 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.389
 next
