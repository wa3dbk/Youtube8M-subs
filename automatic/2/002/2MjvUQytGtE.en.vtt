00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
your finger I'm just doing it so get a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.880 
your finger I'm just doing it so get a
focus<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.070> camera<00:01:47.399> doesn't<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
focus on this camera doesn't and you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
focus on this camera doesn't and you
start<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.759> basic<00:01:51.050> item<00:01:52.050> on<00:01:52.229> your

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
start out with a very basic item on your

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.249 
start out with a very basic item on your
back<00:01:52.680> there's<00:01:53.490> items<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.119> game<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
back there's items in this game so you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.450 
back there's items in this game so you
start<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:55.800> plate<00:01:56.039> that's<00:01:56.250> why<00:01:56.369> I'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
start with the back plate that's why I'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.950 
start with the back plate that's why I'm
moving<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.940> slow<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> accelerometer

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
moving so slow with the accelerometer

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
moving so slow with the accelerometer
now<00:01:58.710> let's<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.910> up<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> 32

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
now let's see if I can get up to 32

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.650 
now let's see if I can get up to 32
bucks<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.380> buy<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:02.090> need<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.300> rank

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
bucks so I can buy I need to see my rank

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:16.990 
bucks so I can buy I need to see my rank
went<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:09.360> pick<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.959> sticks

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020 

completely<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.270> um<00:02:18.900> OVO<00:02:19.560> p<00:02:19.800> enabled<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.850> was

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
completely so um OVO p enabled so it was

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.950 
completely so um OVO p enabled so it was
like<00:02:21.210> must<00:02:22.200> make<00:02:22.440> 00<00:02:22.590> p<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> XNA

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
like must make 00 p because the XNA

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.660 
like must make 00 p because the XNA
isn't<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.020> best<00:02:25.320> platform<00:02:25.890> making<00:02:26.160> old<00:02:26.310> piece

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
isn't the best platform making old piece

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.810 
isn't the best platform making old piece
it<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:26.940> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.210> hard<00:02:28.190> touch<00:02:29.190> controls<00:02:29.640> on

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
it was kind of hard touch controls on

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.470 
it was kind of hard touch controls on
the<00:02:30.030> whole<00:02:30.330> capacitive<00:02:30.990> touchscreen<00:02:31.500> idea

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
the whole capacitive touchscreen idea

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920 
the whole capacitive touchscreen idea

my<00:04:08.500> zune<00:04:09.310> HD<00:04:09.459> faster<00:04:10.150> or<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.169> know<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.829> guy

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
my zune HD faster or you know the guy

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.640 
my zune HD faster or you know the guy
who's<00:04:12.340> picking<00:04:12.639> mistakes<00:04:13.030> which<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.720> model

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
who's picking mistakes which is a model

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.500 
who's picking mistakes which is a model
of<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.799> zune<00:04:14.980> HD<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:18.010> does<00:04:18.269> allows<00:04:19.269> for

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
of a zune HD so this does allows for

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
faster points makes more items item list

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.589 
faster points makes more items item list
is<00:04:23.110> probably<00:04:23.410> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.889> be<00:04:23.950> destruction<00:04:24.599> a

is probably going to be destruction a
lot<00:04:26.139> more<00:04:26.710> I'll<00:04:27.220> reads<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.669> from<00:04:27.849> files<00:04:28.090> to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
lot more I'll reads it from files to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.180 
lot more I'll reads it from files to
sell<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.979> generates<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> UI<00:04:30.699> based<00:04:31.030> on<00:04:31.240> files

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
sell it generates the UI based on files

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
sell it generates the UI based on files
that<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.580> counts<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:36.520> then<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:37.380> remembers

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
that it counts for and then it remembers

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.200 
that it counts for and then it remembers
them<00:04:38.560> through<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> code<00:04:39.039> so<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.120> any
