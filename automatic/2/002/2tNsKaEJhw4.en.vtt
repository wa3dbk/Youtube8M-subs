Life<00:01:09.740> well<00:01:10.740> there's<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.400> main<00:01:11.610> aspects<00:01:12.060> for

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
Life well there's two main aspects for

Life well there's two main aspects for
there<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.710> social

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
there for you one is the social

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
there for you one is the social
dimension<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.000> virtual<00:01:15.420> world<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
dimension of virtual world so we have a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
dimension of virtual world so we have a
quite<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> large<00:01:16.890> number<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.250> students<00:01:17.700> going

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
quite a large number of students going

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.530 
quite a large number of students going
into<00:01:18.270> our<00:01:18.420> violence<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> regular<00:01:19.650> basis<00:01:20.009> now

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
into our violence on a regular basis now

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.660 
into our violence on a regular basis now
they<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:22.280> flaps<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.850> rent

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
they have flaps that they can rent

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
they have flaps that they can rent
publicly<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.850> meetin<00:01:27.320> even<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> set<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
publicly can meetin even a set of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.260 
publicly can meetin even a set of
standing<00:01:29.369> stones<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> hold

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
standing stones if they want to hold

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.410 
standing stones if they want to hold
religious<00:01:30.750> ceremonies<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> brings<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
religious ceremonies so it brings that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
religious ceremonies so it brings that
vital<00:01:33.810> social<00:01:34.320> dimension<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.009> students

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
vital social dimension that students

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
vital social dimension that students
miss<00:01:36.119> sometimes<00:01:36.630> over<00:01:36.869> distance<00:01:37.229> University

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
miss sometimes over distance University

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
miss sometimes over distance University
and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.610> there's<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> other<00:01:39.060> aspect<00:01:39.479> which

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and then there's the other aspect which

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
and then there's the other aspect which
is<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.159> learning<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
is what we can do with with learning so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
is what we can do with with learning so
we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> number<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.290> different<00:01:43.560> activities

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
we have a number of different activities

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
we have a number of different activities
taking<00:01:44.369> place<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> moment<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.390> looking

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
taking place at the moment we're looking

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.420 
taking place at the moment we're looking
at<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> possibility<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.380> having<00:01:46.500> residential

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
at the possibility of having residential

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
at the possibility of having residential
schools<00:01:47.820> held<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.720> Second<00:01:49.110> Life

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
schools held in Second Life

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.190 
schools held in Second Life
there<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.390> various<00:01:51.390> learning<00:01:51.570> activities

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there are various learning activities

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.039 
there are various learning activities
small<00:01:52.799> group<00:01:53.070> activities<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.049> lectures

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
small group activities and lectures

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.319 
small group activities and lectures
taking<00:01:55.649> place<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.100> Second<00:01:56.460> Life<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.790> where<00:01:57.000> we

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
taking place in Second Life and where we

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.959 
taking place in Second Life and where we
just<00:01:57.479> experimenting<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.229> seeing<00:01:58.880> what<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just experimenting and seeing what the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.640 
just experimenting and seeing what the
most<00:02:00.119> effective<00:02:00.630> ways<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.290> us<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.580 

I<00:02:04.030> think<00:02:05.030> one<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.930> aspects<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
I think one of the aspects is the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.310 
I think one of the aspects is the
three-dimensional<00:02:07.160> nature<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.990> if<00:02:09.200> you

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
three-dimensional nature of it so if you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.090 
three-dimensional nature of it so if you
go<00:02:09.500> into<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:10.960> web-based<00:02:11.960> environment<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
go into a web-based environment and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.860 
go into a web-based environment and
standard<00:02:13.520> webpage<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.180> see<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.540> seems<00:02:14.720> very

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
standard webpage and see it seems very

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.470 
standard webpage and see it seems very
flat<00:02:15.290> when<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.560> come<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.790> virtual

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
flat when you come out of a virtual

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.540 
flat when you come out of a virtual
world<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.710> ability<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.160> navigate

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
world and it's this ability to navigate

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.880 
world and it's this ability to navigate
in<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.590> three-dimensional<00:02:21.590> space

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
in that three-dimensional space

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.800 
in that three-dimensional space
particularly<00:02:22.340> good<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.790> subjects<00:02:23.240> where

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
particularly good for subjects where

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.780 
particularly good for subjects where
there<00:02:23.990> are<00:02:24.140> three-dimensional<00:02:24.790> concepts

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
there are three-dimensional concepts

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.980 
there are three-dimensional concepts
such<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.000> architecture<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.580> it's<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.630> highly

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
such as architecture so it's this highly

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.780 
such as architecture so it's this highly
immersive<00:02:36.260> nature<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.220> kind<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.580> get

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
immersive nature of it you kind of get

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:48.070 
immersive nature of it you kind of get
