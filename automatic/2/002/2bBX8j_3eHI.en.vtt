hey<00:00:00.989> everyone<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.589> thought<00:00:02.040> I'd<00:00:02.159> give<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.399> an

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey everyone I thought I'd give you an

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.690 
hey everyone I thought I'd give you an
update<00:00:02.580> on<00:00:02.790> my<00:00:03.090> cookie<00:00:03.510> machine<00:00:03.720> project<00:00:04.670> so<00:00:05.670> I

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
update on my cookie machine project so I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.950 
update on my cookie machine project so I
don't<00:00:05.879> know<00:00:05.940> if<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.089> saw<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.359> first<00:00:06.600> video

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
don't know if you saw the first video

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.200 
don't know if you saw the first video
but<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.259> basically<00:00:07.589> got<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.069> carousel<00:00:08.610> sort

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
but I basically got this carousel sort

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.690 
but I basically got this carousel sort
of<00:00:09.360> device<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.349> I've<00:00:10.440> rigged<00:00:10.679> up<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.070> each

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of device that I've rigged up and each

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610 
of device that I've rigged up and each
station<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> carousel<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> have

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
station on the carousel is going to have

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.129 
station on the carousel is going to have
one<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.099> ingredient<00:00:14.639> components<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.990> make

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
one of the ingredient components to make

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410 
one of the ingredient components to make
a<00:00:16.170> chocolate-chip<00:00:16.590> cookie<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.420> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
a chocolate-chip cookie and the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.880 
a chocolate-chip cookie and the
challenge<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.170> biggest<00:00:19.439> challenges

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
challenge one of the biggest challenges

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
challenge one of the biggest challenges
with<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.189> project<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> handling<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
with this project is handling all the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.660 
with this project is handling all the
different<00:00:21.900> types<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.350> ingredients<00:00:22.980> every

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
different types of ingredients every

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
different types of ingredients every
station<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.420> pretty<00:00:24.689> different<00:00:24.930> because

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
station looks pretty different because

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
station looks pretty different because
all<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> ingredients<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.550> different

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
all the ingredients have different

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.240 
all the ingredients have different
properties<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.260> them<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.830> require<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
properties to them that require a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.730 
properties to them that require a
different<00:00:29.609> dispensing<00:00:30.300> method<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> figure

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
different dispensing method so I figure

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.870 
different dispensing method so I figure
I'll<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:31.980> through<00:00:32.189> them<00:00:32.279> briefly<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.730> then

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I'll go through them briefly and then

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120 
I'll go through them briefly and then
describe<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.559> done<00:00:34.770> over<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> last

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
describe what I got done over the last

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
describe what I got done over the last
few<00:00:35.550> days<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> station<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
few days this will be the station that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
few days this will be the station that
dispenses<00:00:38.610> chocolate<00:00:39.059> chips<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> chips

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
dispenses chocolate chips so the chips

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
dispenses chocolate chips so the chips
will<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.770> stacked<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
will be stacked in here and as you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.680 
will be stacked in here and as you
rotate<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.730> specified<00:00:44.730> quantity<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
rotate this a specified quantity of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
rotate this a specified quantity of
chocolate<00:00:46.079> chips<00:00:46.500> will<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.710> dispensed<00:00:47.489> out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
chocolate chips will be dispensed out

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
chocolate chips will be dispensed out
the<00:00:47.789> bottom<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.780> trick<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> volume

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the bottom the trick is that this volume

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
the bottom the trick is that this volume
is<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.039> bit<00:00:50.370> too<00:00:50.550> big<00:00:50.820> right<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
is a little bit too big right now so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
is a little bit too big right now so
what<00:00:51.629> I'm<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:53.370> add<00:00:53.579> some

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
what I'm going to do is just add some

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
what I'm going to do is just add some
solid<00:00:54.300> plastic<00:00:54.840> between<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.379> fins<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
solid plastic between the fins on that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.119 
solid plastic between the fins on that
sort<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> butterfly<00:00:57.360> valve<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.949> when

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
sort of butterfly valve that way when

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.799 
sort of butterfly valve that way when
this<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.460> comes<00:00:59.760> around<00:01:00.090> it'll<00:01:00.329> pick<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this thing comes around it'll pick up a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.250 
this thing comes around it'll pick up a
smaller<00:01:01.140> subset<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.370> chips<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.260> still

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
smaller subset of chips but still

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.230 
smaller subset of chips but still
dispense<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.920> specified<00:01:05.700> number<00:01:05.909> each<00:01:06.210> time

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
dispense a specified number each time

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
dispense a specified number each time
this<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.750> dispenser<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.560> brown

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this will be the dispenser for brown

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
this will be the dispenser for brown
sugar<00:01:11.570> brown<00:01:12.570> sugar<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> probably<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
sugar brown sugar is probably one of the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.789 
sugar brown sugar is probably one of the
most<00:01:13.740> difficult<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.520> dispense<00:01:14.939> ingredients

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
most difficult to dispense ingredients

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.780 
most difficult to dispense ingredients
materials<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> I've<00:01:17.070> ever<00:01:17.250> seen<00:01:17.520> it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
materials that I've ever seen it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.410 
materials that I've ever seen it's
sticky<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.330> granular<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.409> also<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.979> very

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
sticky it's granular it's also not very

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.570 
sticky it's granular it's also not very
free-flowing<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.159> becomes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
free-flowing like it's it's it becomes

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
free-flowing like it's it's it becomes
solid<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> leave<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> cup<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
solid like if you leave it in a cup you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
solid like if you leave it in a cup you
can<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:26.130> turn<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> cup<00:01:26.640> upside<00:01:26.850> down

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
can actually turn the cup upside down

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
can actually turn the cup upside down
and<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.689> packed<00:01:27.990> together<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.130> all

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and it's all packed together so all

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
and it's all packed together so all
these<00:01:29.460> properties<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:29.970> brown<00:01:30.509> sugar<00:01:30.869> very

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
these properties make brown sugar very

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
these properties make brown sugar very
difficult<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> deal<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
difficult to deal with so I'm going to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
difficult to deal with so I'm going to
use<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> same<00:01:33.570> trick<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.110> used<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
use the same trick that I used with the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
use the same trick that I used with the
chocolate<00:01:35.159> chips<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.079> sort<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
chocolate chips I'm going to sort of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
chocolate chips I'm going to sort of
pack<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.650> butterfly-valve<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.850> more

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pack that butterfly-valve up with more

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
pack that butterfly-valve up with more
plastic<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.290> trick<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> rotates

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
plastic and the trick is as it rotates

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
plastic and the trick is as it rotates
around<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.700> actually<00:01:41.790> has<00:01:42.090> sort<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
around it actually has sort of like a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
around it actually has sort of like a
grinding<00:01:43.079> action<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> brown

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
grinding action so if the all the brown

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.789 
grinding action so if the all the brown
sugar<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> packed<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.560> thing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
sugar up here is packed as this thing

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.910 
sugar up here is packed as this thing
turns<00:01:47.130> around<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.210> fins<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.899> chip<00:01:49.680> off<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
turns around the fins kind of chip off a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
turns around the fins kind of chip off a
little<00:01:50.220> bit<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
little bit of it so as this you know it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
little bit of it so as this you know it
may<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.860> exactly<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.369> right<00:01:53.520> amount<00:01:53.579> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
may not get exactly the right amount but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.249 
may not get exactly the right amount but
we're<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.360> using<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> valance<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we're going to be using the valance to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.749 
we're going to be using the valance to
actually<00:01:55.979> measure<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.399> amount<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
actually measure the amount of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.700 
actually measure the amount of
ingredients<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> come<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
ingredients that have come out so what I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380 
ingredients that have come out so what I
can<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.310> make<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> volume<00:01:59.969> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
can do is just make the volume in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
can do is just make the volume in
between<00:02:00.899> fins<00:02:01.229> smaller<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.829> smaller<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
between fins smaller and smaller and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.999 
between fins smaller and smaller and
just<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.600> rotations<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.770> enough

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just use more rotations to get enough

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.830 
just use more rotations to get enough
total<00:02:05.729> volume<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:08.209> some<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.390> easier<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
total volume out some of the easier to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.020 
total volume out some of the easier to
deal<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.020> ingredients<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.950> say<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.640> sugar

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
deal with ingredients are say the sugar

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.800 
deal with ingredients are say the sugar
so<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.200> granular

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
so this is granular

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.110 
so this is granular
but<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.050> pretty<00:02:14.230> free-flowing<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
but it's pretty free-flowing and so the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.790 
but it's pretty free-flowing and so the
method<00:02:16.420> I'm<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.720> use<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:16.930> both<00:02:17.230> sugar

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
method I'm going to use for both sugar

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
method I'm going to use for both sugar
and<00:02:18.099> salt<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:21.209> helical<00:02:22.209> screw<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.840> hand

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and salt is a helical screw on hand

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.839 
and salt is a helical screw on hand
drill<00:02:23.290> bit<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.650> case<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.849> high

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
drill bit in this case this is a high

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.509 
drill bit in this case this is a high
helix<00:02:28.330> angle<00:02:28.480> drill<00:02:28.840> bit<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> there's

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
helix angle drill bit and is it there's

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.670 
helix angle drill bit and is it there's
a<00:02:30.580> chamber<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.989> here<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.380> looks<00:02:32.560> about

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
a chamber in in here that looks about

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.160 
a chamber in in here that looks about
like<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.150> when<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> drill<00:02:34.660> bit<00:02:34.840> turns

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
like this so when the drill bit turns

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.040 
like this so when the drill bit turns
counterclockwise<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:37.150> pulls<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.690> little<00:02:37.810> bit

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
counterclockwise it pulls a little bit

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.430 
counterclockwise it pulls a little bit
of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.489> salt<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.760> case<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.290> there's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
of the salt in this case out and there's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.180 
of the salt in this case out and there's
a<00:02:41.530> dispensing<00:02:42.250> port<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> bottom<00:02:44.190> I'm

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
a dispensing port on the bottom I'm

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.890 
a dispensing port on the bottom I'm
using<00:02:45.489> tape<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.299> hold<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.569> together

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
using tape just to hold this together

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.449 
using tape just to hold this together
for<00:02:47.170> now<00:02:47.319> what<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> need<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> little<00:02:48.130> pulley

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
for now what I need is a little pulley

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.250 
for now what I need is a little pulley
system<00:02:49.000> which<00:02:49.480> I've<00:02:49.630> already<00:02:49.810> ordered<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
system which I've already ordered the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.289 
system which I've already ordered the
parts<00:02:50.470> for<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.880> motor<00:02:52.750> speeds<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
parts for but the motor speeds and the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.160 
parts for but the motor speeds and the
volume<00:02:55.299> within<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.630> drill<00:02:55.840> bits<00:02:56.019> and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
volume within the drill bits and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.449 
volume within the drill bits and
everything<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.530> already<00:02:56.769> been<00:02:56.920> tested<00:02:57.100> -

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
everything have already been tested -

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.350 
everything have already been tested -
these<00:02:57.610> work<00:02:59.250> the<00:03:00.250> flour<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.640> initially<00:03:01.030> had

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
these work the flour I initially had

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.809 
these work the flour I initially had
some<00:03:01.569> problems<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:01.989> -<00:03:02.319> until<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.709> found<00:03:03.010> just

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
some problems with - until I found just

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.780 
some problems with - until I found just
a<00:03:04.000> small<00:03:04.269> sifter<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.930> could<00:03:05.140> put<00:03:05.319> in<00:03:05.440> my

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a small sifter that I could put in my

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.059 
a small sifter that I could put in my
carousel<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.410> really<00:03:08.620> slow

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
carousel like this so it's a really slow

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.880 
carousel like this so it's a really slow
motor<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.790> high<00:03:10.120> gear<00:03:10.450> ratio<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.349> just<00:03:11.680> turns

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
motor the high gear ratio it just turns

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.680 
motor the high gear ratio it just turns
the<00:03:12.010> sifter<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> dispenses<00:03:13.630> a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
the sifter and it dispenses a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.380 
the sifter and it dispenses a
surprisingly<00:03:14.670> consistent<00:03:15.670> amount<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.120> flour

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
surprisingly consistent amount of flour

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.160 
surprisingly consistent amount of flour
per<00:03:17.010> revolution<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> sifter<00:03:19.049> this<00:03:20.049> will

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
per revolution of the sifter this will

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.069 
per revolution of the sifter this will
be<00:03:20.290> for<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> eggs<00:03:21.510> someone<00:03:22.510> asked<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.959> was

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
be for the eggs someone asked if I was

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.140 
be for the eggs someone asked if I was
going<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:23.470> egg<00:03:23.739> yolks<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.280> egg<00:03:24.820> whites

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
going to do egg yolks and egg whites

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.960 
going to do egg yolks and egg whites
separately<00:03:25.810> no<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:26.769> that's<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:27.010> good<00:03:27.130> idea<00:03:27.190> in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
separately no but that's a good idea in

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.250 
separately no but that's a good idea in
this<00:03:28.120> case<00:03:28.329> what<00:03:28.510> I'm<00:03:28.570> going<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:29.019> just

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
this case what I'm going to do is just

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.199 
this case what I'm going to do is just
beat<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.950> eggs<00:03:30.130> together<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:30.880> put<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
beat the eggs together and put the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.319 
beat the eggs together and put the
blended<00:03:31.600> eggs<00:03:31.780> into<00:03:32.049> this<00:03:32.290> syringe

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
blended eggs into this syringe

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.670 
blended eggs into this syringe
dispensing<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.780> liquids<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.260> super<00:03:35.650> easy

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
dispensing the liquids is super easy

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.509 
dispensing the liquids is super easy
compared<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:37.239> powders<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.519> brown

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
compared to the powders and the brown

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.059 
compared to the powders and the brown
sugar<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:39.910> all<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.299> stuff<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.769> will<00:03:41.950> be

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
sugar and all that stuff this will be

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.520 
sugar and all that stuff this will be
for<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> vanilla<00:03:42.489> extract

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
for the vanilla extract

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.379 
for the vanilla extract
Sam<00:03:44.530> deals<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.010> eggs<00:03:45.160> pretty<00:03:45.459> much<00:03:45.639> this<00:03:46.209> will

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
Sam deals the eggs pretty much this will

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.629 
Sam deals the eggs pretty much this will
be<00:03:46.510> for<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> butter<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.950> reason<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.280> using<00:03:48.459> a

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
be for the butter the reason I'm using a

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.150 
be for the butter the reason I'm using a
metal<00:03:48.760> syringe<00:03:49.500> for<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.590> butter<00:03:50.799> with<00:03:51.040> this

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
metal syringe for the butter with this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.920 
metal syringe for the butter with this
other<00:03:51.370> apparatus<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.840> be

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
other apparatus is that it has to be

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.289 
other apparatus is that it has to be
temperature<00:03:53.380> controlled<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.970> also<00:03:55.090> is

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
temperature controlled and it also is

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.729 
temperature controlled and it also is
going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.569> be<00:03:55.630> experiencing<00:03:56.230> much<00:03:56.440> higher

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
going to be experiencing much higher

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.970 
going to be experiencing much higher
pressures<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.030> syringe<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.680> metal

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
pressures in the syringe so this metal

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.890 
pressures in the syringe so this metal
syringe<00:04:00.430> was<00:04:00.639> needed<00:04:01.180> because<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.510> didn't<00:04:01.720> want

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
syringe was needed because I didn't want

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.750 
syringe was needed because I didn't want
the<00:04:02.049> glass<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.980> break<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.250> leaves<00:04:06.400> two

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
the glass to break so that leaves two

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.270 
the glass to break so that leaves two
unpopulated<00:04:07.510> stations<00:04:08.079> here<00:04:08.350> one<00:04:08.889> of<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.160> is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
unpopulated stations here one of them is

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.150 
unpopulated stations here one of them is
going<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.549> be<00:04:09.730> for<00:04:09.970> baking<00:04:10.359> soda<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
going to be for baking soda and the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.129 
going to be for baking soda and the
other<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.209> for<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> mixer<00:04:13.840> which<00:04:14.019> I

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
other is going to be for a mixer which I

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.750 
other is going to be for a mixer which I
may<00:04:14.319> or<00:04:14.440> may<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:14.590> implement<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:15.489> first

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
may or may not implement in this first

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.029 
may or may not implement in this first
version<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> idea<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.560> carousel

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
version so the idea is that the carousel

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.580 
version so the idea is that the carousel
would<00:04:18.220> turn<00:04:18.430> around<00:04:18.959> dispense<00:04:19.959> an<00:04:20.109> ingredient

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
would turn around dispense an ingredient

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.279 
would turn around dispense an ingredient
on<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.739> scale<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.489> know<00:04:22.240> turn<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> next

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
on the scale you know turn to the next

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.960 
on the scale you know turn to the next
station<00:04:23.530> dispense<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.159> ingredient<00:04:24.849> and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
station dispense that ingredient and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120 
station dispense that ingredient and
then<00:04:25.360> turn<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.750> mixer<00:04:26.140> station<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.770> mixer

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
then turn to the mixer station the mixer

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.710 
then turn to the mixer station the mixer
station<00:04:27.520> would<00:04:27.610> actually<00:04:27.940> go<00:04:28.120> down<00:04:28.300> into<00:04:28.540> the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
station would actually go down into the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.660 
station would actually go down into the
into<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> cup<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:29.980> mix<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> ingredients

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
into the cup and mix the ingredients

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.120 
into the cup and mix the ingredients
together<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.600> think<00:04:32.350> for<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.590> first<00:04:32.830> shot

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
together I think for this first shot

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.670 
together I think for this first shot
what<00:04:33.310> I'll<00:04:33.430> do<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.790> just<00:04:34.170> you<00:04:35.170> know<00:04:35.290> have<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
what I'll do is just you know have the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.100 
what I'll do is just you know have the
thing<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.890> little<00:04:36.040> bit<00:04:36.250> more<00:04:36.430> user<00:04:37.390> involvement

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
thing a little bit more user involvement

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.510 
thing a little bit more user involvement
so<00:04:38.260> it'll<00:04:38.470> dispense<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.950> ingredients<00:04:39.460> and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so it'll dispense the ingredients and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.340 
so it'll dispense the ingredients and
then<00:04:39.640> say<00:04:39.910> okay<00:04:40.240> mix<00:04:40.510> those<00:04:40.720> together<00:04:40.930> and

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
then say okay mix those together and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.950 
then say okay mix those together and
then<00:04:41.860> dispense<00:04:42.160> three<00:04:43.150> more<00:04:43.360> ingredients<00:04:43.870> and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
then dispense three more ingredients and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.200 
then dispense three more ingredients and
say<00:04:44.080> okay<00:04:44.380> mix<00:04:44.620> those<00:04:44.800> together<00:04:45.040> or<00:04:45.790> something

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
say okay mix those together or something

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.180 
say okay mix those together or something
but<00:04:46.420> I'll<00:04:46.960> see<00:04:47.320> how<00:04:47.440> much<00:04:47.500> time<00:04:47.890> I<00:04:47.920> have<00:04:50.190> I've

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
but I'll see how much time I have I've

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.800 
but I'll see how much time I have I've
been<00:04:51.490> working<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.880> bit<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.270> firmware<00:04:52.540> in

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
been working a bit on the firmware in

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.930 
been working a bit on the firmware in
the<00:04:52.930> UI<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:54.100> think<00:04:54.310> I'm<00:04:54.430> going<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.760> use

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
the UI and I think I'm going to use

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.240 
the UI and I think I'm going to use
processing<00:04:55.600> org<00:04:56.020> for<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.410> UI<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:57.010> because

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
processing org for the UI just because

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.470 
processing org for the UI just because
it's<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.580> quick<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.000> easy

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
it's so quick and easy

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.170 
it's so quick and easy
I've<00:04:58.840> already<00:04:59.020> got<00:04:59.290> a<00:04:59.320> simple<00:05:00.100> GUI<00:05:00.340> over<00:05:00.850> there

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
I've already got a simple GUI over there

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.750 
I've already got a simple GUI over there
and<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.900> put<00:05:02.200> some<00:05:02.800> pressure<00:05:03.010> on<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.400> scale

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
and if I put some pressure on the scale

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.850 
and if I put some pressure on the scale
you<00:05:04.090> can<00:05:04.900> see<00:05:05.080> it's<00:05:05.230> already<00:05:05.470> feeding<00:05:05.650> the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you can see it's already feeding the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.740 
you can see it's already feeding the
values<00:05:06.220> through<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.820> serial<00:05:07.180> port<00:05:07.360> into<00:05:07.630> the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
values through the serial port into the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.720 
values through the serial port into the
computer<00:05:08.170> there<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:09.220> I'm<00:05:09.310> going<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> come<00:05:09.640> up

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
computer there so I'm going to come up

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.850 
computer there so I'm going to come up
with<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.880> simple<00:05:10.360> packetized<00:05:10.990> serial<00:05:11.380> protocol

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
with a simple packetized serial protocol

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.710 
with a simple packetized serial protocol
and<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.730> computer<00:05:13.120> will<00:05:13.270> basically<00:05:13.420> be

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
and the computer will basically be

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.750 
and the computer will basically be
driving<00:05:14.340> microcontroller<00:05:15.340> it'll<00:05:15.610> send

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
driving microcontroller it'll send

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.300 
driving microcontroller it'll send
commands<00:05:16.210> like<00:05:16.480> you<00:05:16.660> know<00:05:17.040> dispense<00:05:18.040> five

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
commands like you know dispense five

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.040 
commands like you know dispense five
grams<00:05:18.670> of<00:05:18.880> flour<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.510> then<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
grams of flour and then the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.540 
grams of flour and then the
microcontroller<00:05:20.500> will<00:05:20.890> handle<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.340> loop

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
microcontroller will handle the loop

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.580 
microcontroller will handle the loop
between<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.660> motor<00:05:22.900> drive<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:23.500> the

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
between the the motor drive and the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.920 
between the the motor drive and the
scale<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.190> then<00:05:24.610> send<00:05:24.910> back<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.240> okay<00:05:25.660> and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
scale and then send back in okay and

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.750 
scale and then send back in okay and
probably<00:05:26.890> what<00:05:27.010> will<00:05:27.100> happen<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.670> know

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
probably what will happen is you know

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.910 
probably what will happen is you know
the<00:05:27.880> target<00:05:28.090> value<00:05:28.540> will<00:05:28.720> be<00:05:28.870> five<00:05:29.530> point<00:05:29.830> zero

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
the target value will be five point zero

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.460 
the target value will be five point zero
zero<00:05:30.220> grams<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.120> it'll<00:05:31.300> actually<00:05:31.450> get<00:05:31.840> five

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
zero grams and it'll actually get five

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.890 
zero grams and it'll actually get five
point<00:05:32.950> zero<00:05:33.670> five<00:05:33.970> or<00:05:34.240> whatever<00:05:34.510> end<00:05:34.780> up

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
point zero five or whatever end up

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.010 
point zero five or whatever end up
getting<00:05:35.230> and<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.550> microprocessor<00:05:37.510> can

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
getting and so the microprocessor can

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.500 
getting and so the microprocessor can
connect<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.710> send<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.490> actual<00:05:39.820> value<00:05:40.300> back

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
connect and send the actual value back

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.150 
connect and send the actual value back
to<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.660> GUI<00:05:42.840> so<00:05:43.840> all<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.290> stations<00:05:44.710> here<00:05:44.920> have

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
to the GUI so all the stations here have

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.760 
to the GUI so all the stations here have
been<00:05:45.310> tested<00:05:45.850> except<00:05:46.720> for<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.170> brown<00:05:47.350> sugar

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
been tested except for the brown sugar

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.920 
been tested except for the brown sugar
and<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.550> chocolate<00:05:48.910> chips<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.600> baking

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
and the chocolate chips and the baking

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.960 
and the chocolate chips and the baking
soda<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.950> once<00:05:51.100> I<00:05:51.220> get<00:05:51.370> those<00:05:51.520> straightened

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
soda so once I get those straightened

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.370 
soda so once I get those straightened
out<00:05:52.030> I'll<00:05:52.210> be<00:05:52.240> fairly<00:05:52.570> confident<00:05:53.110> that<00:05:53.230> I<00:05:53.290> can

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
out I'll be fairly confident that I can

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.040 
out I'll be fairly confident that I can
dispense<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.360> about<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.810> right<00:05:55.990> amount

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
dispense you know about the right amount

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.860 
dispense you know about the right amount
of<00:05:56.560> each<00:05:56.680> material<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:58.090> do<00:05:58.300> that<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.630> a<00:05:58.690> fairly

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
of each material and do that in a fairly

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.300 
of each material and do that in a fairly
controlled<00:05:59.350> manner<00:05:59.650> you<00:05:59.890> know<00:06:00.010> with<00:06:00.220> the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
controlled manner you know with the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.800 
controlled manner you know with the
computer<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:00.730> all<00:06:00.850> that<00:06:01.030> stuff<00:06:01.270> working<00:06:01.540> I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
computer and all that stuff working I

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.430 
computer and all that stuff working I
think<00:06:02.170> that'll<00:06:02.440> be<00:06:02.530> just<00:06:02.560> fine<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:04.030> major

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
think that'll be just fine the major

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.750 
think that'll be just fine the major
uncertainties<00:06:05.440> left<00:06:05.740> are<00:06:05.950> the<00:06:06.040> mixing<00:06:06.460> like<00:06:06.640> I

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
uncertainties left are the mixing like I

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.410 
uncertainties left are the mixing like I
say<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.150> might<00:06:07.330> be<00:06:07.360> done<00:06:07.630> by<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:07.840> human<00:06:08.170> and<00:06:09.420> the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
say it might be done by a human and the

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.710 
say it might be done by a human and the
mechanics<00:06:10.900> involved<00:06:11.170> with<00:06:11.530> with<00:06:11.890> moving<00:06:12.400> this

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
mechanics involved with with moving this

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.740 
mechanics involved with with moving this
carousel<00:06:13.720> around<00:06:14.260> I'm<00:06:15.030> planning<00:06:16.030> to<00:06:16.060> attach<00:06:16.510> a

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
carousel around I'm planning to attach a

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.400 
carousel around I'm planning to attach a
grey<00:06:16.990> code<00:06:17.290> to<00:06:18.070> the<00:06:18.220> side<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.670> this<00:06:19.410> white

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
grey code to the side of this white

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.450 
grey code to the side of this white
Delrin<00:06:20.920> collar<00:06:21.190> here<00:06:21.640> and<00:06:21.820> then<00:06:22.330> put<00:06:22.630> a

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
Delrin collar here and then put a

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.770 
Delrin collar here and then put a
four-channel<00:06:24.460> optical<00:06:24.880> reader<00:06:25.120> on<00:06:25.390> there<00:06:25.600> and

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
four-channel optical reader on there and

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.930 
four-channel optical reader on there and
then<00:06:26.290> drive<00:06:26.530> this<00:06:26.710> around<00:06:27.040> with<00:06:27.160> just<00:06:27.400> a<00:06:27.490> DC

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
then drive this around with just a DC

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.210 
then drive this around with just a DC
motor<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.480> implement<00:06:29.200> another<00:06:29.500> servo<00:06:29.980> loop

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
motor and implement another servo loop

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
motor and implement another servo loop
in<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.460> microcontroller<00:06:30.940> I<00:06:33.060> don't<00:06:34.060> think

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
in the microcontroller I don't think

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.030 
in the microcontroller I don't think
that'll<00:06:34.510> be<00:06:34.540> too<00:06:34.990> hard<00:06:35.350> I<00:06:35.590> think<00:06:35.650> that'll

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
that'll be too hard I think that'll

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.920 
that'll be too hard I think that'll
actually<00:06:36.220> work<00:06:36.520> out<00:06:36.669> fine<00:06:36.970> and<00:06:37.180> seeing<00:06:37.810> this

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
actually work out fine and seeing this

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.500 
actually work out fine and seeing this
thing<00:06:38.110> whip<00:06:38.290> around<00:06:38.470> automatically<00:06:39.280> will<00:06:39.460> be

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
thing whip around automatically will be

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:46.860 
thing whip around automatically will be
impressive<00:06:42.240> okay<00:06:43.240> see<00:06:43.690> you<00:06:43.840> next<00:06:44.050> time<00:06:44.200> back
