00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.490
 a fresh scout who trailed by 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.040
 spring and 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.260
 well , in summer 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.260
 Yes, we need the head itself board 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 so little miracle 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:33.309
 meant top unscrew this school 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.920
 yes the drug is so starting we start what 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.480
 there is no necessarily black in this 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.720
 internal slightly from the head 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.470
 fix we leave bends black exactly 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:53.700
 because when wet black thread 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.580
 gives your color 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:03.900
 contrast well yes it becomes 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:06.090
 clear water and soaked some 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.870
 news you like guts out there inside 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 there is a feeling I will say fresh 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.310
 such an average horse on the boilers it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 there is a fix fixed at about 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 top and holding large moves 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 go to the ringlet watch head 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.160
 Yes, we already here more ksir already 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.700
 lead back fix this step to take 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.100
 approximately evenly and the body can already 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.670
 even changes us to kittens all villi 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.270
 snuggled up 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.299
 so you get that you can 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.420
 leave a long tail but not principle 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.549
 recommended if this hook is small 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.560
 cut off here is the same puts as. so and 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.549
 it turns out better of course to use 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:03.149
 red well and the head is orange us 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.149
 We put everything we take Dalnik 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.440
 even here the junction becomes 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:16.069
 translucent because the fly is small 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.069
 impose a little bit 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.680
 here it is hastily evenly it turned out 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.470
 here you can also add 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:04.000
 a little bit 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:08.680
 glamor and the water does not compress much brush 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.960
 houses from which it was immediately and when we put 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.600
 his task is to wash him quickly but we 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.850
 to do what you need at a fish 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.970
 will determine all the affairs that had which stick out 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.700
 here if and of course you can trim 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.580
 cut in principle how would that is in 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.580
 measure here and so let's say all remained 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.510
 just simple 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.090
 it's like a working thing as if the same reef 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.940
 it took off just for a little more 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:50.780
 hooked 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:53.240
 again, cut off well and what is it 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.920
 scout the size of him sit down but 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.520
 initially developing that could 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.520
 to catch 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.010
 that is, here is such a bunch that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.810
 should the fireplace not be seen that is it 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.810
 of working variations
