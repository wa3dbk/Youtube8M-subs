we're<00:00:57.890> looking<00:00:58.190> at<00:00:58.280> here<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.579> just<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:59.030> tablet

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
we're looking at here is just a tablet

we're looking at here is just a tablet
minigame<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.590> is<00:01:00.710> mostly<00:01:01.010> detached<00:01:01.489> from

the<00:01:02.090> ground<00:01:02.329> zeroes<00:01:02.660> experience<00:01:03.289> rather<00:01:03.859> than

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
the ground zeroes experience rather than

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.310 
the ground zeroes experience rather than
a<00:01:04.220> companion<00:01:04.759> app<00:01:04.910> that<00:01:05.089> enhances<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.780> the

a companion app that enhances it the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960 
a companion app that enhances it the
reason<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:06.710> say<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.130> because<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.789> look

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
reason I say this is because if you look

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.730 
reason I say this is because if you look
at<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.149> top<00:01:08.390> left<00:01:08.660> corner<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.380> app<00:01:09.500> is

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
at the top left corner the app is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.770 
at the top left corner the app is
labeled<00:01:10.100> mother<00:01:10.520> base<00:01:10.789> game<00:01:11.180> rather<00:01:11.600> than

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
labeled mother base game rather than

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.600 
labeled mother base game rather than
something<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.350> mother<00:01:12.830> bastes<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.220> poor

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
something like mother bastes a poor

makes<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.039> sound<00:01:16.160> as<00:01:16.340> if<00:01:16.369> what<00:01:16.700> we're<00:01:16.849> looking

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179
