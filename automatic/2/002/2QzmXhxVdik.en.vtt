00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 that there are boys and girls talking to them 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.359
 kaiser we are in a video more of encouragement 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 from here and here to vary this with 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.340
 red arquette to the refugee rice berola 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.110
 or the saucepan and what and today 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 we are in a video more information 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 of halo 4 the date and as you will know 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.140
 in hello information videos 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 4 the date we normally do not 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.390
 we talk a lot about the gameplay and with no 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 To talk a lot 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.960
 we do not talk almost anything in reality and what 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 only thing we're going to say today about this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.380
 gameplay is that you are playing red play 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.300
 for this one so they know who the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 point of view we are when two against 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 two referred to vary and I do not go out 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.559
 because I'm really embarrassed because 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.390
 I played this game quite badly and we're going 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 quickly to the first piece of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 halo information 4 that this week in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 truth is little but it is enough 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 quite important is well well good 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.329
 and there's a lot to see and I'm not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.949
 wrong with listening because they are 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 listening to them and they will not see also 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.090
 this information they have but already go 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.500
 You will see later to see Robert 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.080
 the first info details of the queen what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.060
 fuck is the queen in pink good 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 as you already know how to do in several 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.450
 games and it's a kind of weapons and a half 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.670
 peculiar but always characterized by 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 If so pretty powerful I have not 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 seen for example in metal gear up to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.960
 I've seen in movies like in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.180
 Transformers I do not know if you guys will know 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.670
 which one I mean but more or less idea 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.680
 medium and an idea of ​​how that will be 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 weapon and in fact it's going to be pretty 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.960
 powerful and from what I read it seems 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.290
 to be as good is going to be better said 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 like a smooth spartan or spartan rifle 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 but not a Spartan laser but for 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.780
 this is not going to have zoom and mode 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 shoot as you will already know the laser 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 Spartan shot but required a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.340
 some time before launching that super 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.830
 ultra red ray good for this is going to be 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.869
 half the time and as for the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.570
 vehicles will not have unfortunately 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.300
 the damage so high that the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.400
 spartan laser lasers exported as 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.290
 you want to say it I think it's 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.060
 true is not right or is it not so 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.890
 regrettable that not that it does not go down so much 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.679
 vehicles because the laser sparta 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.720
 that is the vehicle was lowered from one to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.530
 unless the tanks were lowered from 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 but the bad thing was that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.490
 it took a lot to load 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.500
 you had to wait for a while and 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.959
 when he had loaded the low ponte 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.540
 vehicle imagine a weapon that loads the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.790
 double fast and get off vehicles like this 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.220
 12 would be recontra opc already very over power 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 for me in my opinion and see I do not know there's a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.569
 balance between the recharge that is half 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.969
 is providing the arranz so 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.040
 really the power he has against the 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.709
 characters we do not know exactly which 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.329
 it's but we 'll see we 'll see more 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.489
 ahead how will it be to see if it's in 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.890
 actually a powerweb really puts it that way 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.620
 as with all its letters the following 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.170
 piece of information is about the skins of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.180
 the armor that eyes we have to 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.430
 differentiate them the pieces of armors 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.680
 which are the different types of armor 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.420
 what do you wear on the spartan and skins 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.470
 which are the type of paint that goes over 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.050
 of armor 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.430
 the information is half sad because it 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.280
 refers to that there will be different 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.470
 skins that will give you depending on the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.090
 where preorders the game does not 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.040
 we know what the fuck is you got 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.020
 buy me as 4 games for the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.550
 different sites but ordered for 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.900
 to be able to have all the skins I hope that 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.100
 I do not expect them to come out later and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 give to everyone, which had 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.400
 a lot but good this one between these 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.560
 stores will be and big game bestbuy 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 play.com and amazon.com I even think that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.240
 also microsoft is going to have its own 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.770
 skin but that we do not have the image 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.180
 if you want to see images of these skins 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.220
 they are down here in the description 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.050
 thanks to skilful Sebastian and once again 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.880
 for having passed this piece to us 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.290
 information that is this incredible and the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.730
 next but it's information that 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.780
 he is also very good and robert is going to 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.730
 tell 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.140
 well at the beginning we said that we were going to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 see you here you were going to see 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.490
 in visual information with eyes 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.140
 with the eyes obviously being visual with 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.850
 the eyes and it's because there's a gameplay 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.340
 filtering I do not know what the hell they have 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.110
 made for this upload it to youtube because 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.460
 it's really on youtube the bad thing is that 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.130
 it does not look very good and it's engraved 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.590
 television and it's really a quality 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.670
 horrible place really really 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.440
 is recorded by an addict to the 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.760
 masturbation because the egg in the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.260
 camera moves from top to bottom 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.870
 up and down good the link is also 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.740
 in the description and this one quickly and 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.000
 the tooth is about to end it 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.100
 it looks like it's recorded with a cell phone 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.480
 the camera is horrible but the timbre 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.060
 truth seems legitimate and has not 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.680
 confirmed nothing that not and I hope not 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.200
 remove it for when we have raised the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.420
 video because if it's not going to be regrettable 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.240
 they have to see how is this this 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.740
 gameplay is pretty good and but it's either 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 it is seen that halo is seen completely 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.160
 halo but it looks different than what we have 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.650
 seen in halo 2 that the three up 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.900
 even halo reach and one robert and between 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.090
 the things that you see in the video you that 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.580
 could you see there robert in the video 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.889
 this of this gameplay what we talk to 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.169
 principle we can see the rule we could 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.150
 see a few murders in fact 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.120
 we could see a take a little bit more of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.639
 luck in action of the br even though it looked 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.220
 horrible clear by resolution and 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.660
 rocker launcher also and another of the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.190
 skills that we had mentioned in 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.320
 another video that is the one of the biggest formal 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.870
 clear vision the vision four runner that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.460
 it is this power to see through the 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.900
 walls that we said how 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.460
 fuck you will be able to see through the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.160
 walls without this being very over power 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.169
 what we 've seen this is used 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.870
 just a little while I do not know if it's that 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.840
 truth that has been playing used it 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.160
 just a little while or really it's very 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.960
 short the time in which you can see 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.729
 through the walls but good the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.100
 brother this saw through the walls 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.139
 and who could identify through 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.970
 a wall and then frame him and 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.830
 I always knew where this compadre was 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.220
 you have to see the gameplay for 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.690
 that they see exactly how it is but 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.860
 We need more details because in 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.530
 reality may may end up being 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.060
 pretty v-power and quickly with other 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.129
 things we could see that this one is 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.709
 gameplay of the gun 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:07.389
 of weapons like the one we said is no longer 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.959
 actually as we thought they were falling 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:13.059
 the weapons of clear order is not the 

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:15.249
 ordinance but actually appears the 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.349
 weapon half rare and with a light so 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.959
 they have to see it and what seems to be a 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:22.239
 shield wall so similar to those of 

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:24.789
 halo 3 like the ones on maps like 

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:26.589
 for example snow bound I do not know if I do not know if 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.199
 they remember that there were shield walls 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.509
 or shield doors better said they were 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.369
 shit because this incited the 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.869
 I win in a way you can not imagine 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.189
 and that in the end is what you are and 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:38.949
 they had to remove them and totally 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.209
 good this and that's all that's all the 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.879
 information that we have so far is 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:45.159
 little but how can you know how they can 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.169
 have realized it 's pretty good already 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.699
 know the links of everything is here in the 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.249
