 the British plan to create a huge database to spy on 

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:36.300
 phone calls text messages or email and the vexation is 

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:40.780
 by the network of citizens with the excuse of terrorism insist that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.039
 the communications must be from the police domain so that the 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.079
 operators will have to keep all the data for at least 12 months 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.370
 but it's not all lost today that the records should come out 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 people approved by a judge

 the evil that they have had the detail anyway this is the beginning of the 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.710
 end of privacy because your plan is for the government to keep all the data 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.579
 that before the providers of the services do 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.539
 the critics to the denouncing project a society of total vigilance and 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.829

 planting smoke without abandoning the state of terror I tell you that his father 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.450

 dangerous elements like anthrax a flashlight a whistle wet handkerchiefs and 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 a small lever to break windows 10 that peliculero are the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.590

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.340
 June and we will have it throughout Spain the next day the best of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.190
 everything is that the most anticipated phone price will not be fixed since they will be 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.040
 within the business strategy of the telephone company 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.819
 which on the other hand down in a bit 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.280
 and so that the team does not feel at home the flagship store of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.759
 Telephone located in madrid on calle gran via 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.780
 It will be the closest thing to a fight store in Spain 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 aesthetics and distribution will be similar as the philosophy of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.349
 test the products solve our doubts insa the wi-fi 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.389
 finally on June 18 yesterday 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.069
 while the injured are 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.469
 there was this is very strong it turns out that they arrive well they still sky the designer of 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.959
 yves aubourg the epic games game for the microsoft console 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.179
 women I can not for less 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.489
 al arabi fairy or something like that goes well 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.099
 decided that the second part of the popular game for the x box 13 70 for 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.950
 include elements that attract a wider audience to the ninth with the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.200
 modifications 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.489
 will suppress the huge tits of the female characters and in the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.980
 as much as possible the stereotyped characters but this does not end here 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.959
 the monkeys kill at the time of nothing painted by levels of difficulty 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.790
 depending on the person who is playing before I continue I have the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.159
 need to tell him that stereotyped this 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.069
 let's continue the game will have a more human and credible story and for this 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.180
 character of unpronounceable surname this translates into the character of 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.989
 Annie be stronger but also very motherly with delta squad men 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.889
 so I do not know if I would give the breast to the insane 4 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.109
 but what is clear is that those who visited decades ago in the face to 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.589
 To broaden section so that it is as it is clear that this designer does not have 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:06.299
 no idea what women think and fear gives me to load the game 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.219
 in the attempt we will know in November the month of its launch a cold meat 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:15.579
