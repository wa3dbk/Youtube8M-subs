00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750 
here I went ahead and just cut it it's
free<00:02:55.080> easy<00:02:55.290> fix<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.740> before<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> cut<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.700> I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
free easy fix but I before I cut it I

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.070 
free easy fix but I before I cut it I
made<00:02:56.940> sure<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.120> turn<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.420> key<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.600> we<00:02:57.870> still

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
made sure I turn the key on we still

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.980 
made sure I turn the key on we still
have<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.320> pressure<00:02:58.590> drop<00:02:59.540> with<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.570> fuel

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
have that pressure drop with the fuel

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.290 
have that pressure drop with the fuel
pressure<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:02.430> after<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.270> cut<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> wire

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.080 

like<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.590> now<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> fuel<00:03:08.520> pump<00:03:08.700> turns<00:03:08.910> on

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
like this and now the fuel pump turns on

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.350 
like this and now the fuel pump turns on
there<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.200> no<00:03:10.550> injector<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:12.000> fuel<00:03:12.210> pressure

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
there is no injector for a fuel pressure

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.380 
there is no injector for a fuel pressure
drop<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.320> real<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.490> have<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> stuck<00:03:15.120> driver

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
drop in a real so we have a stuck driver

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.050 
drop in a real so we have a stuck driver
a<00:03:15.540> PCM
