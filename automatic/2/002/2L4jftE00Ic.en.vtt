00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
* If you haven't watched the earlier episodes, this will make no sense

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.760
I will give back-up for 30 more seconds

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.530
How hardworking...

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.930
Godspeed
Got it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.870
Be a good girl and come back, Udonge

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.010
*maebari*

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.110
*crack*

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.510
"No matter how hard you try, you can't reach her, can't save her, can't help her!!"

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.790
"That was luck"

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.260
*kupa*

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.560
I can control a thousand arrows at once

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.570
Udonge, will you be able to see through them?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.200
*whoosh*

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.270
POM

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.710
Whaaaat!?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.720
Just a bit more

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.690
What a surprise...

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.530
You've become strong, Udonge

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.570
Of course

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.170
...I'm your apprentice

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.980
"Eientei"

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860
Goal... *pant pant*

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.160
*pant pant*
"Eientei"

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.760
*pant pant*
I never would have made it without her

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.130
"Ei--tewi"

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
Um, well

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.140
you know

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.570
Th-Thanks, Reisen!!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.870
Heburai!!

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.440
Huh? Was I dead?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.440
Oh, Tewi. You came back alone?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.450
Ohh!?

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.250
Wait, did you come just to bring me these!?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.250
Tewi

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.990
Thanks

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.360
D...

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.860
Don't worry about it...

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.360
...actually

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.600
*squish*
Like I was gonna fall for that again, you idiot!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.840
What happened, Tewi?
Let her be

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.320
"Yuukarin Farm"

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.330
Uho! This is paradise!!

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Let's play watermelon splitting
What?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.110
"Just Princess Watching"

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.150
Say no.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.490
Agh...

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.490
I guess I'll have to

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.030
That's right, Eirin once taught me how to make rice

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.030
I'll try to remember about that time

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.400
Let's see, first thing...

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.400
I put just the rice in the hearth

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.700
Obu!!
No!!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.170
Ohhhhh...

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.140
What was that for...

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.040
Who are you?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.260
I'm a mysterious super beautiful woman cook!!

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
Beautiful?

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.560
Then why do you have a mask on? *spurt*

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.770
Face doesn't matter for cooking!!

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.640
All right, I'll teach you how to cook rice
(Yeah right, I'm not learning from YOU!)

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.540
Excuse me, teacher

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.540
What is it? *blush*

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.580
I first wanna see your amazing skill~

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.290
A-All right, watch close
(I got you, idiot!!)

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.290
(This is payback for earlier)

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.060
(I'll get you once behind the head!!)

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.270
All right, I'm washing the rice. The way you do it is--

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.280
Wait, I'll do it!!

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.120
I'm sure Princess will start to make an effort now

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.320
*pull*

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.330
Yeah, let's leave them alone for a while

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.370
Uwaraba!!
You weren't on guard, you idiot!!

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.430
...thanks
H-Hey! Let me out! Don't leave me!!

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.780
"2am"

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.980
No more...rabbit testing...

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.920
*spin*

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.460
No running away, Tewi

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.700
*flinch*
That's right~

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.700
Come on, Tewi, you're so shy

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.700
I put in a lot of effort to make this for you♪

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.770
(You're not getting out of this, Tewi...)

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.780
Kufufufufufufu
(Oh crap, this is really bad!!)

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.180
(But Reisen...Reisen will help me somehow...!!)

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.850
Horry ho hay (Sorry, no way)

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.290
Eat it in one go♪

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.590
Yay♪
(I take it back)

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.320
You should just sleep and not do anything!!

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:37.900
From all of us at Eientei
Thank you for watching until the end
