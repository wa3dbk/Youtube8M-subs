process of actually using mounts in
wallets<00:00:18.580> Audrina<00:00:18.880> as<00:00:19.090> you<00:00:19.240> know<00:00:19.480> you<00:00:19.539> can<00:00:19.930> only

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
wallets Audrina as you know you can only

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.620 
wallets Audrina as you know you can only
use<00:00:20.289> ground<00:00:20.830> mounts<00:00:21.190> in<00:00:21.340> Draenor<00:00:21.880> which<00:00:22.330> means

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
use ground mounts in Draenor which means

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.090 
use ground mounts in Draenor which means
they're<00:00:22.840> going<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.050> be<00:00:23.140> making<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.619> majority

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
they're going to be making the majority

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.670 
they're going to be making the majority
if<00:00:24.250> not<00:00:24.310> all<00:00:24.460> mounts<00:00:25.210> like<00:00:25.869> flying<00:00:26.140> mounts

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
if not all mounts like flying mounts

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.590 
if not all mounts like flying mounts
that<00:00:26.740> could<00:00:27.039> usually<00:00:27.340> only<00:00:27.760> be<00:00:28.060> flying<00:00:28.359> Matt's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
that could usually only be flying Matt's

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.109 
that could usually only be flying Matt's
actually<00:00:28.840> be<00:00:29.650> usable<00:00:30.039> as<00:00:30.130> grauman's<00:00:30.640> now

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
actually be usable as grauman's now

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.819 
actually be usable as grauman's now
that's<00:00:31.330> not<00:00:31.510> currently<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:32.079> for<00:00:32.259> testing<00:00:32.649> but

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
that's not currently in for testing but

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.770 
that's not currently in for testing but
what<00:00:33.039> there<00:00:33.219> is<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.639> the<00:00:33.879> favourite<00:00:34.420> system

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
what there is is the favourite system

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.139 
what there is is the favourite system
and<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.350> summon<00:00:35.710> random<00:00:36.219> amount<00:00:36.729> button

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
and the summon random amount button

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.789 
and the summon random amount button
which<00:00:37.389> is<00:00:37.569> at<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.719> top<00:00:37.989> right<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.499> so<00:00:38.710> we

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:38.799 
which is at the top right there so we

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.379 
which is at the top right there so we
can<00:00:38.979> right<00:00:39.489> click<00:00:39.519> on<00:00:39.909> in<00:00:40.030> one<00:00:40.179> of<00:00:40.299> our

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:40.389 
can right click on in one of our

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:42.029 
can right click on in one of our
favorite<00:00:40.780> mounts<00:00:41.049> and<00:00:41.199> add<00:00:41.319> it<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.649> list<00:00:41.889> of

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
favorite mounts and add it to a list of

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.029 
favorite mounts and add it to a list of
favorites<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.639> this<00:00:43.149> will<00:00:43.409> actually<00:00:44.409> summon

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
favorites and this will actually summon

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.340 
favorites and this will actually summon
amount<00:00:45.459> random<00:00:46.120> from<00:00:46.719> that<00:00:46.929> list<00:00:47.139> of

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
amount random from that list of

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.259 
amount random from that list of
favorites<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.039> which<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:48.789> can<00:00:48.969> put<00:00:49.149> on<00:00:49.239> your

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
favorites and which you can put on your

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.599 
favorites and which you can put on your
hotkeys<00:00:49.719> here<00:00:49.989> or<00:00:50.139> into<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.499> macro<00:00:50.979> there<00:00:51.459> are

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
hotkeys here or into a macro there are

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.309 
hotkeys here or into a macro there are
add-ons<00:00:51.819> and<00:00:52.149> things<00:00:52.389> like<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.659> for<00:00:53.109> this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
add-ons and things like that for this

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.680 
add-ons and things like that for this
already<00:00:53.769> but<00:00:54.339> this<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.639> kind<00:00:54.879> of<00:00:54.969> an<00:00:55.119> intuitive

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
already but this is kind of an intuitive

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.419 
already but this is kind of an intuitive
way<00:00:55.899> of<00:00:56.170> applying<00:00:56.679> that<00:00:56.979> to<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.219> blizzard

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
way of applying that to the blizzard

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.660 
way of applying that to the blizzard
user<00:00:57.879> interface<00:00:58.629> as<00:00:59.010> standard<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.369> that's<00:01:00.549> not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
user interface as standard so that's not

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.609 
user interface as standard so that's not
the<00:01:00.729> only<00:01:00.850> change<00:01:01.179> here<00:01:01.779> as<00:01:01.959> you<00:01:02.139> see<00:01:02.170> we've

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
the only change here as you see we've

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.469 
the only change here as you see we've
got<00:01:02.649> your<00:01:02.889> pet<00:01:03.159> bar<00:01:03.369> and<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.670> second<00:01:04.030> tab<00:01:04.239> and

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479
