00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.369 
all we've seen with one bird of prey
probably<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> puzzle<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> doesn't

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:43.379 
probably a puzzle I think but it doesn't

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:44.570 
probably a puzzle I think but it doesn't
any<00:01:43.500> matter<00:01:43.709> what<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> was<00:01:44.099> it<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> bird<00:01:44.550> of

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
any matter what it was it was a bird of

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.729 
any matter what it was it was a bird of
prey<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.300> it's<00:01:45.599> certainly<00:01:45.929> one<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.289> turtle

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:46.739 
prey and it's certainly one the turtle

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.550 
prey and it's certainly one the turtle
dove<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.640> certainly<00:01:48.000> wasn't<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.599> choir<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
dove and it certainly wasn't a choir and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.430 
dove and it certainly wasn't a choir and
it<00:01:50.039> flew<00:01:50.369> across<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.330> horizon<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
it flew across the horizon there and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.130 
it flew across the horizon there and
immediately<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.429> appeared<00:01:53.910> there<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.929> gun

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
immediately it appeared there was a gun

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
immediately it appeared there was a gun
shot<00:01:55.410> only<00:01:55.709> one<00:01:56.009> shot<00:01:56.269> didn't<00:01:57.269> hit<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.479> well

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
shot only one shot didn't hit it well
