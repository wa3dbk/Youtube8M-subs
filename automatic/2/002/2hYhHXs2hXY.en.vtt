00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 I was hungry and me 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.310
 and what can I compare like this in those 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.480
 diego mods we report in a video more than 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.090
 GTA 5 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.279
 online hello friends this time 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.949
 I bring a new method of money 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.960
 infinite with the help of a friend and then 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.730
 well that click works only for 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 old generations should be stressed 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.530
 then good the requirements to do 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.589
 that click are very simple we will occupy a 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.989
 car of the street lying down to the maximum then 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.780
 to the maximum that we can , obviously if 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.269
 put him safe or locator too 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.769
 friends should be stressed without explosives and 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.900
 that I had been told in the old video 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.670
 that well then with all that we 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.250
 we can go to the front of our garage 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.559
 another requirement also extend so 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.720
 minus the help of a friend and be in 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.369
 an invitation session already when 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.739
 let's have everything as I said to the 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.140
 front of our garage we will look for a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.390
 wall similar to this one where we can 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.520
 park the vehicle in this way ok 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.740
 and then our friend will bring another 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.960
 vehicle and it will put it behind us 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.180
 in this way we will crash ok as 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.840
 making a sandwich type already after 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 that we will go to gt online 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.630
 and what is called activities being a condition 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.179
 of an activity missions created by 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.039
 rockstar ok here we will look for any 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.140
 mission here works with anyone 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.899
 but in this case I did it with the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.110
 lesson 2 and well then here 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.060
 we will simply start the game 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.039
 now it's just a matter of putting the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.259
 vehicle to our garage not as you can 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.090
 see here I already have other rejoinders but no 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.250
 matter I'm going to replace nothing else 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.439
 to click good here and our 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.989
 friend who stayed in the session is going to 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.399
 invite back that in the session 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.289
 obviously the friend who was 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.750
 helping and good here we will enter 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.579
 we will enter the session and good if it is 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 his friend then moved no matter what else 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.569
 once you go back to the way you were 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.729
 the vehicle is again in the 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.179
 Just as people again is 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 online to host an activity 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.760
 missions created by rockstar and we 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.879
 let's go to mission 2 and good 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.340
 here we start the mission again another 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.590
 Once the vehicle is put into the garage and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.080
 Well, how can the click be realized? 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.320
 it's super repetitive 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.600
 it's the same since the game go to the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.150
 mission put the vehicle that your friend 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 I invite you again and again the same 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.440
 process repeat it and repeat it and one 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
 Friends is English as I said 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.330
 works in any garage only 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.280
 it's a matter of finding a wall like that 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.460
 similar and have your friend park the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.290
 vehicle in the back ok and good 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.410
 as I tell you it 's eclipse is pretty 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.900
 repetitive so I'm going to cut part 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.300
 of the video since it would be very long 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.280
 and put everything not but partly as 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.310
 I tell them it's just a matter of doing what 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.320
 same again and again and that is the end 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.290
 no longer as obviously they have duplicated 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.150
 the nine vehicles do not have to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.060
 double ten times since the last 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.740
 they will simply put the original not the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.410
 original car as they see that I give everything 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.290
 shocked but it does not matter what we put and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.750
 as you can see is the last one is the car 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000
 the tenth and well as I tell you it does not 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.900
 it needs to duplicate it already as they have nine 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.090
 cars 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.450
 then friends here is how you can 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.879
 see our 10 as this car is called 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.000
 he does not remember us what they are called but still 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.670
 to be our 10 carts 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.040
 easy and fast duplicates that you leave if 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.859
 it's pretty fast a friend here is going 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.470
 Well, an advice if you do not 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.230
 it works and tells them that it does not leave them 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.780
 putting the car in the garage is very simple 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.780
 he simply restarts in his comfort that 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.489
 they pay for it and they learn it again and 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.560
 well the friend who is supposed to 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.290
 he has to be helping he stays with the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.849
 vehicle so they do not lose money that their 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.430
 friend invites you to the session and the 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.530
 vehicle will remain of you already 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.750
 after having turned off and turned on the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.609
 console and well I want to send 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.180
