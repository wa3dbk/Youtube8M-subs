00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 With the action I am strong for the care we are today in the hostel 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.900
 Verein Altenhain and Diakonie-station in the gate 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:15.209
 Here today is the member of the Bundestag of the SPD Monika Griefahn to visit 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.659
 the local nursing homes and the diakonie-station are experiencing the last few years 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.399
 Years not only a significant change in the resident picture 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.069
 but also with your own staff 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.679
 the personnel key is only hard enough for a night watch for 50 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.380
 demented residents 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.920
 and in the daily service must also be expected 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.170
 with a total of twelve training places successful training and others 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.740
 It is offered that many of the professionals stay in the service for years 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.200
 However, the increasing pressure on work takes all employees up to 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.320
 outermost 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.860
 the staff would look forward to being quick 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.720
 to be able to respond flexibly to changing needs of the residents 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 this includes the care for the dying by the hospice 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.980
 that you are often bureaucratic at such a sensitive stage of life 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.000
 Obstacles encountered by the competent authorities is regretted 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.410
 It should not be too expensive for society to do this work 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.680
 Forms other people for society is provided 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920
 we have the Member of the Bundestag Monika Griefahn in their opinion 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.080
 asked 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.370
 Mrs. Griefahn how do you want to live when you are old 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.789
 yes of course i would like to live in and would like to 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.950
 live as long as possible at home but because money is a good field of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.480
 domestic 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.670
 in the end, if, for example, I am the entbehre a good alternative 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.659
 how can care reduce bureaucracy 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.950
 and the nurses are relieved so I hope that we can do it 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.900
 that show here 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.560
 care 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.910
 Weidlinger falls at low this year 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.520
 with flat rates 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.279
 can get worked and then actually 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.159
 no longer before point he 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.759
 the Diakonie in Lower Saxony paid at least ten euros 50 per hour 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.959
 the private employers' association now has a minimum wage of 8 euros 50 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.889
 agreed collectively 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.619
 How high should they be in the minimum wage 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.499
 I am very happy that the animals before 10 50 as collective wage I think 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.299
 that is a very good reward to make it an incentive 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.739
 I think many are demanding a very demanding too 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.409
 paid accordingly 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.279
 I wish very much that the collective wage outdated, what will they actually do about 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.770
 to improve the framework conditions in the care 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.910
 yes, we started the year in the last legislative period 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.689
 Expand all are nursing stages to expand to set up vertices 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 I very much wish that we were 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.779
 make it more attractive so that we can get more people into training 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.479
 and that we now lie in training in the accompanying work 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.419
 Percent for the caregivers 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.049
 Improvement achievable, the tent people are also long in care 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.849
 Working can be booked up very quickly 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.240
 The government has a proposal 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.240
 the need for care can be redefined 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.339
 what do you think and how will you do it? 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.999
 So the SPD has said yes the need for care expanded 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.599
 - that would just need improvements 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.429
 Hettich does not just complain shimmering percent little care 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.489
 it really needs whaling 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.599
 with a fine nose holistically looking at the human being so that is 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.289
 actually what we should aim for 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.169
 Children training 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.349
 so to speak as a holistic social responsibility 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.629
 more information about the action 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.939
 I make myself strong for the care 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.749
