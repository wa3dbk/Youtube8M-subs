00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.130

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.240
 forearm play there just apologize for 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.860
 the skins click noises mans 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 you may hear during the video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.670
 in fact it's when the camera screen 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.369
 goes into standby mode I see more than I 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 so am the click on the button 20 on 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 a button for it to come back on and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.480
 shot from time to time you hear a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.240
 little click 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 so here I am sorry but not that's 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.240
 all the same a good video there you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 wish good viewing 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.359
 it's him people it's the one 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.130
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.489
 we are in a place perfectly skin 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.739
 but I do not know where I am finally the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.920
 know how to get in but I 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.750
 am completely lost it today 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
 is there for the video presentation of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.489
 my derby there are people who have me 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.969
 asked I thought why not 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 I hope you get along well 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.960
 because I have with the microphone of the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 camera and the microphone of the phone like that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 I have two tests in case a leap 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 about at first I think 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.140
 we're going to talk about what's 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 engine 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 there is nothing incredible and then we 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.260
 will see more closely the cycle part then 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 technically I'm in a place 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.880
 perfectly lost for not too much 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.280
 hear me for not so much how to tend 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 for boss hear other people's 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.720
 guys like people who find the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 way to pass 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.799
 here is a small gain 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.229
 and then his motorcycle father who come from 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.570
 place there I was happy what did he do 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.460
 so in short I hope too much of 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.580
 people who have passed and why people 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.090
 who spend here that good brief for the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 motor then when I say nothing of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 really special shown that closer 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 rest of the origin so a cylinder 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.750
 origin 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.009
 there is just a pinion of 14 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 I do not know if we can really up 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.880
 and that in the engine part the carburetor 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.550
 it's a 17 500 1 of origin for the pot 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.060
 exhaust that is perfectly alone 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.409
 ear is a basset the original pot 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.549
 unbridled that has just been repainted in black 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.709
 the little oak is also a type 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.340
 origins I do not think it's a 14 53 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.810
 or something special like that for 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.600
 ignition is one of origin that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 had it changed so go for the engine there 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.100
 there really is nothing incredible 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.130
 at the limit a small counter that db 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.269
 0 a cold air and so we will see 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.799
 the electric after I showed you 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.810
 because it's really a fucking 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.130
 brothel in there 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.100
 so that's for the motor respect nothing 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.810
 really special just i do not know too much 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.890
 how long will the video last because 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.359
 that I do not know that much 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.790
 take I think not too long but 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:40.700
 we'll see now so low as 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 you could surely drink I have a kit 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.200
 deco ktm 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.430
 finally who is a little bit to larache 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.140
 so in fact what follows I make them 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.609
 myself just completely I did 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.840
 all the dozens on photoshop I the 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.109
 printed on sticker paper 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.209
 and well, I stuck them, it was very 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.579
 galley it's not ultra clean good I 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.739
 find it more fun at all black then 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.170
 it's quite original in me I like 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.000
 what I had seen from people who did that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.220
 on bath rugby in the image I had it 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.230
 type derby ktm and I had completely 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.819
 drooled but if I want some I've looked for 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 everywhere on the internet I have not found 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.390
 and I said bah I like the move 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.790
 ass and then I will make one and in what 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.739
 maybe two months in all gerard cyr 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.799
 in rather clean iron so I was 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.000
 happy so that's why it's complicated and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.470
 an age are all black had 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 repainted a bit rabies so it's not 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.350
 super clean is also why 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.790
 I put stickers 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.890
 the frozen slope my run I was fine 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.050
 disgusting would want the recovery 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 wins because there is a side that is 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.240
 rusty grate disgusting and the other 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.250
 side that is black rather clean you can 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.860
 to say that like that they are that the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.840
 fucking change of paint back so 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.200
 here I let you look at yourself 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.720
 even 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.220
 as for the electric ones so the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.860
 count ory the counter I had you 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.540
 said otherwise bah I do not know if you can 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.810
 see but it's good of rebels in the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.030
 city 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.610
 I sometimes have a little trouble 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.780
 of good contacts nothing really nasty 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.240
 but that's the brothel anyway 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.260
 original swing headlamp 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.920
 I do not know what to say because we 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.450
 asked me to do another 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.100
 presentation how do you want 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.910
 no motorcycle late shows you a photo 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.340
 you wash the bike the same fork 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.190
 she is of origin 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.840
 nothing special that co so I believe so 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.910
 it's a tuner but it's a small 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.460
 the origin there is really nothing 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.630
 really amazing so I think 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.580
 I 'm going to change it to understand a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.930
 little style and there is still a car 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.380
 who gets off that why the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.380
 cars arrive 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.030
 this karembeu heard me well because 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.190
 I just saw that on my phone 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.080
 I just stopped recording my 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.720
 voice without doing so on purpose 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.150
 last and last try it's on the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.360
 camera 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.300
 tommy really full of cars so 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.600
 here are a few more angles 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.050
 so see the derby is a 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.850
 derbi senda and sam x trem of 2005 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.810
 so the bike is still ten years old 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.550
 so necessarily it is not nickel 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.260
 so a little disgusting that same time 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.640
 at the age of 10 so I tell myself it's simple 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.170
 normal and that's the retype a bit like 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.490
 I can only when I bought him 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.250
 it was really a wreck 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.480
 finally it was bagelet really buy 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.650
 not at all expensive to retype when 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.190
 I bought relay even not there was a 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.890
 ignition problem and so I have 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.020
 settled wise bought a January ignition 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.240
 I have a lot of problems as a result 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.040
 it was really broken balls but there 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.680
 it's going to be maybe a month a month and 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.160
 half runs perfectly well and that I 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.710
 I'm really happy and there, yesterday 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.370
 changed so the small ones 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.260
 conti handles that go with my room 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.670
 just conti and soon taxes 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.280
 included in the place of this fucking worth 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.930
 original a little bit of gloss I 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.730
 also changed my retro in the front i 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.130
 put his full task he was missing one 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.540
 there was one that was the 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.730
 plastic there in fact they were removed 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.950
 so it was not really that it was 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.780
 a little rubbish what so here I have 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.240
 ras I bought it is here today 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.660
 I just changed but my leverage 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.420
 Clutch and Front Brake Nogent 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.740
 black prices by gal galley a little 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.090
 the masters because she pursues there in 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.550
 does the sheet that I fit a little 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.290
 little that I line all that was rather 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.480
 boring but good in the end it makes me good 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.650
 I'm happy I was a little scared by 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.600
 compared to the original ones because they 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.570
 are really great eh but actually 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.590
 pass nickel gpat slap that because 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.470
 I have electrical and cold proofs 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.860
 not even that I have a horn on it 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.000
 besides, but who tends us to 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.360
 the moment he does not walk I do not know 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.910
 Why 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.540
 pretty must contact the bike is 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.860
 a wreck at the same time otherwise bah si 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.390
 you know no you do not know 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.280
 too much the derbies it's still 50 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.380
 necessarily the 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.370
 tank its 1 7 liter so it's not 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.260
 unbelievable 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.340
 what do you do three hundred 300 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.220
 kilometers with that and if not bah I think 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.520
 that I have nothing else to say really 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:03.250
 audi me I do not know what to say I have not 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.790
 too much else to say in fact I 'm going 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.790
 redo a little tour 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.110
 I take advantage of everything today precisely 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.480
 to film this video because for 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.130
 once the weather is nice it's hot 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.050
 and sugar like a pig in my 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.100
 motorcycle jacket I might not have 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.100
 not due m but it does not matter 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.800
 so here I am going to leave you on 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:49.210
 this small view that modulates 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.210
 quite stylish way as in the movies
