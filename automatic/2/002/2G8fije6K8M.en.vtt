00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to the Mac the Mac one I think was like

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.720 
to the Mac the Mac one I think was like
20<00:02:20.709> something<00:02:21.010> dollars<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.260> there<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.730> less

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
20 something dollars and there is less

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.259 
20 something dollars and there is less
in<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.359> think<00:02:25.719> I<00:02:26.790> can't<00:02:27.790> really<00:02:27.909> tell<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
in here I think I can't really tell you

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.899 
in here I think I can't really tell you
how<00:02:28.420> much<00:02:28.569> less<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.319> obviously<00:02:30.069> compare<00:02:30.639> the

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
how much less but obviously compare the

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.459 
how much less but obviously compare the
two<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:32.079> mac<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.469> probably<00:02:32.980> has<00:02:33.370> um<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.780> lot

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
two the mac one probably has um a lot

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.069 
two the mac one probably has um a lot
less<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:39.069> mac<00:02:39.280> one<00:02:39.659> tends<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.930> wear

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
less in it and the mac one tends to wear

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.770 
less in it and the mac one tends to wear
off<00:02:41.290> within<00:02:41.680> i<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.670> say<00:02:42.819> about<00:02:42.849> 40<00:02:43.569> minutes

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
off within i would say about 40 minutes

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.929 
off within i would say about 40 minutes
and<00:02:44.139> that's<00:02:44.739> how<00:02:44.950> i<00:02:46.349> know<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.889> reapply<00:02:48.340> so

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
and that's how i know to like reapply so

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.210 
and that's how i know to like reapply so
within<00:02:49.120> about<00:02:49.329> forty<00:02:49.689> minutes<00:02:49.780> time<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:51.040> mac

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
within about forty minutes time the mac

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.059 
within about forty minutes time the mac
one<00:02:51.489> where<00:02:51.939> software<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:53.069> victoria's

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
one where software as the victoria's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.009 
one where software as the victoria's
secret<00:02:54.340> one<00:02:54.459> stays<00:02:55.150> for<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.780> about<00:02:55.900> two

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
secret one stays for like about two

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.629 
secret one stays for like about two
hours<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.799> still<00:02:56.980> looks<00:02:57.010> nice<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.519> glossy

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
hours and it still looks nice and glossy

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.390 
hours and it still looks nice and glossy
and<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:59.079> victoria<00:02:59.469> secret<00:02:59.500> one<00:02:59.859> is<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.069> lot

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
and the victoria secret one is a lot

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.319 
and the victoria secret one is a lot
more<00:03:00.639> glossy<00:03:01.180> ER<00:03:01.419> than<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.859> mac<00:03:03.099> one<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:06.329> the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
more glossy ER than the mac one and the

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.030 
more glossy ER than the mac one and the
payoff<00:03:07.540> would<00:03:07.930> probably<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.500> same<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:08.919> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
payoff would probably be the same if you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.479 
payoff would probably be the same if you
were<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.219> get<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.459> victoria<00:03:09.819> secret<00:03:09.849> pink<00:03:10.150> one

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
were to get the victoria secret pink one

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.179 
were to get the victoria secret pink one
just<00:03:12.489> because<00:03:13.169> they<00:03:14.169> are<00:03:14.349> pretty<00:03:14.500> much<00:03:14.709> tinted

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
just because they are pretty much tinted

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.890 
just because they are pretty much tinted
lip<00:03:15.370> balms<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.359> would<00:03:16.450> probably<00:03:16.719> get<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
lip balms so you would probably get the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.289 
lip balms so you would probably get the
same<00:03:16.930> payoff<00:03:17.709> but<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.519> would<00:03:18.699> be<00:03:18.909> a<00:03:19.060> lot

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
same payoff but it would be a lot

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.869 
same payoff but it would be a lot
classier<00:03:19.599> so<00:03:20.440> yeah<00:03:21.040> i<00:03:21.099> just<00:03:21.129> wanted<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.609> share

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
classier so yeah i just wanted to share

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.119 
classier so yeah i just wanted to share
that<00:03:21.940> bit<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.840> information<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:23.859> everyone

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
that bit of information with everyone

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.309 
that bit of information with everyone
because<00:03:24.400> instead<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> spending<00:03:25.599> like<00:03:25.930> 20

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
because instead of spending like 20

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.710 
because instead of spending like 20
something<00:03:26.500> dollars<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.579> mac<00:03:27.760> one<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.599> had

like different scents corresponding with

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.300 
like different scents corresponding with
what<00:03:39.729> kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.659> shade<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.049> get<00:03:41.229> but<00:03:41.919> since

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
what kind of shade you get but since

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.629
