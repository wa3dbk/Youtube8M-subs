shoe to drop how worried are you about
it<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:52.270> it's<00:01:52.299> very<00:01:52.840> worrying<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it well it's very worrying and the the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.620 
it well it's very worrying and the the
the<00:01:53.979> problem<00:01:54.189> now<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.759> AMD<00:01:54.969> has<00:01:55.210> no<00:01:55.420> one

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
the problem now is that AMD has no one

the problem now is that AMD has no one
to<00:01:55.869> provide<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.770> inspiration<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.939> I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
to provide that inspiration and and I

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.700 
to provide that inspiration and and I
think<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.299> goes<00:01:58.420> back<00:01:58.659> several<00:01:59.020> months<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.680> a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
think it goes back several months to a

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.580
