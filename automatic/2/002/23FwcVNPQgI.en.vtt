00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 txeroki my high design print 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.750
 part with the new cherokee you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 you finally find a new face 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.429
 within the session then from the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 bored toyota up the common sling crv 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.379
 nobody had evolved in this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.660
 category my 12 years visiting the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 most proactive autoshow in the world 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 gin- I have been educated by the eye 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 know when you are innovating for good 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 and not making crazy ideas to call the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 attention and in the case of the new 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
 cherokee I clearly see that it has 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 evolved to create a daring one is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.239
 yuri your forehead is without a doubt the most 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 relevant to the bold new design of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 this new competitor where they have left 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 the classic team grill but 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.660
 taking it to a new design standard 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.910
 Its side is modern but without stopping 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
 be adventurous because that's what this new 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 Jeep has to be on its backside 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 we see some innovative and daring 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.090
 skulls that finish very well 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 modern front so much forward 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 like back the new cherokee is 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.320
 different but well accomplished with good 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.900
 taste so in terms of design you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 I can say daring to buy it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.370
 speak well of you once sitting in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 your cabin clearly you see an environment 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.020
 combined between a luxury to suit you and a 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 relaxed style with good materials 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.150
 much better than the current days without 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.890
 tell the great cherokee feels a 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.130
 Well finished board has assembly 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.290
 very well thought out their seats do not 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 would have liked broader as you can 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 be that a corpulent adult does not fit 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 well however they are comfortable and with a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.580
 very good hold when turning on we can 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.400
 know that it is an aspirated engine 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 which produces a very good sound but the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.380
 novelty is in its gearbox 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.720
 Playstation style is virtual 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 Well now this new Cherokee releases 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.150
 worldwide a box with nine changes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 if they sound a lot and in truth there are many 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 but so it has to evolve towards a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.869
 improvement of fuel consumption which 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.720
 already we will measure in a longer test 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.630
 but the most outstanding thing is its system 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.520
 4x4 in its top version as this one 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 allows you to climb stones with only one 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.250
 button or automatic that yes me 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.460
 surprised and it worked very well our 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.890
 in conclusion the Cherokee is finally a 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.510
 new rain in the market with design 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.430
 innovative and last systems 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.240
 generation for those who already 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.240
 they bored with others 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 [Applause] 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.840
