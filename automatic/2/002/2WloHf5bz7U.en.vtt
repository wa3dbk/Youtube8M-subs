00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
team so the default the hotkey for this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.010 
team so the default the hotkey for this
is<00:01:09.350> why<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.970> would<00:01:11.970> suggest<00:01:12.119> changing<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is why i would suggest changing it to a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
is why i would suggest changing it to a
mouse<00:01:13.320> button<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.790> bit

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
mouse button because it's a little bit

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240 
mouse button because it's a little bit
quicker<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> way<00:01:15.619> but<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> different

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
quicker that way but here the different

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
quicker that way but here the different
options<00:01:17.700> sure<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.900> read<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
options sure you can read them all but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350
