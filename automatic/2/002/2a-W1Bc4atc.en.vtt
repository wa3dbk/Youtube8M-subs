00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pocket for stamps but i'm using slope

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.289 
pocket for stamps but i'm using slope
things<00:01:26.490> i<00:01:26.610> found<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.060> staples<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:29.150> glue<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
things i found at staples to glue the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.620 
things i found at staples to glue the
back<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.740> envelope<00:01:32.450> some<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
back of the envelope some of the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.320 
back of the envelope some of the
envelopes<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.200> made<00:01:34.470> myself<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.370> they<00:01:36.150> don't

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
envelopes i made myself so they don't

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.490 
envelopes i made myself so they don't
have<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> sticky<00:01:36.900> strip<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.409> them<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:39.500> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
have a sticky strip on them so that can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.899 
have a sticky strip on them so that can
be<00:01:40.650> used

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.109 

so<00:01:43.689> these<00:01:44.590> are<00:01:44.649> actually<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.490> cards<00:01:45.939> and

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
so these are actually the cards and

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.080 
so these are actually the cards and
envelopes<00:01:46.179> that<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.749> made<00:01:47.249> and<00:01:48.249> I<00:01:48.399> made<00:01:48.549> them<00:01:48.789> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
envelopes that I made and I made them to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.929 
envelopes that I made and I made them to
fit<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.450> little<00:01:49.749> pocket<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.670> they're<00:01:51.819> just

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
fit this little pocket so they're just

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.520 
fit this little pocket so they're just
will<00:01:52.329> be<00:01:52.450> things<00:01:52.689> I<00:01:52.810> guess<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.170> something

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
will be things I guess there's something

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.809 
will be things I guess there's something

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
that you're maybe I guess the little

gift<00:01:55.119> cards<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:57.700> just<00:01:57.909> really<00:01:58.179> small

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.149 

some<00:02:03.429> graphic<00:02:03.819> 45<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.689> benches<00:02:05.619> paper<00:02:05.859> bags

some graphic 45 and benches paper bags

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.100 
some graphic 45 and benches paper bags
and<00:02:06.490> these<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.450> these<00:02:07.780> are<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:07.959> envelopes

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
and these on these are the envelopes

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.940 
and these on these are the envelopes
that<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.590> made<00:02:08.860> on<00:02:09.129> my<00:02:09.190> life<00:02:09.459> Stewart<00:02:10.950> score

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
that I made on my life Stewart score

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.460 
that I made on my life Stewart score
scoring<00:02:12.940> board<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.049> where<00:02:14.260> that

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
scoring board and this is where that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.100 
scoring board and this is where that
little<00:02:14.849> sticky<00:02:15.849> thing<00:02:16.150> go<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:18.900> thought<00:02:19.900> this

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
little sticky thing go I thought this

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.470 
little sticky thing go I thought this
was<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.349> really<00:02:20.560> neat<00:02:20.829> idea<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.579> think<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.329> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
was a really neat idea I think it's a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.410 
was a really neat idea I think it's a
couple<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.870> years<00:02:23.019> old<00:02:23.379> but<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:24.299> tried<00:02:25.299> to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
couple of years old but I tried to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.350 
couple of years old but I tried to
update<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> little<00:02:26.049> bit<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.239> these

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
update it a little bit and then so these

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.839 
update it a little bit and then so these
are<00:02:28.420> tags<00:02:29.310> give<00:02:30.310> tags<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.190> then<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> back

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
are tags give tags and then on the back

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.059 
are tags give tags and then on the back
i<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.150> discussed<00:02:34.840> them<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.200> put<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.920> and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
i just discussed them and put to and

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:45.599 
i just discussed them and put to and
from<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.890> i<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.920> able<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.519> make<00:02:42.700> six<00:02:44.609> that

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609
