 [Music] 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.500
 well and ccoo the truth that in a week 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.060
 every week that we are spending the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 coast party beautifully 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.720
 well because one takes advantage of being rich 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.310
 other kind of activities that out there 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.020
 during the year we can do 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.460
 fundamentally things that have to 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.560
 see things that have to do with the sea 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.239
 with the dunes for example the walks 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.370
 that can not be ports places are 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.720
 different from those in the whole country not all 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.890
 the country of different and that's the good thing 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.510
 that we can go anywhere 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.280
 Argentina and find places 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.080
 wonderful but we are here in this 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.570
 wonderful place a beach we can 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.550
 say if you want new so that's why 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.860
 also called new atlantis is a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.410
 beach that is 7 kilometers south of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.509
 sea ​​of ​​garlic towards the bottom towards me 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.310
 right on the beach this new plant 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.530
 is sorry this sea of ​​garlic there at 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.300
 background are about 7 km good but 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.920
 all this is still part of the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 party on the coast and this place I say 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.720
 which is new unique because 15 years ago 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.250
 in this place we are in a place that 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.710
 has only one access to the beach and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.869
 what they see here is that there are no spas 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.090
 it's all all absolutely beach there 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.830
 relatively few people are very good 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.300
 because it is very calm if one looks for 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 the other side that after the camera goes to 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.290
 go showing from there 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.360
 behind our cameras there is going to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.160
 show there is this picture of colin and 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.260
 showing off for the other side are going to be 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.720
 many cars because because this is the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.150
 exact point where from here to there 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.350
 the cars can access the beach 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.540
 difference out there from what can 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.229
 access in other places where you can not 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.090
 access stella to cars but 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.550
 good is a really new beach les 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.399
 he said he has between approximately 15 10 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.250
 and 15 years here he said there was nothing was 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.570
 all fear the free land and 5 ago 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.550
 ten years ago to start 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.440
 contemplate 5 that started as a rage 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.420
 of growth like that many people 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.489
 started with crochet recommendations 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 go new atlantis and here I have a 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.220
 friend who is new atlantis I have a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.989
 relative equal now atlantis and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.880
 they started walking they started to walk 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.550
 and they saw that this place is wonderful 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.190
 with huge virgin beaches in some 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.810
 places with dunes this with forests 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.970
 barbarians and accesses really 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.770
 spectacular from route 11 to and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.780
 for that reason it is a beach that has gone 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.040
 growing a lot and there are other years 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.380
 no doubt one comes and finds 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.180
 casanueva new places new neighbors 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.360
 and it is giving is a wonderful day 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.940
 It was raining a lot during the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.170
 we were afraid because because the truth 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.850
 that was complicated now by luck 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.860
 is a little bit on one side is cute 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.800
 nice the temperature was close to 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.690
 the 26 is 27 degrees to do is more 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.860
 that nice the day but there are no signs 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.480
 like it's going to rain out there when 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.340
 we have finished the program can be 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.330
 that we have more clouds but we had 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.190
 fear and we said because as 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.950
 he explained that this is a virgin beach 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.820
 has a hostel here has only one 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.830
 good hostel we can complicate being 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.330
 here we were going to complicate this viewpoint 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.740
 because it 's a little bit more and you think 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.480
 for here because I want to show the 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.830
 marfilense the amplitude of the sea this is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.959
 a directly family beach 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.850
 nicolás and tamara and a beach where there 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.190
 a lot of family where a lot of people come 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.110
 it comes with with their children with their 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.980
 nephews with their cousins in short with 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.800
 Many people 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.290
 little yes, because one who puts his 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.300
 umbrella for your folder and the guys 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 they play they run they run and one does not have to 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.840
 be then be around with some 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.820
 true fear where our beaches are 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.260
 a lot more people here does not end the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.060
 party of the coast as I mentioned 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.640
 yet so few kilometers 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.709
 is very very broad this game of the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.660
 very big coast but here on this beach 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.200
 new atlantis this one can come and 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.030

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.760
 have a barbaric program my friends 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.410
 because because we're going to be counting there 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.450
 many things that have to do with a 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.459
 mobile cinema a cinema that goes for everyone 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.120
 be telling what it is about we are going to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.200
 have also many more other things that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.500
 they have to do with the history of this 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.480
 place let's talk of course of good 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.269
 of a lot more that has to do with things 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.680
 that go through this place and for 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.019
 different situations that are happening 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.970

 nicholas camera that people out there are going 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.110

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.660
 all the people who look at you how was this 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.500

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.249
 growth of houses because when 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.839
