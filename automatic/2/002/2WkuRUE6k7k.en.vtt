00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.020
 welcome everyone bator pro and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
 today's video we'll talk about 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.639
 very good despite the fact that he 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.920
 very simple profit system 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.480
 on the bookmaker will become 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.990
 open sport and like basketball 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 choose basketball the next hour to us 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.939
 Shown 3 boy meaning bet 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
 betting is on the winner first 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.800
 quarter of an hour and how I personally choose 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.220
 tasks for in the first quarter basically 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 with good maneuverability and thanks to their 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.660
 well in cent this allows us 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 play year after year but personally I have never 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.870
 We did not merge in this strategy so we are looking 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 first to watch a suitable match myself 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.750
 reporting fisherman h they are unique first 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.510
 prerequisite for a powerful fit 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 need to see what is in shape 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 team to perform well what are you forms 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 same on the latest games and judged and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 points difference is also slightly better 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.730
 unica he 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.189
 but then we need to look politicians 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.979
 the last three four too often 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.110
 just won 1 were considered but here we are 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.030
 this is not visible from what one match us 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.470
 shown so start not suitable 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.210
 the next farm match 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.439
 Tarna Jafar can't see the team playing 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.600
 about the same but slightly better 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:36.299
 the last match and the difference and points 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 it is the second team that plays next 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740
 watch the last four games from personal 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.930
 meeting 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.320
 here we see exactly our team 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.420
 which above form and then lost but 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.189
 here you can see the last two 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 important in another is the second team 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 if here by formant today we also 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.049
 nothing should interfere exactly 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.799
 you can still win the first quarter 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.320
 see how behaved then on 1 other 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.020
 team with other rivals first 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 quarters we see lost well 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.670
 which command we will stand 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.349
 Lost Lost Lost Lost 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.240
 lost that is, we see no 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.730
 once in the last 5 games commanded 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.400
 Forman and others who will not put 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.250
 won first read unlike 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.099
 mandrel jig who won lost 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.599
 won lost won won 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.060
 take off time but i thought shake off 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.790
 dug up the farm they won't make 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.190
 much work judging by all the data that we 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.530
 gathered to win the first teacher 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 actually on this its stand for these scenes 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.989
 stuffing 1 well I kinda have this bet 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.840
 did not the first time trying 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.700
 rewrite video match will be in 54 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.590
 minutes, I actually wait when he 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.080
 end and take off of course the result a 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.630
 now let's repeat the essence 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.610
 strategies so choose mostly feel 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.560
 can choose one ball can 2 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.200
 but more I do not advise how will 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.450
 uncomfortable catching up with openers voip office 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.160
 piss and watch the latest games that is 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.799
 command form for the last gram and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.290
 points difference is a letter r we are not in 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.010
 deep minus you mean ass and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.859
 poorly played team I'm sitting in the plus yes 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.109
 teams real well here we see that 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.390
 both teams form about the same 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.780
 however, the second team looks better and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.049
 because 0 to 2 out of 5 200 last 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.109
 tigers differ by farm invited and not 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.540
 hit the pupils that is a little better 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.140
 2 teams continue to look at the last 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.260
 three four 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.420
 3-4 personal meeting then most often times 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.670
 first quarter here we see that 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.660
 it was our team that won 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.970
 which form is better tristar on jig and 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.489
 the next third point we look like led 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.680
 yourself first second team last 5 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.140
 games ahead are difficult to farm at all 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.780
 never won 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.250
 the last 5 are copied and when is jack 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.480
 won in my three of five and 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.220
 after analyzing the accounts we understand that 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.840
 Thorn firing probably will not be 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.519
 great labor to beat the pair to him in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.280
 first quarter judging by all this data 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.829
 he is much better in theory should 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.880
 look into 1 consider what the first 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.620
 team 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.220
 actually based on this we do 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.740
 price forecast most often one 7-3 barely that 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.610
 very good for dogon this way not 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.590
 a forecast is made 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.360
 well now i'll wait roll over 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:42.940
 match, wait for the final result 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.940
 and I will shoot the result on what we see
