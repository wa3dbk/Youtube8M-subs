00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
resources we didn't lure the the heroes

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
resources we didn't lure the the heroes
because<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.789> didn't<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
because I didn't really think that was a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
because I didn't really think that was a
problem<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
problem at first so now we're going to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
problem at first so now we're going to
attack<00:00:48.780> from<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.260> top<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> base<00:00:50.100> we're

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
attack from the top of the base we're

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
attack from the top of the base we're
just<00:00:50.940> basically<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.110> those<00:00:52.289> resource

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just basically going for those resource

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
just basically going for those resource
minds<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> looks<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.670> most<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
minds because it looks like most of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
minds because it looks like most of
those<00:00:54.420> resources<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> collectors

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
those resources are in the collectors

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
those resources are in the collectors
and<00:00:56.520> minds<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.870> tell<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> animation

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and minds you can tell by the animation

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.510 
and minds you can tell by the animation
on<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.539> yeah<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.430> going

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
on them so yeah so I think we're going

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250 
on them so yeah so I think we're going
to<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> 50-percent<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.840> well

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to be going for a 50-percent as well

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.740 
to be going for a 50-percent as well

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
going to be meat shielding we got the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
going to be meat shielding we got the
Town<00:03:09.150> Hall<00:03:09.180> we<00:03:09.599> secure<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:09.989> tunnel<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.860> do

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
Town Hall we secure the tunnel so we do

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.930 
Town Hall we secure the tunnel so we do
not<00:03:11.370> need<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.239> fifty<00:03:12.660> percent

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
not need to get that fifty percent

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.910 
not need to get that fifty percent
wizard<00:03:14.940> towers<00:03:15.299> doing<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.870> lot<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.410> damage<00:03:16.739> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
wizard towers doing a lot of damage to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.520 
wizard towers doing a lot of damage to
those<00:03:17.250> giants<00:03:17.819> hopefully<00:03:18.690> those<00:03:18.930> archers<00:03:19.260> can

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
those giants hopefully those archers can

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.770 
those giants hopefully those archers can
get<00:03:19.799> rid<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.220> elixir<00:03:20.670> storage<00:03:21.329> before

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
get rid of that elixir storage before

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.379 
get rid of that elixir storage before
that<00:03:22.560> was<00:03:22.739> hurt<00:03:22.859> our<00:03:23.069> aims<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:23.940> them<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.299> it

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
that was hurt our aims at them so it

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.819 
that was hurt our aims at them so it
looks<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.569> they<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.109> took<00:03:25.260> them<00:03:25.410> down<00:03:25.560> and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
looks like they just took them down and

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.150 
looks like they just took them down and
we<00:03:26.160> got<00:03:26.340> one<00:03:26.670> laser<00:03:26.910> storage<00:03:27.299> left<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.780> has

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
we got one laser storage left it has

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.400 
we got one laser storage left it has
112,000<00:03:29.160> elixir<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.819> which<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.380> lot<00:03:31.380> of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
112,000 elixir in it which is a lot of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.740 
112,000 elixir in it which is a lot of
it<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.799> unfortunately<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:33.239> looks<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.510> we

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
it and unfortunately it looks like we

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.110 
it and unfortunately it looks like we
can<00:03:33.959> not<00:03:34.260> get<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.579> gonna<00:03:35.700> let<00:03:35.880> our

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
can not get it so I'm just gonna let our

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.110 
can not get it so I'm just gonna let our
Giants<00:03:36.599> die<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.889> I'm<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.790> going

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
Giants die out here and I'm just going

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.900 
Giants die out here and I'm just going
to<00:03:39.150> put<00:03:39.510> down<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.560> barbs<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.040> archers<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:41.730> in

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
to put down my barbs and archers here in

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.809 
to put down my barbs and archers here in
a<00:03:42.000> lash<00:03:42.269> last-ditch<00:03:43.200> effort<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.819> basically

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
a lash last-ditch effort to basically

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.970 
a lash last-ditch effort to basically
secure<00:03:45.419> some<00:03:45.660> more<00:03:45.840> elixir<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.560> some<00:03:46.829> more

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
secure some more elixir and some more

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.530 
secure some more elixir and some more
dark<00:03:47.220> elixir<00:03:47.489> if<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.389> possible<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.540> it

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
dark elixir if that is possible so it

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.569 
dark elixir if that is possible so it
looks<00:03:51.720> like<00:03:51.780> we<00:03:52.109> haven't<00:03:52.590> gotten<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.250> lot<00:03:53.430> of

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
looks like we haven't gotten a lot of

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.099 
looks like we haven't gotten a lot of
dark<00:03:53.760> elixir<00:03:54.030> yet<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.549> actually<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.810> we

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
dark elixir yet and actually I think we

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.870 
dark elixir yet and actually I think we
found<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.470> six<00:03:58.709> dark<00:03:58.950> elixir<00:03:59.160> from<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.639> but

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
found like six dark elixir from that but

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.879 
found like six dark elixir from that but
whatever<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.690> think<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.290> good<00:04:01.590> rate

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
whatever I think this is a good rate

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.240 
whatever I think this is a good rate
overall<00:04:03.440> 242,000<00:04:04.440> elixir<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.099> that's

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
overall 242,000 elixir and that's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
overall 242,000 elixir and that's
basically<00:04:05.519> what<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:05.970> was<00:04:06.299> going<00:04:06.569> for<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:07.470> my
