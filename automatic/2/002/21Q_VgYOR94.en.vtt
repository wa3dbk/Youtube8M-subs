00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
going to be in pristine shape and I

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.029 
going to be in pristine shape and I
think<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.389> if<00:04:24.539> buyers<00:04:25.139> get<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.680> Spain

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
think that if buyers get that Spain

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.490 
think that if buyers get that Spain
mentality<00:04:26.820> then<00:04:27.660> you're<00:04:27.960> gonna<00:04:28.080> see<00:04:28.350> your

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
mentality then you're gonna see your

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.219 
mentality then you're gonna see your
trade-in<00:04:28.889> values<00:04:29.280> go<00:04:29.780> skyrocket<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.990> think

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
trade-in values go skyrocket and I think

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.020 
trade-in values go skyrocket and I think
you'll<00:04:31.350> see<00:04:31.380> your<00:04:31.650> expectations<00:04:32.550> met<00:04:32.820> when

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
you'll see your expectations met when

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.360 
you'll see your expectations met when
you<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.539> dealer<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.830> think<00:04:35.039> that's

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
you get to the dealer so I think that's

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.830 
you get to the dealer so I think that's
it<00:04:35.550> for<00:04:35.699> now<00:04:35.789> yeah<00:04:36.180> well<00:04:36.449> if<00:04:36.510> there<00:04:36.660> was<00:04:36.750> one
