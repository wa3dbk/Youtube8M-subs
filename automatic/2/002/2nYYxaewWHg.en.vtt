is only in topaz but I think it means
reduced<00:01:11.670> noise<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> looks<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> same

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
reduced noise because it looks the same

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
reduced noise because it looks the same
