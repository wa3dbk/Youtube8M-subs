00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.639
 one day we will see in 1976 when 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.030
 well the feet rescue eight pets are 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.529
 what we see there on the screen inside 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.529
 the transport cages 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.780
 here what we are going to do we have to 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.340
 try to remove all the protections 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.270
 with the minimum amount of movement 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.160
 possible 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.140
 come to take out 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.770
 all the protections will look like a 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.570
 key but when they are still missing 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.560
 fewer movements I do not remember well 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.680
 how much 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.380
 I'm a bird, they're going to use it obviously 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.050
 as soon as it appears but they have to try 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.930
 to have more monkeys more or less like 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.930
 said the level 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.370
 best possible with the least amount of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.370
 possible protections already 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 then they will not need so many 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.960
 movements to finish passing the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.970
 level because if they will not pass are not 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.710
 there are very few movements left 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 Once it looks like the key 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.360
 showed up 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 so let's try to do the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 functional and we use it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.120
 what I was saying, I have few left 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.120
 movements and as I had already 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.540
 accommodated 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.470
 level 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.640
 I have more possibilities of passing them but 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.640
 if it does not complicate much 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.979
 so I try to bring it the best 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.979
 possible 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.330
 maximum is at the end with what 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.120
 Two or three movements are missing 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.870
 more with the ming vase and did not bring 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.870
 opportunities 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.050
 good but I can pass it also and we 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.830
 we see in the next 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.830
 regards
