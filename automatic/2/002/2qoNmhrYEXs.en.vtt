00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello youtube, my name is mateus 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.389
 Queiroz and I'm here to teach. 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.490
 you how to tune it is with bridge was 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.280
 strict 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.020
 you father ten simple steps to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.930
 who is amateur and knows nothing can 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:27.439
 tune and balance a guitar 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:33.380
 with bridge was strict first step 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 remove the back of the guitar 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:51.270
 then the second step with the bar to the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:01:03.090
 lever that allows you to remove the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:06.500
 bridge to make the personnel calls with the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.310
 put the bar on 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.390
 You will raise the points. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:21.119
 raise points and leave me veiled or 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.020
 be safe and the bridge until it is 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 straight after revealing the bridge the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.210
 third step is with the bridge in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.240
 position ask someone, right? 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.579
 chen chang the help of someone so that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.079
 holding for you if you have 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.619
 difficulties with the bridge in this position 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 You will place an object here in the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.600
 wood one to use anything one 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.130
 Sturdy object you should place here 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 and do not let the bridge leave the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.969
 place 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:06.259
 ok beauty the fourth step is the bet is 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:11.020
 caught in the distance between the bridge 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:14.770
 and the end of the guitar body 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.750
 It's because you will need this measure. 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.850
 to later tune the guitar 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.580
 in order to finalize your 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.800
 tuning ok 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:40.510
 Step 5 with the bridge locked loosen the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:44.610
 botnets release lots to start 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.540
 normal tuning with you will fine tune 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.310
 By the head rates, it's okay. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 before you start tuning 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:01.450
 remember to loosen or tighten all 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.660
 the microfilm screws until the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.270
 they are centralized 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.430
 they should not be totally 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:16.270
 tight or totally cute 6th step 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.160
 after tuning the strings of the mode 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.440
 normal trave 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.440
 the lot with the key l required to 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.709
 tighten the screws 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.740
 then step 7 remove the wooden latch 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.410
 which prevents the structure of the bridge reminds 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.510
 you put a wooden board or a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.959
 object here to catch the bridge so that 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.270
 in turn we can take it step 168 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.290
 check whether the structure of the bridge 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:57.190
 government whether back or forward 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:00.340
 because it passes the name correct the position of the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:08.050
 structure of the bridge by loosening or 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:11.560
 tightening our spring stream or 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.330
 also called brand springs you will 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.500
 loosening the tightening 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:23.219
 in your case, these screws until 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 that the position of the bridge structure 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:30.759
 be as far as you measure 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.280
 previously the structure of the 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.319
 bridge shall be in the key position at 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.110
 same as you worked to be able to 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:44.349
 sign the ropes and one-tenth the last 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:47.349
 after leveling is balanced in the 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.569
 the bridge leaving the position 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.330
 key for tuning 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:58.270
 you will notice that when you play the strings 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.610
 it is not nearly in the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.360
 to correct this gap 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:11.379
 you will fine-tune the finished tuning their 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.939
 guitar by the screws of 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:18.509
 microfiltration was what I asked for 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:21.490
 to let you leave them 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:25.000
 centralized so you need 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.639
 the more tones you open 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.180
 if you need tones below you 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:35.729
 loose the little gallery, I think that's it 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.699
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:42.629
 Share it so much 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.129
 people who have this difficulty can 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:49.229
 solve this problem 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.229
 Thank you and see you next time.
