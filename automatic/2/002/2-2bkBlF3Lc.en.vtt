00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
ignition timing I'm able to get quite a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.010 
ignition timing I'm able to get quite a
bit<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:17.000> participate<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.450> efficiency

bit of a participate of an efficiency

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.130 
bit of a participate of an efficiency
boost<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> power<00:01:20.009> boost<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.140> setup

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
boost or a power boost out of this setup

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.399 
boost or a power boost out of this setup
so<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> said<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.259> at

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so right now it's like I said it's in at

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.450 
so right now it's like I said it's in at
about<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.040> 0.9<00:01:26.820> revision<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.689> 0.10<00:01:28.340> some<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
about of 0.9 revision or 0.10 some of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.679 
about of 0.9 revision or 0.10 some of
the<00:01:29.520> things<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.090> still<00:01:30.360> need<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> be

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the things that you still need to be

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
the things that you still need to be
done<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.560> need<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.070> redo<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> throttle

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
done is I need to do redo the throttle

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
done is I need to do redo the throttle
linkage<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.170> issues

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
linkage because it's got some issues

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.420 
linkage because it's got some issues
with<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> original<00:01:36.750> design<00:01:37.310> obviously<00:01:38.310> as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with the original design obviously as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
with the original design obviously as
you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> wiring<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> an

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you can see the wiring is kind of an

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
you can see the wiring is kind of an
errata<00:01:40.530> nest<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.189> Jody<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
errata nest so Jody and I are going to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.390 
errata nest so Jody and I are going to
be<00:01:42.420> redoing<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> wiring<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> repositioning

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
be redoing the wiring and repositioning

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.160 
be redoing the wiring and repositioning
some<00:01:44.579> components<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> clean<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> wiring

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
some components to clean up the wiring

the<00:02:04.049> battery<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> fuel<00:02:05.820> pressure

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the battery over here is a fuel pressure

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.090 
the battery over here is a fuel pressure
regulator<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.110> returns<00:02:07.320> back<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
regulator which then returns back to the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.120 
regulator which then returns back to the
tank<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.540> I<00:02:09.600> think<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> second

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
tank and so I think on the second

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.770 
tank and so I think on the second
revision<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> we're<00:02:12.090> also<00:02:12.329> going<00:02:12.690> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
revision of this we're also going to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
revision of this we're also going to
eliminate<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> low<00:02:13.530> pressure<00:02:13.770> pump<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.430> feed

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
eliminate the low pressure pump and feed

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.380 
eliminate the low pressure pump and feed
that's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.070 
that's
we<00:02:16.080> had<00:02:16.230> gravity<00:02:16.710> from<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.069> bottom<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
we had gravity from the bottom of the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.140 
we had gravity from the bottom of the
existing<00:02:19.080> tank<00:02:19.650> drain<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.550> Jensen<00:02:21.000> Healey

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
existing tank drain in the Jensen Healey

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
existing tank drain in the Jensen Healey
tank<00:02:23.390> that's<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.930> about<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.340> using

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
tank that's really about it it is using

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
tank that's really about it it is using
a<00:02:27.120> coolant<00:02:27.450> temperature<00:02:27.900> sensor<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.500> throttle

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
a coolant temperature sensor a throttle

position sensor this vacuum line that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.050 
position sensor this vacuum line that
senses<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.280> manifold<00:02:35.280> air<00:02:35.430> pressure<00:02:35.730> in

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
senses the the manifold air pressure in

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.380 
senses the the manifold air pressure in
the<00:02:36.090> manifold<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:38.520> fuel<00:02:39.209> pressure

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the manifold and the fuel pressure

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.660 
the manifold and the fuel pressure
regulator<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:41.010> air<00:02:41.250> temperature

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
regulator and this air temperature

sensor for the incoming air intake and

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.280 
sensor for the incoming air intake and
that's<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.160> all<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.610> using<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that's really all it's using for to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.410 
that's really all it's using for to
measure<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.920> load<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.880> figure<00:02:48.180> out<00:02:48.239> how

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
measure the load and and figure out how

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630 
measure the load and and figure out how
much<00:02:48.570> fuel<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.410> there's<00:02:50.160> also<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
much fuel is going on there's also a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.490 
much fuel is going on there's also a
crank<00:02:50.940> fire<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> ignition<00:02:51.750> system<00:02:52.110> up<00:02:52.260> here

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
crank fire and ignition system up here

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920 
crank fire and ignition system up here
so<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:52.920> you'll<00:02:53.100> notice<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:54.390> reach<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.750> here

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so if you'll notice I can reach in here

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.990 
so if you'll notice I can reach in here
and<00:02:55.080> there's<00:02:55.200> no<00:02:55.350> distributor

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and there's no distributor

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
and there's no distributor
so<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.989> distributor<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.530> gone<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:59.070> being

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
so the distributor is gone it's being

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.220 
so the distributor is gone it's being
run<00:02:59.580> off<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.209> toothed<00:03:00.540> wheel<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.140> the

run off of this toothed wheel on the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.870 
run off of this toothed wheel on the
front<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> motor<00:03:01.769> here<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.250> combination

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
front of the motor here in combination

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.280 
front of the motor here in combination
with<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> coil<00:03:03.360> pack<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> controller

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
with the coil pack and the controller

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.440 
with the coil pack and the controller
and<00:03:04.590> then<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> actual<00:03:05.489> ignition<00:03:05.970> timing<00:03:06.180> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and then the actual ignition timing is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.000 
and then the actual ignition timing is
done<00:03:06.660> again<00:03:07.110> by<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.380> mega<00:03:07.590> squirt<00:03:07.890> unit<00:03:10.010> all

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
done again by the mega squirt unit all

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.380 
done again by the mega squirt unit all
right<00:03:11.160> Steve<00:03:11.400> well<00:03:11.580> why<00:03:11.670> don't<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.850> fire<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.180> up

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
right Steve well why don't we fire it up

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.640 
right Steve well why don't we fire it up
and<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.570> what<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> sounds<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:15.290> hopefully<00:03:16.290> no

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and see what it sounds like hopefully no

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:29.500 
and see what it sounds like hopefully no
parts<00:03:16.980> will<00:03:17.190> fall<00:03:17.459> off<00:03:17.670> or<00:03:17.940> burst<00:03:18.150> into<00:03:18.330> flame

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.789 

one<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.659> nice<00:03:30.810> things<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.170> can<00:03:31.379> see<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
one of the nice things you can see is

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.470 
one of the nice things you can see is
unlike<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> traditional<00:03:32.519> Jensen<00:03:33.299> Healey

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
unlike the traditional Jensen Healey

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.960 
unlike the traditional Jensen Healey
startup<00:03:34.140> there's<00:03:34.470> no<00:03:34.709> continuous<00:03:35.489> cranking

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
startup there's no continuous cranking

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.069 
startup there's no continuous cranking
of<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.120> car<00:03:36.329> trying<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.870> everything

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
of the car trying to get everything

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.220 
of the car trying to get everything
going<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:38.340> idling<00:03:38.849> nicely<00:03:39.420> now<00:03:39.810> one<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
going it's idling nicely now one of the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.990 
going it's idling nicely now one of the
things<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.530> keep<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.890> mind<00:03:41.099> is<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> car<00:03:41.730> has

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
things to keep in mind is this car has

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.420 
things to keep in mind is this car has
not<00:03:42.299> been<00:03:42.360> tuned<00:03:42.930> yet<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
not been tuned yet so this is just the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.069 
not been tuned yet so this is just the
default<00:03:44.609> tune<00:03:45.090> package<00:03:45.659> so<00:03:47.510> Steve<00:03:48.510> ghosts<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
default tune package so Steve ghosts and

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.330 
default tune package so Steve ghosts and
Teru<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.470> does<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.799> rest<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.159> his

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
Teru and does the rest of his

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.559 
Teru and does the rest of his
modifications<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:53.340> next<00:03:53.939> phase<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.359> that

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
modifications the next phase of that

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.349 
modifications the next phase of that
will<00:03:54.750> be<00:03:54.900> also<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.530> tune<00:03:56.189> the<00:03:56.640> system<00:03:56.879> so<00:03:57.329> that

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
will be also to tune the system so that

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.879 
will be also to tune the system so that
it's<00:03:57.599> delivering<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.200> correct<00:03:58.530> amount<00:03:58.769> of

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
it's delivering the correct amount of

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:25.490 
it's delivering the correct amount of
fuel<00:03:59.159> etc<00:03:59.510> at<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.540> appropriate<00:04:01.200> times

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.590 

so<00:04:26.040> this<00:04:26.310> pretty<00:04:26.580> much<00:04:26.730> finishes<00:04:27.120> up<00:04:27.390> our

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
so this pretty much finishes up our

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.270 
so this pretty much finishes up our
coverage<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.320> first<00:04:28.530> round<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.040> fuel

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
coverage of the first round of the fuel

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.270 
coverage of the first round of the fuel
injection<00:04:29.850> system<00:04:30.410> after<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.800> next<00:04:32.040> set<00:04:32.190> of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
injection system after the next set of

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.040 
injection system after the next set of
modifications<00:04:32.550> are<00:04:33.180> done<00:04:33.330> we'll<00:04:33.570> make<00:04:33.900> sure

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
modifications are done we'll make sure
