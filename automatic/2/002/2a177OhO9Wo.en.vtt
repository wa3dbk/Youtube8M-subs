wet ingredients into our medium-sized

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
wet ingredients into our medium-sized
Bowl<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.720> egg<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:49.079> we're<00:01:49.229> going

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.430 

this<00:02:02.730> gives<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.420> good<00:02:03.720> consistency

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
this gives it a really good consistency

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.790 
this gives it a really good consistency
and<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.060> adds<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.690> lot<00:02:06.870> of<00:02:06.930> protein<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.650> it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
and it also adds a lot of protein to it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.370 
and it also adds a lot of protein to it
so<00:02:08.540> sometimes<00:02:09.540> I'll<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.230> just<00:02:10.590> with

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
so sometimes I'll make this just with

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.130 
so sometimes I'll make this just with
just<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.560> milk<00:02:13.830> or<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.240> soy<00:02:15.540> milk<00:02:15.660> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
just with milk or just the soy milk and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.380 
just with milk or just the soy milk and
it's<00:02:16.770> fine<00:02:17.010> too<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.940> adds<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.360> extra

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
it's fine too but this adds the extra

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.290 
it's fine too but this adds the extra
protein<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.770> had<00:02:20.010> Greek<00:02:20.910> yogurt

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
protein to it and they had Greek yogurt

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.650 
protein to it and they had Greek yogurt
on<00:02:21.510> sale<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.250> why<00:02:23.250> not<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.450> then

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
on sale so why not all right and then

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.140 
on sale so why not all right and then
I'm<00:02:27.780> going<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.020> add<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.200> cup<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.800> half<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.150> soy

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
I'm going to add a cup and a half of soy

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.080 
I'm going to add a cup and a half of soy
milk<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:32.760> should<00:02:32.970> be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
milk and like you probably should be

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.510 
milk and like you probably should be
using<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.840> measuring<00:02:34.320> cup<00:02:34.530> made<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.190> liquid

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
using a measuring cup made for liquid

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.700 
using a measuring cup made for liquid
when<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:37.350> don't<00:02:37.530> want

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
when you do this but I really don't want

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.730 
when you do this but I really don't want
to<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.190> dishes<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:42.350> one<00:02:43.350> measuring

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
to do the dishes so I use one measuring

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:56.800 
to do the dishes so I use one measuring
cup<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.490> anything<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.300> can

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.630 

and<00:02:58.400> brown<00:02:59.400> sugar<00:02:59.430> is<00:03:00.000> also<00:03:00.390> considered<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.640> wet

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and brown sugar is also considered a wet

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.360 
and brown sugar is also considered a wet
ingredient<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:04.530> add<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> quarter<00:03:05.099> cup<00:03:05.129> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
ingredient so you add a quarter cup of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.630 
ingredient so you add a quarter cup of
brown<00:03:05.549> sugar<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.540> equivalent<00:03:06.599> to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
brown sugar which is the equivalent to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.000 
brown sugar which is the equivalent to
four<00:03:08.640> tablespoons<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.170> lightly<00:03:10.560> pack

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
four tablespoons and I just lightly pack

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.460 
four tablespoons and I just lightly pack
it<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.329> need<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> lot<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.810> sugar<00:03:13.109> in<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it you don't need a lot of sugar in the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.039 
it you don't need a lot of sugar in the
source<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.890> C<00:03:14.069> because<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:15.359> get<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.870> lot<00:03:15.930> of

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
source of C because you get a lot of

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.349 
source of C because you get a lot of
sugar<00:03:16.260> from<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> apples<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.819> if<00:03:21.180> you're

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
sugar from the apples and if you're

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.000 
sugar from the apples and if you're
really<00:03:21.569> trying<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.019> lower<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.409> point<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.799> can

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
really trying to lower the point you can

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.550 
really trying to lower the point you can
use<00:03:23.329> stevia<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.859> you<00:03:25.859> can<00:03:26.129> use<00:03:26.989> splenda<00:03:27.989> if<00:03:28.349> you

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
use stevia or you can use splenda if you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.089 
use stevia or you can use splenda if you
want<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.180> I'm<00:03:30.180> trying<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:31.260> stay<00:03:31.500> away<00:03:31.739> from<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
want to I'm trying to stay away from the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.750 
want to I'm trying to stay away from the
fake<00:03:32.280> sugars<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.310> we're<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.519> going

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
fake sugars as I can so we're just going

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.229 
fake sugars as I can so we're just going
to<00:03:35.819> mix<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.650> all<00:03:37.650> together<00:03:43.909> it's<00:03:44.909> going<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
to mix this all together it's going to

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.940 
to mix this all together it's going to
take<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> minute<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.870> come<00:03:46.109> together<00:03:46.260> sometimes

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
take a minute to come together sometimes

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.800 
take a minute to come together sometimes
it's<00:03:47.159> good<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.400> use<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> whisk<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.420> depends

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
it's good to use a whisk it just depends

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.220 
it's good to use a whisk it just depends
on<00:03:48.900> how<00:03:49.109> much<00:03:49.260> time<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.859> been<00:03:50.069> stirring

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
on how much time you just been stirring

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.660 
on how much time you just been stirring

a half a teaspoon of baking powder so as

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.390 
a half a teaspoon of baking powder so as
i<00:04:27.580> said<00:04:27.610> i<00:04:28.210> like<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.500> use<00:04:29.530> these<00:04:29.950> three<00:04:30.220> dishes

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
i said i like to use these three dishes

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.170 
i said i like to use these three dishes
as<00:04:30.700> possible<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.980> you<00:04:33.250> really<00:04:33.460> do<00:04:33.700> need<00:04:33.880> two

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
as possible but you really do need two

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.860 
as possible but you really do need two
bowls<00:04:34.510> because<00:04:35.370> otherwise<00:04:36.370> i<00:04:36.580> find<00:04:37.210> that<00:04:37.600> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
bowls because otherwise i find that the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.020 
bowls because otherwise i find that the
ingredients<00:04:38.500> don't<00:04:38.680> get<00:04:38.860> combined<00:04:39.250> well<00:04:39.760> so

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
ingredients don't get combined well so

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.250 
ingredients don't get combined well so
