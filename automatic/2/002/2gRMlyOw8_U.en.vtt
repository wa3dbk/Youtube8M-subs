00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.790
 called welcome to the weather that can spread to you again 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.800
 smooth roads are coming and today there were already big ones 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.459
 Temperature differences 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.699
 Neustrelitz - five degrees in the afternoon angle must be at Reit im Winkel Plus 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.820
 80 degrees and they look like the line that is the zero straight line because they are in 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.759
 Northern Germany still temperatures below zero degrees so 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.990
 chilly to the southwest, by contrast, mild air and that is now slow 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.859
 safely pushed back and it comes to Reus the air and that is 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.930
 just snowfall partly freezing rain freezing wet and that could too 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.230
 Tomorrow again lead to catastrophic traffic conditions and before 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.000
 All things also lead to the fact that doctors or power lines under 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 This collapse as a load because it can be said so as ice drizzle came from 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.489
 southern north rhine-westphalia the northern Hesse then over to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.079
 Berlin and Brandenburg north of it partly heavy snowfall and on 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.300
 Afternoon snow drifts also come so morning shows 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.460
 Winter turns from its extremely unpleasant side 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.569
 If you are traveling by car please be very careful 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.809
 In mid-March, Schrader was spread to the southwest 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.910
 partly even black ice rain over the center of Germany in the south mostly 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 dry here but table Dense fog and temperatures went by tomorrow 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.000
 most at minus four to plus one degree also one morning a similar 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.470
 Picture to the north heavy snowfall otherwise partly sleet rain 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.830
 freezing wetness over the middle of Germany to the south ever 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.560
 again some sunshine but also poet and tough fog now 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 in the course of the afternoon, if at all, slowly dissolve 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.390
 and it stays in the afternoon with snowfall in the north and strong 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.350
 up to the stormy wind the allot can lead to drifts 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 So I have a man afternoon in the north and northeast and minus one to 0 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.600
 Degrees to the southwest 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.790
 After all, so three to seven degrees of wind to the south barely noticeable in the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.890
 North as well play heavily in gusts even stormy 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.120
 In the sacred years, the second stone becomes partly even white Christmas 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.899
 so sure 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.780
 and also on Christmas Day falls with it - one to minus 3 degrees and 

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:59.589
 often snowfall
