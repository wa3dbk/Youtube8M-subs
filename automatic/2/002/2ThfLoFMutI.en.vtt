this character I'm not really a fan of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.729 
this character I'm not really a fan of
the<00:00:35.040> whole<00:00:35.070> big<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:36.170> advertised<00:00:37.170> killing

the whole big like advertised killing

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.160 
the whole big like advertised killing
off<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.129> character<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.780> kind<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
off of a character I think it's kind of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
off of a character I think it's kind of
overdone<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.460> cheapening<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
overdone it's really cheapening the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
overdone it's really cheapening the
deaths<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> comic<00:00:43.860> book<00:00:43.980> characters<00:00:44.430> like

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
deaths and of comic book characters like

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
deaths and of comic book characters like
I<00:00:45.500> mean<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> big<00:00:46.770> deal<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> killing<00:00:47.579> off

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I mean a big deal out of killing off

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
I mean a big deal out of killing off
captain<00:00:48.030> america<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.590> brought<00:00:49.829> back

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
captain america and he was brought back

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.930 
captain america and he was brought back
but<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.620> don't<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.340> less<00:00:53.760> than

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but I don't know it was like less than

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.779 
but I don't know it was like less than
two<00:00:54.149> years<00:00:54.180> i<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.809> afterward<00:00:55.730> watching<00:00:56.730> us

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
two years i think afterward watching us

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
two years i think afterward watching us
probably<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.140> still<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
probably one that but but still it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
probably one that but but still it
wasn't<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:58.980> long<00:00:59.100> afterward<00:00:59.910> less<00:01:00.239> than

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
wasn't very long afterward less than

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.100 
wasn't very long afterward less than
five<00:01:00.629> years<00:01:00.660> afterward<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.539> they<00:01:03.539> had<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
five years afterward and they had the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
five years afterward and they had the
whole<00:01:04.260> DC<00:01:04.890> had<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.549> whole<00:01:05.729> Batman<00:01:06.240> r.i.p

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
whole DC had the whole Batman r.i.p

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.920 
whole DC had the whole Batman r.i.p
storyline<00:01:07.409> were<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:08.970> characters<00:01:09.299> new

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
storyline were the other characters new

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
storyline were the other characters new
thought<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.799> he<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.010> dead--<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> think

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
thought that he was dead-- but I think

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
thought that he was dead-- but I think
the<00:01:11.850> audience<00:01:12.030> knew<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.810> Batman<00:01:13.340> survived

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the audience knew that Batman survived

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.270 
the audience knew that Batman survived
the<00:01:14.729> man<00:01:15.150> today<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:16.979> oh

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the man today and it's just like oh

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
the man today and it's just like oh
really<00:01:18.240> overly<00:01:19.080> done<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.479> think<00:01:21.479> with

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
really overly done and I think with

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.380 
really overly done and I think with
conflict<00:01:22.140> us<00:01:22.350> already<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:24.090> that

conflict us already you know that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
conflict us already you know that
there's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> good<00:01:24.960> chance<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> character

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
there's a good chance that the character

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
there's a good chance that the character
can<00:01:26.159> survive<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:27.780> easy

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
can survive it because it's very easy

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
can survive it because it's very easy

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.350 
reveal that the character somehow made
it<00:01:55.090> through<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:57.340> combination<00:01:57.730> of<00:01:58.180> these

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
it through so the combination of these

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
it through so the combination of these
two<00:01:58.420> factors<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.230> really<00:01:59.680> like<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:01.090> my<00:02:01.420> opinion

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
two factors is really like in my opinion

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.400 
two factors is really like in my opinion
and<00:02:03.100> just<00:02:03.430> really<00:02:03.940> cheapening<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.690> deaths<00:02:05.200> of

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
and just really cheapening the deaths of

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.880 
and just really cheapening the deaths of
Congo<00:02:05.950> characters<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.960> feel<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.530> they

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
Congo characters but I do feel that they

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.060 
Congo characters but I do feel that they
did<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.130> good<00:02:09.640> job<00:02:09.700> with<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.660> story<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.920> the

did a good job with the story of the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.760 
did a good job with the story of the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
death of Spiderman in ultimate

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.140 
death of Spiderman in ultimate
spider-man<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:16.360> made<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.320> emotional<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.310> he

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
spider-man they made it emotional and he

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.590 
spider-man they made it emotional and he
kind<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.690> had<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> very<00:02:20.380> heroic<00:02:20.890> death<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.210> in

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
kind of had a very heroic death so in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.950 
kind of had a very heroic death so in
that<00:02:23.500> sense<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.130> do<00:02:25.090> think<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.690> sword

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
that sense I do think that the sword

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.120 
that sense I do think that the sword
story<00:02:26.650> did<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.100> character<00:02:27.460> justice<00:02:28.020> but

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
story did the character justice but

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.590 
story did the character justice but

like it has a consistent momentum and

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.380 
like it has a consistent momentum and
direction<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:16.000> didn't<00:03:16.269> feel

through that so at that point I think a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.580 
through that so at that point I think a
lot<00:03:50.860> of<00:03:50.890> fans<00:03:51.220> muck<00:03:51.660> about<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.170> did<00:03:53.350> there

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
lot of fans muck about like I did there

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.770 
lot of fans muck about like I did there
where<00:03:53.890> it's<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.190> oh<00:03:54.430> they<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.150> confirmed

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
where it's like oh they just confirmed

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.510 
where it's like oh they just confirmed
that<00:03:56.170> they<00:03:56.290> would<00:03:56.470> never<00:03:56.590> kill<00:03:57.010> off<00:03:57.160> with

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
that they would never kill off with

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.000 
that they would never kill off with
Peter<00:03:57.730> Parker<00:03:58.120> but<00:03:58.360> they<00:03:59.050> have<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.590> he<00:03:59.740> taught

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
Peter Parker but they have and he taught

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.550 
Peter Parker but they have and he taught
he's<00:04:00.340> doing<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.760> ranks<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.150> major<00:04:01.990> characters

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
he's doing the ranks of major characters

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.500 
he's doing the ranks of major characters
like<00:04:02.860> Professor<00:04:03.310> Xavier<00:04:04.320> Cyclops<00:04:05.320> Wolverine

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
like Professor Xavier Cyclops Wolverine

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.570 
like Professor Xavier Cyclops Wolverine
Doctor<00:04:07.510> Strange<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:08.200> daredevil<00:04:08.740> who<00:04:09.280> are

Doctor Strange and daredevil who are

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.850

dead<00:04:09.940> in<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.270> Ultimate<00:04:10.630> Universe<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.730> I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
dead in the Ultimate Universe so I I

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.920 
dead in the Ultimate Universe so I I
think<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.040> they're<00:04:15.220> really<00:04:15.550> trying<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:16.060> make

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
think that they're really trying to make

how they continued it there's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.690 
how they continued it there's
speculation<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.840> will<00:05:46.110> be<00:05:46.530> one<00:05:47.370> of<00:05:47.520> his

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
speculation that it will be one of his

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.820 
speculation that it will be one of his
clones<00:05:48.030> either<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.840> female<00:05:49.230> poem<00:05:49.560> which

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
clones either the female poem which

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.030 
clones either the female poem which
would<00:05:49.980> be<00:05:50.220> odd<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.820> have<00:05:51.470> heard<00:05:52.470> being

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
would be odd to have heard being

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.690 
would be odd to have heard being
spider-man<00:05:53.430> or<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.810> clone<00:05:55.170> that<00:05:55.440> was

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
spider-man or the clone that was

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.150 
spider-man or the clone that was
scorpion<00:05:56.700> but<00:05:57.120> he<00:05:57.300> was<00:05:57.420> kind<00:05:57.660> of<00:05:57.980> deranged<00:05:58.980> and

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
scorpion but he was kind of deranged and

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.310 
scorpion but he was kind of deranged and
crazy<00:05:59.340> so<00:05:59.730> not<00:05:59.970> sure

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
crazy so not sure

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.960 
crazy so not sure
he<00:06:00.590> could<00:06:00.770> be<00:06:00.890> so<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.100> ran<00:06:01.370> but<00:06:02.890> it's<00:06:03.890> it<00:06:04.550> will<00:06:04.820> be

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
he could be so I ran but it's it will be

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.370 
he could be so I ran but it's it will be
interesting<00:06:05.210> to<00:06:05.480> see<00:06:05.660> and<00:06:05.780> I<00:06:05.840> think<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.110> lot<00:06:06.350> of

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
interesting to see and I think a lot of

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.130 
interesting to see and I think a lot of
people<00:06:06.500> will<00:06:07.010> pick<00:06:07.580> up<00:06:07.790> this<00:06:08.000> new<00:06:08.390> knew<00:06:09.110> I

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
should experiment just to find out who

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.120 
should experiment just to find out who
this<00:06:11.180> character<00:06:11.420> is<00:06:11.660> or<00:06:12.350> they'll<00:06:12.770> just<00:06:13.010> look

this character is or they'll just look
it<00:06:13.250> up<00:06:13.310> on<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.670> internet<00:06:14.060> right<00:06:14.210> after<00:06:14.510> I

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
it up on the internet right after I

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.140 
it up on the internet right after I
comes<00:06:14.750> out<00:06:14.930> but<00:06:15.500> i<00:06:16.750> think<00:06:17.750> they<00:06:19.150> continuing

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
comes out but i think they continuing
