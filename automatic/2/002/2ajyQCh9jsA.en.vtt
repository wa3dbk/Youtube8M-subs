tab what I have in front of it here is
the<00:00:10.050> case<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:11.099> galaxy<00:00:11.610> tab<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.210> then<00:00:12.300> an<00:00:12.420> iPad

the case the galaxy tab and then an iPad
to<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.799> notice<00:00:14.070> between<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.670> galaxy<00:00:15.210> tab<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
to you notice between the galaxy tab and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.800 
to you notice between the galaxy tab and
the<00:00:16.109> iPad<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.369> thickness<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.970> pretty<00:00:18.539> similar

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the iPad the thickness is pretty similar

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.130 
the iPad the thickness is pretty similar
when<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> comes<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.279> how<00:00:20.490> thick<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:20.970> are

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
when it comes to how thick they are

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.439 
when it comes to how thick they are
however<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.740> case<00:00:23.010> once<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> add<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> adds

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
however the case once you add it it adds

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.210 
however the case once you add it it adds
considerable<00:00:24.810> thickness<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> actual

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
considerable thickness to the actual

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920 
considerable thickness to the actual
galaxy<00:00:26.699> tab<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.180> that's<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
galaxy tab and that's one of the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
galaxy tab and that's one of the
negative<00:00:28.260> features<00:00:28.590> i<00:00:28.710> would<00:00:28.830> say<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
negative features i would say about the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290 
negative features i would say about the
device<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:30.990> other<00:00:31.140> cases<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
device there are other cases like this

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.280 
device there are other cases like this
case<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:34.079> which<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.219> yo<00:00:36.149> bowel<00:00:36.360> which

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
case here which is from yo bowel which

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
case here which is from yo bowel which
is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> leather<00:00:38.129> case<00:00:38.430> once<00:00:38.879> again<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> doesn't

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
is a leather case once again it doesn't

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.630 
is a leather case once again it doesn't
add<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:40.020> protection<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.460> it's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
add that much protection but when it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.319 
add that much protection but when it's
on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.719> actual<00:00:43.200> ipad<00:00:43.770> 2<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.190> doesn't<00:00:44.640> add<00:00:44.820> too

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
on the actual ipad 2 it doesn't add too

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
on the actual ipad 2 it doesn't add too
much<00:00:45.510> thickness<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.100> other

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
much thickness there's also some other

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
much thickness there's also some other
cases<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.910> companies<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.480> marware<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
cases from companies like marware that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
cases from companies like marware that
also<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.460> add<00:00:50.700> too<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.629> thickness<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
also don't add too much thickness to the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
also don't add too much thickness to the
ipad<00:00:52.590> 2<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.699> adds<00:00:53.910> considerable

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
ipad 2 but this one adds considerable

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.290 
ipad 2 but this one adds considerable
depth<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> samsung<00:00:56.430> galaxy<00:00:57.059> tab

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
depth to the to the samsung galaxy tab

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.819 
depth to the to the samsung galaxy tab
and<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.899> probably<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> first

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and that's probably one of the first

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.630 
and that's probably one of the first
negative<00:00:59.789> comments<00:01:00.570> i<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> here

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
negative comments i have of it so here

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
negative comments i have of it so here

this much bulk to the actual device but
this<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> comparison<00:01:42.720> between<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this is kind of a comparison between the

this is kind of a comparison between the
two<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.579> two<00:01:44.759> devices<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.240> are

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
two you have two devices that are

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.060 
two you have two devices that are
supposed<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> very<00:01:45.930> similar<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.770> thinness

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
supposed to be very similar and thinness

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.730 
supposed to be very similar and thinness
yet<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.149> buy<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.570> case<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
yet if you buy this case it's going to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.359 
yet if you buy this case it's going to
be<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:49.950> thick<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:51.380> most<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> cases<00:01:52.799> once

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
be very thick as most of the cases once

be very thick as most of the cases once
you<00:01:53.549> insert<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.299> actual<00:01:55.200> galaxy<00:01:55.619> tab<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.159> you

about the case is that if you want to

about the case is that if you want to

cases I use a dinosaur case as an
example<00:02:42.550> here<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:44.570> good<00:02:45.170> typing<00:02:45.650> angle

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
example here is a good typing angle

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.620 
example here is a good typing angle
let's<00:02:46.580> get<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:47.000> again<00:02:49.150> here's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.240> really

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
let's get that up again here's a really

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.720 
let's get that up again here's a really
good<00:02:50.840> typing<00:02:51.260> angle<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.370> i<00:02:52.460> were<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.670> put

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
good typing angle and if i were to put

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.700 
good typing angle and if i were to put
this<00:02:53.060> case<00:02:53.300> next<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.170> notice<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
this case next to it you notice that the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.280 
this case next to it you notice that the
typing<00:02:55.130> angle<00:02:55.250> isn't<00:02:55.610> even<00:02:55.910> close<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.390> can't<00:02:56.900> if

typing angle isn't even close I can't if

i were to prop it up on the last rubber
strip<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.220> notice<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.820> angle<00:03:02.210> it's

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
strip you notice that that angle it's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.570 
strip you notice that that angle it's
just<00:03:02.480> too<00:03:02.810> far<00:03:03.050> up<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:04.040> wouldn't<00:03:04.310> be<00:03:04.370> able<00:03:04.460> to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
keep this on your lap it would and I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.020 
keep this on your lap it would and I
would<00:03:06.470> say<00:03:06.800> if<00:03:06.980> you're<00:03:07.130> using<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.970> a

it's<00:03:41.690> inside<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:43.660> bad<00:03:44.660> thing<00:03:44.870> about<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.530> I

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
it's inside the bad thing about it is I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.960 
it's inside the bad thing about it is I
don't<00:03:45.950> know<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.130> you'll<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.400> able<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.580> see<00:03:46.790> this

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
don't know if you'll be able to see this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.080 
don't know if you'll be able to see this
so<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.930> good<00:03:48.140> angle<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:49.760> doesn't

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
so you can get a good angle it doesn't

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.300 
so you can get a good angle it doesn't
really<00:03:50.150> fit<00:03:50.510> too<00:03:50.840> well<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.410> while<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.950> cutouts

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
really fit too well so while the cutouts

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.120 
really fit too well so while the cutouts
align<00:03:52.700> notice<00:03:53.420> how<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.750> kinda<00:03:54.050> is<00:03:54.110> pudgy<00:03:54.380> you

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
align notice how it kinda is pudgy you

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.060 
align notice how it kinda is pudgy you
know<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:55.640> like<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:56.060> bad<00:03:56.540> suit<00:03:56.959> where<00:03:57.320> you<00:03:57.860> had

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070
