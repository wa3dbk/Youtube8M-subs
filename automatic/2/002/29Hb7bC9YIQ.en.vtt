one day to complete basically so my
first<00:00:29.670> tip<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.539> planning<00:00:31.500> assignments<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
first tip for planning assignments is to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
first tip for planning assignments is to
use<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.640> assignment<00:00:33.030> planner<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.660> gonna

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
use an assignment planner and I'm gonna

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.500 
use an assignment planner and I'm gonna
link<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.800> down<00:00:35.040> below<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.520> did<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.969> word

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
link one down below that I did on word

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
link one down below that I did on word
but<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:38.969> planner

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
but you can also do it in your planner

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
but you can also do it in your planner

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that's what I usually do I put it in a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
that's what I usually do I put it in a
note<00:00:41.370> section<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> end<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.379> write

complete the assignment every step when

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
complete the assignment every step when
you<00:01:09.869> work<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.229> assignment<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.250> start

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you work on an assignment is just start

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
you work on an assignment is just start
as<00:01:11.610> early<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.939> possible<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.750> soon<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
as early as possible so as soon as you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.960 
as early as possible so as soon as you
get<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> instructions<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.580> working

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
get all the instructions start working

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.249 
get all the instructions start working
on<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> don't<00:01:15.479> wait<00:01:15.600> until<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> last<00:01:15.960> minute

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
on and don't wait until the last minute

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.050 
on and don't wait until the last minute
and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.650> everyone<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> saying<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.700> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and I know everyone is saying that but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
and I know everyone is saying that but
everyone<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> procrastinating<00:01:19.140> anyways<00:01:19.490> but

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
everyone is procrastinating anyways but

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.539 
everyone is procrastinating anyways but
it's<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.810> maybe<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.770> repeat<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.189> enough

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it's like maybe if we repeat it enough

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's like maybe if we repeat it enough
sometimes<00:01:24.360> we're<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.900> able<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
sometimes we're gonna be able to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.160 
sometimes we're gonna be able to
actually<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.830> start<00:01:26.130> early<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> assignments

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
actually like start early on assignments

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
actually like start early on assignments
because<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.860> earlier<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> start<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.909> better

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
because the earlier you start the better

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
because the earlier you start the better
quality<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> end<00:01:31.770> because

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
quality it's gonna be at the end because

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
quality it's gonna be at the end because
you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:33.090> time<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> work<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you have more time to work on it and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.010 
you have more time to work on it and
perfection<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> yeah<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
perfection it so yeah I'm just going to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
perfection it so yeah I'm just going to
show<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> how<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> plan<00:01:37.710> backwards<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
show you how to plan backwards if you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.380 
show you how to plan backwards if you
have<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.689> big<00:01:40.049> project<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.829> due<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
have a big project that's due on a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
have a big project that's due on a
specific<00:01:42.630> date<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> plan

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
specific date and then like how to plan

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
specific date and then like how to plan
backwards<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> start<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
backwards so you know when to start and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
backwards so you know when to start and
get<00:01:47.460> everything<00:01:47.729> done<00:01:47.880> directly<00:01:48.770> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
get everything done directly so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
get everything done directly so
obviously<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> steps<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.030> be

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
obviously like the steps are gonna be

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
obviously like the steps are gonna be
different<00:01:51.570> depending<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
different depending on what kind of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
different depending on what kind of
assignment<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.640> let's<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.090> think

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
assignment you have but let's just think

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270 
assignment you have but let's just think
this<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:54.960> example<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.100> write

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this one is an example so you just write

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
this one is an example so you just write
the<00:01:56.460> due<00:01:56.610> date<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.110> always<00:01:58.229> give

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the due date down then I always give

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.280 
the due date down then I always give
myself<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:59.399> or<00:01:59.549> three<00:01:59.790> days<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.509> finish<00:02:01.140> early

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
myself two or three days to finish early

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.469 
myself two or three days to finish early
so<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.759> stress<00:02:03.030> about<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so I can like not stress about it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.950 
so I can like not stress about it
then<00:02:04.020> two<00:02:04.259> days<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.920> revise<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
then two days to revise and then you can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
then two days to revise and then you can
add<00:02:07.259> two<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:07.740> three<00:02:07.770> days<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> write<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
add two or three days to write the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
add two or three days to write the
assignment<00:02:09.479> depending<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:10.709> length

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
assignment depending on the what length

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.730 
assignment depending on the what length
it<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:12.000> if

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
it is then if

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.930 
it is then if
few<00:02:12.860> days<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:14.830> organize<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.250> outline<00:02:16.670> and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
few days to organize the outline and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.570 
few days to organize the outline and
stuff<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.830> after<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.010> want<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
stuff like that after that you want the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.510 
stuff like that after that you want the
whole<00:02:19.790> day<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> gather<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.350> information<00:02:21.520> you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
whole day to gather the information you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.410 
whole day to gather the information you
have<00:02:23.060> read<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.620> give<00:02:25.130> myself<00:02:25.340> 5<00:02:25.790> days<00:02:26.090> to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
have read then I give myself 5 days to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.790 
have read then I give myself 5 days to
read<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> material<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.380> really<00:02:27.470> depends

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
read the material but it really depends

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.170 
read the material but it really depends
on<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.130> kind<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.370> material<00:02:28.760> we're<00:02:28.910> talking

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
on what kind of material we're talking

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.660 
on what kind of material we're talking
about<00:02:29.270> right<00:02:29.860> Pinero<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:31.430> want

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
about right Pinero because I really want

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.130 
about right Pinero because I really want
to<00:02:31.760> emphasize<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.480> spreading<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.020> the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
to emphasize on spreading out the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.200 
to emphasize on spreading out the
readings<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.310> use<00:02:34.880> all<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
readings but you have to use all the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.660 
readings but you have to use all the
days<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.600> available<00:02:36.140> every<00:02:36.740> time<00:02:36.920> then

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
days you have available every time then

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.940 
days you have available every time then
the<00:02:37.970> day<00:02:38.420> before<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:39.050> just<00:02:39.320> gather<00:02:39.470> these
