 I will not tell you much for a long time 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.430
 theories as well I will not show you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.970

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 that you people are busy and show you the most 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.699
 necessary exercises that should be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.570
 do before each workout before 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.729
 every workout 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.879
 no need to wait pierced something sore 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:53.430
 you start to look for what to do what 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.339
 do there most cases will 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.710
 it was written to do warm up 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.019
 so I really hope that you are now 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.699
 Stay and Stage When You Have Nothing 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.549
 hurts you just start or 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.159
 continue your training therefore 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 today talk about the necessary 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.280
 the most necessary exercises we begin 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 warm up with easy running 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.550
 two or three minutes, we offer our 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 rises and our body warms up 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.260
 then from top to bottom we start doing 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.870
 exercise first cervical vertebra 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:36.740
 cervical vertebrae 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.740
 simplified and she barely temku about 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:56.100
 move to hands brush relaxed 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:59.400
 start one way then the other elbows 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:09.110
 arms relaxed and so hang 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:09.110
 and start one way and the other 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.270
 shoulders very important from running i first 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.810
 it seems why do it but shoulders arms 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.370
 elbows generally arms in general thats all 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.420
 this is all should be as much as possible 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.200
 relaxed when you keep 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.090
 I have when I ran for two years 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.770
 now he began to train with a trainer 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.380
 he did not say having seen the previous and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:46.250
 scream and that is it turns out I spend 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.320
 so much energy so we do and for 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.160
 this we do this markup 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.160
 so the shoulders case 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.370
 trunov 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.750
 in this 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.100
 stunned 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:34.969
 you can even feel help too 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 maximally they were placed those 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:47.109
 we turn corps one way and in 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.109
 another 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.620
 And so the favorite male exercise 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:04.730
 rotate your ass in one direction so that 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.030
 stretch our long behind joint and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.030
 then another 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.890
 go to the deer lap chief 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.000
 the shock absorber we have when we 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.090
 we run a shock account and not first on 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.460
 lap then this is tying the joints 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.040
 so, too, we knead them put legs 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:38.490
 together 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.490
 rotate in one direction and in the other 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.560
 put your feet shoulder-width apart 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.750
 one way or the other 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:07.660
 and finish the ankles we 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:12.680
 do it either air on one side 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:15.100
 or another or do it just like that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.100
 here's a leg 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.140
 one side 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.310
 well now we are all ready yet of course 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:37.010
 very good for 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:39.490
 and even legs stand up hold back 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.490
 straight 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.340
 as much as possible back and pull it out too 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.340
 leg relaxed 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.000
 first one 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.250
 that's all 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:11.890
 just a few minutes our joint 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:15.520
 joint ready for loading and this 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:20.140
 exercise these exercises do not guarantee 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.840

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.510

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:30.870
