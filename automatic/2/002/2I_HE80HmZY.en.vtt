00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.240
 hello welcome to this new video 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.820
 where are we going to learn to calculate a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.789
 square root the first thing we will have 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.580
 what to do when calculating a root is to put 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.449
 the number separating it into blocks of two 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.449
 in two numbers 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 11 63 and 26 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 once we have it separated with the 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 first block in this case 11 we have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 than looking for a number that raised 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.010
 square is the closest to 11 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.530
 without going for example 3 squared is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.649
 equal to 9 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 4 squared equals 16 on 4 already 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 it happens to us so we will stay with the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 3 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 s 3 we write here and now 3 to 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.600
 square 9 we put it here below and the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.329
 we're 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.840
 and is 2 and once we have done that 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.310
 we go down the next block 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 that would be 63 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.810
 now on the right side we have 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.810
 to lower twice the number 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.700
 and now we will look for a number 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.979
 in such a way 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:31.130
 that sixty something for that something is us 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:38.700
 approximate to 263 we are going to look for him 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:44.680
 63 by 3 are 3 by 3 9 and 6 by 3 18 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.760
 64 for 4 is 4 for 4 16 took me 14 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:54.670
 possibly 4 and a 25 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 65 x 55 x 525 5 x 6 32 that brings me to 32 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:03.520
 the number we are looking for is a 4 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:09.630
 therefore we put him because 64 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.630
 by 4 equals 256 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.890
 we go up to that 4 and we subtract here 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.340
 7 and we have finally got off the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.340
 last block that are 726 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.920
 we go back down twice as many as 34 are 68 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:41.549
 with which we will now look for another number 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:47.170
 in such a way that 680 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:50.739
 680 and something for that something comes to us 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.980
 to 726 in this case it's easy because it 's 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.980
 one 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:09.620
 we climbed the 1 681 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.620
 for one equal to 680 thousand 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.750
 and we are about six is ​​five of 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.000
 eight data is four and I'm about 45 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.000
 the root would be solved 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.260
 As you can see, it's not very complicated and it's 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.940
 the way the roots are resolved 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.770
 square let's see another example 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.380
 we calculate now this other root 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.240
 we write it again separating from two 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.240
 in two there would always be 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.900
 and here we see that in the first block 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.580
 things that have only a number left 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.580
 the procedure is the same 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.850
 2 squared is 43 squared is a 9 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.090
 with the 3 already happened to me with which I put the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.269
 two 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.040
 and 2 squared are four I do the subtraction 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.430
 and I have four left and under the next 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430
 block 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.990
 now under 4 and I'm looking for a number 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.420
 in such a way that forty-something 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.799
 that something approached me the most 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.799
 possible to 432 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.230
 I will try directly with the 9 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:41.320
 49 for 999 81 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:44.050
 9 x 4 are 36 and 8 44 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.570
 here we see that we went through so much 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.570
 we have to put 48 by 8 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.810
 8 x 8 are 64 I take 6 and 8 x 4 32 and 6 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.810
 38 384 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:10.330
 we put the 8 by 8 are 384 and we upload 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.330
 here and here we subtract 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.660
 from 4 to 2 are eight I got 18 plus 193 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.490
 are 4 10 and now we have already come down last 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.440
 block that is 25 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.440
 twice 28 56 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.590
 we are looking for a number here 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:39.289
 in such a way that 50 560 and something for something 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:43.059
 whatever comes closest to 4 1825 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.059
 and we approve again with 9 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:53.320
 nine times nine is 81 I get 8 9 for 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:59.100
 6 54 8 62 I take 6 9 for 5 45 and 6 are 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:04.900
 51 with the 9 passed me we tried with the 8 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:12.060
 568 for 8 8 for 8 is 64 I'm taking 6 8 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:14.240
 for 6 48 and 654 I take 5 8 for 5 40 45 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:20.870
 is the one that counts 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:26.029
 568 by 8 that is equal to 4 thousand 544 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.029
 we go back up the 8 and here the states 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:35.969
 1 of 4 to 28 and it took me 168 2 281 this is 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.490
 the rest is already done the division 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:41.620
 the square root forgiveness 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.560
 this is all for now 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.900
