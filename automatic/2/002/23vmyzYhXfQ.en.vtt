00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.389
 so much stuff 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:28.680
 today's episode is dedicated to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:30.179
 students as it does but why take it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.449
 to make the dotted line of the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.449
 highways 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:53.670
 not bad but hypnotized guys I have 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 understood how this is done but think that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:13.820
 comfort and move the furniture in that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:13.820
 to heavy this 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.500
 here then we do not complain if in class 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.500
 there is someone who takes notes like this 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 of course 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.819
 then guys I understand giving bags 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.140
 in short, to make it possible 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.530
 I also study for people who don't 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 they have economic faculties, but shit 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 then they must be supported and that is two pennies 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.049
 even for the slight hardware we have to give 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.790
 which then I wondered how it started 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.200
 century that is when there was no computer 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.730
 and took notes all with the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.989
 machines to write what goes by 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.950

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:40.790

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.500
 fuck it then happens that some 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.500

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.490
