00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 please be a legal mashup file 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.840
 help me get a little 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.679
 do not the Greeks 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.779
 I do not know what I'm going to do with this 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 damned animal what is it that is 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.939
 trying to make beloved cantinflas 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.520
 Well, I have to bring water or a garden like that 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.360
 I'm going to build a small river but 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.510
 this goat waits for where your river is born 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.880
 where is born sir I only know that I have 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.340
 that make a little noise all the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.470
 rivers have a place where they are born and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.830
 then they are fed by streams 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.350
 other rivers and the rainwater the 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.080
 loma is not that here it does not rain much like 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.150
 so that my river is born remember that 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.250
 many rivers are born thousands of kilometers 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.490
 like the amazon 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 I assure you, it's a huge river 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.890
 I would very much like to see a river like that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.860
 we can fix it imagine that golden 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 has wings and tail like an airplane 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.990
 fantastic as if it were an object 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.230
 Flying so now climb and imagine 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.310
 that actually flies to godito I hope 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.440
 that my imagination will not fail me 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.640
 do not worry, my friend, I will be your guide 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.070
 we will fly south of the equator 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.740
 or as they taught me in the equator 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.650
 it is very hot is not true 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.909
 that's the way you're not wrong but 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.070
 let's take a look 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.530
 this is the mouth of the great 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.630
 amazonas in the atlantic ocean has 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 more than 11 kilometers wide and 60 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.650
 meters deep 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.190
 it carries more water than the Mississippi and 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.200
 louisiana together and that they are huge the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.300
 amazonas receives water from five countries 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.310
 brazil guayana colombia ecuador and peru 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.640
 hear and all that heap of water move to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.350
 Atlantic ocean yes and realize that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.130
 the place where he is born is a few 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.409
 miles of the Pacific Ocean 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 I do not know in the Andean mountain range in Peru 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.130
 and travel more than 6 thousand kilometers to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.470
 reach the atlantic ocean 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.350
 let's start our study of the amazon 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.060
 from here some small river boats 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.190
 they travel through these places 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.989
 hear it 's death site is very nice 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.630
 but that we could not take better a 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.880
 bus in this part of Peru not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.550
 it's too rugged here there are no roads 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.640
 everything is transported by the river and where 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.040
 is all the people sir is in the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.590
 towns and cities look there is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 iquitos a population of 40 thousand people 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 It is a port of Peru to export 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.160
 jungle products here are marked 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.069
 minerals and agricultural products that go 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.430
 to Brazil and other points of the world jose 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.080
 this river so it's really important 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.670
 It serves many people and for many things 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.380
 is the main river in South America in 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.960
 1541 an explorer 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.240
 Francisco Orellana discovered one of the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.480
 Amazon tributary rivers after 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.459
 have crossed the before 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.799
 during his journey the explorers 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.590
 They were attacked by indigenous groups 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.959
 that included many female warriors 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.849
 the Spaniards called her amazonas for 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.890
 the Greek legend that spoke of women 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.129
 warriors, I hope we do not meet 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.470
 with those old freaks, mister miren 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.290
 more there seems to be a lot of rivers 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.510
 young yes and more than 200 of them give their 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.730
 waters to the amazonas but five are so 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.310
 big that huge ships cross them 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.640
 for thousands of kilometers 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.920
 but I think this is new 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.170
 If it rains a lot here, this is one of the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.030
 great centers of the world 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.000
 captures more rain than any other 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.730
 region of its same size on the planet 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.010
 look at the docks and houseboats the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.130
 heavy rain makes the river rise and 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.000
 flood all from November to May 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.070
 we will put speed to show you 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.740
 hear it seems that the river also squeezes 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.780
 the step like this is usually slow 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.820
 runs at two and a half kilometers per hour 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.569
 but it doubles its speed during the era 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.719
 rainy 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.639
 I'm sorry friend is that the amazon 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.220
 rises from 10 to 15 meters during the 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.120
 rainy season but that does not affect 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.600
 to navigation 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.100
 but it affects my head can not see 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.100
 the other bank of the river 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.940
 if there is no other shore 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.650
 disappearance not friend this river is so 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.280
 wide that in some places you do not achieve 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.010
 see the shores 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.860
 and now it looks more like a lake this network 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.840
 of calmed if your current to the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.990
 Atlantic is incredibly slow is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.330
 almost zero this river in the middle lazy not 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.789
 believe 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.789
 what is this a locomotive not 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.120
 it seems that the river lives upside down 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.070
 the tide causes a wave 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.990
 near the Atlantic 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.480
 this effect of the tide on the river that 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.470
 runs so slowly causes what they call a 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.780
 bowl 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.670
 I think it's more like a tree where 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 the pilots of the river know the schedules 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.340
 of these waves but for the first 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.040
 explorers was a great danger 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.010
 Well, this exploration has been the most 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.840
 heifers gentlemen but for my part I 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.460
 I think I've seen everything that has 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.600
 the river of the amazons sir 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.600
 thank you very much 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.770
 what father are we already the return my 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.770
 mom yes 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.810
 good for what I see you already have your 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.930
 Amazon small river or I already have it and 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.270
 is running very well 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.310
 but what is your source where it brings the 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.990
 water beyond that barrel 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.389
 I hope that he is damned goat is not 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.350
 finish all because it is always good if 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.350
 well is the condemned
