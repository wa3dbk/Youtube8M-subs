hello sis free here again today I'm
going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.920> show<00:00:08.100> you<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.460> make<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.969> sound

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
going to show you how to make a sound

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.980 
going to show you how to make a sound
wave<00:00:09.870> machine<00:00:10.820> if<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.150> watch<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.389> slap<00:00:12.780> shot

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
wave machine if you watch my slap shot

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.010 
wave machine if you watch my slap shot
video<00:00:13.199> you'll<00:00:13.350> have<00:00:13.469> seen<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.010> action<00:00:15.020> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
video you'll have seen this in action so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
video you'll have seen this in action so
and<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.119> run<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.330> thing<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.840> so

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and it's going to run the thing here so

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.390 
and it's going to run the thing here so
it's<00:00:19.140> got<00:00:19.289> nice<00:00:19.410> little<00:00:19.710> clock<00:00:19.920> let's<00:00:20.310> just

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's got nice little clock let's just

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.210 
it's got nice little clock let's just
turn<00:00:20.759> that<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.179> and<00:00:21.890> if<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.009> watch

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
turn that on and if you just watch

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.560 
turn that on and if you just watch
carefully<00:00:25.220> go<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> Sun<00:00:27.289> then<00:00:28.289> comes<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> sand

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
carefully go the Sun then comes the sand

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
carefully go the Sun then comes the sand
and<00:00:30.570> back<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.529> again<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:34.579> turn<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and back up again and so on turn that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.510 
and back up again and so on turn that
off<00:00:36.440> there<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> uses<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.110> new

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
off there we go so this uses the new

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.349 
off there we go so this uses the new
features<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.449> a<00:00:43.760> while<00:00:44.760> my<00:00:44.940> brain<00:00:45.180> gone

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
features of the a while my brain gone

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.709 
features of the a while my brain gone
blank<00:00:46.010> slime<00:00:47.010> block<00:00:47.250> that's<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> wasn't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
blank slime block that's the one wasn't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.349 
blank slime block that's the one wasn't
wearing<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:48.989> moment<00:00:49.199> there<00:00:49.730> in<00:00:50.730> fact<00:00:51.120> that

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
wearing for moment there in fact that

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.959 
wearing for moment there in fact that
you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> push<00:00:51.870> NTS<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.370> includes<00:00:53.760> like

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you can push NTS up this includes like

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.529 
you can push NTS up this includes like
players<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:55.440> items<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.579> also<00:00:56.730> sound<00:00:57.210> when

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
players and items but also sound when

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
players and items but also sound when
it's<00:00:57.660> falling<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> an<00:00:58.559> entity<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it's falling is an entity so if you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
it's falling is an entity so if you
capture<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.190> still<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
capture the right time it will still be

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.829 
capture the right time it will still be
an<00:01:02.609> entity<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.269> launch<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.719> an

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
an entity and you can launch it up an

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.610 
an entity and you can launch it up an
air<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.810> basically<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.350> this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
air so that's basically how this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.890 
air so that's basically how this
principle<00:01:08.070> works<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.970> launched<00:01:09.480> it<00:01:09.750> up

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
principle works so these launched it up

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.550 
principle works so these launched it up
and<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> force<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.840> launching<00:01:13.410> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and the force of that launching is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.190 
and the force of that launching is
enough<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.190> about<00:01:14.370> here<00:01:14.900> which<00:01:15.900> these

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
enough to take it about here which these

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.650 
enough to take it about here which these
come<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.130> land<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.180> working

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
come out and the land and then working

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.480 
come out and the land and then working
with<00:01:18.840> verities<00:01:19.470> pull<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.250> falls

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with verities pull out and it just falls

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
with verities pull out and it just falls
back<00:01:20.760> onto<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> we're<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> just

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
back onto them so we're going to just

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
back onto them so we're going to just
build<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.430> single<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:23.970> they're<00:01:24.240> fairly<00:01:24.480> easy

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
build a single one they're fairly easy

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.540 
build a single one they're fairly easy
build<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.440> don't<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.400> from

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
build I don't know if you can see from

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.930 
build I don't know if you can see from
there<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.830> billed<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.160> here<00:01:29.610> just

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
there but what is billed on here just

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.400 
there but what is billed on here just
fin<00:01:30.180> range<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.660> i<00:01:30.690> can<00:01:30.840> actually<00:01:31.080> see<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.320> i'm

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
fin range so i can actually see what i'm

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.700 
fin range so i can actually see what i'm
doing<00:01:31.440> is<00:01:31.830> well<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> we'll<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> bottom

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
doing is well so we'll get the bottom

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.750 
doing is well so we'll get the bottom
done<00:01:34.920> first<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.720> need<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.760> sticky

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
done first so we need to get the sticky

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.140 
done first so we need to get the sticky
pistons<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.480> place<00:01:40.580> that's<00:01:41.580> our<00:01:41.820> launch

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
pistons in place that's our launch

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.340 
pistons in place that's our launch
mechanism<00:01:43.910> couple<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:44.970> repeaters<00:01:45.300> now<00:01:45.900> this

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
mechanism couple of repeaters now this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
mechanism couple of repeaters now this
one's<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:46.920> four<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> one's<00:01:47.820> too

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
one's set on four and that one's too

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.590 
one's set on four and that one's too
adds<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.170> give<00:01:49.320> us<00:01:49.470> enough<00:01:49.920> delay<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
adds to give us enough delay and the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.070 
adds to give us enough delay and the
signal<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.910> hearsay<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.720> button<00:01:54.960> was

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
signal so the hearsay if this button was

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.710 
signal so the hearsay if this button was
pressed<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:56.580> turns<00:01:56.880> off<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> tick<00:01:57.480> that

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
pressed that turns off in a tick that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.860 
pressed that turns off in a tick that
falls<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.100> goes<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.970> six<00:02:00.510> which

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
falls and in out goes off in six which

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.900 
falls and in out goes off in six which
is<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.170> enough<00:02:01.350> time<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.820> an

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
is just enough time for this on to be an

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.240 
is just enough time for this on to be an
entity<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.420> hit<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.870> be<00:02:03.990> launched

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
entity and hit it and be launched

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.910 
entity and hit it and be launched
if<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.150> get<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.450> timing<00:02:06.870> wrong<00:02:07.050> then<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
if you get that timing wrong then it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
if you get that timing wrong then it
will<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.130> sort<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> land<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.149> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
will just sort of land on it and it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.270 
will just sort of land on it and it
won't<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:09.539> anywhere<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> they're<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.810> there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
won't go anywhere so they're on there

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.400 
won't go anywhere so they're on there
now<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.850> ourselves<00:02:15.000> another<00:02:15.540> block<00:02:15.960> just

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
now we get ourselves another block just

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.690 
now we get ourselves another block just
above<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.880> put<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> button<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
above here and put a button on it so you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580 
above here and put a button on it so you
can<00:02:20.820> see<00:02:20.940> press<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.300> button<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
can see press a button and that's the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.060 
can see press a button and that's the
timing<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> torch<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.890> so

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
timing if you get a torch up here so

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.400 
timing if you get a torch up here so
that<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.370> piston<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.150> constantly<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:30.410> here

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that the piston is constantly out here

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.130 
that the piston is constantly out here
we<00:02:31.470> go<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:32.580> put<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> block<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.420> now

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
we go and just put a block on there now

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.710 
we go and just put a block on there now
push<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.709> button<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.180> goes<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.570> goes

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
push a button that goes then that goes

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.210 
push a button that goes then that goes
like<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:39.630> sequence<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.100> use

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
like that in sequence you do have to use

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890 
like that in sequence you do have to use
a<00:02:41.250> stone<00:02:41.580> button<00:02:41.970> its<00:02:42.150> design<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
a stone button its design if you have a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930 
a stone button its design if you have a
wooden<00:02:43.230> button<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.709> does<00:02:44.070> tend<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.520> screw<00:02:44.820> up

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
wooden button it does tend to screw up

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.920 
wooden button it does tend to screw up
because<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.810> button<00:02:46.470> press<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:47.010> too<00:02:47.550> long

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
because the button press is too long

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.110 
because the button press is too long
compared<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.050> someone<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.850> from<00:02:51.090> here

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
compared to someone and then from here

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.000 
compared to someone and then from here
we<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.480> need<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> signal<00:02:52.380> up<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
we just need to take the signal up so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.250 
we just need to take the signal up so
bit<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.580> dust<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> top<00:02:54.360> here<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:54.959> let's<00:02:55.110> see

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
bit of dust on the top here so let's see

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.620 
bit of dust on the top here so let's see
multi-directional<00:02:55.770> one<00:02:56.370> or<00:02:56.630> omnidirectional

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
multi-directional one or omnidirectional

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.620 
multi-directional one or omnidirectional
whichever<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.410> which<00:02:59.010> will<00:02:59.310> cause<00:02:59.630> this

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
whichever you want which will cause this

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
whichever you want which will cause this
torch<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.050> turn<00:03:01.200> off<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:01.980> realized

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
torch to turn off and I just realized

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.910 
torch to turn off and I just realized
this<00:03:02.550> Sun<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.970> setting<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.510> forgot<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.020> stop

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
this Sun is setting you forgot to stop

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.009 
this Sun is setting you forgot to stop
it<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.250> world<00:03:06.200> nope<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.600> torch<00:03:09.870> is

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
it in this world nope so that torch is

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.840 
it in this world nope so that torch is
off<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.709> we're<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:10.890> building<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.310> torch<00:03:11.549> tower

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
off so we're just building a torch tower

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.600 
off so we're just building a torch tower
and<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:13.049> view<00:03:13.290> every<00:03:13.739> one<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.010> these<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.340> adding

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and a view every one of these is adding

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.400 
and a view every one of these is adding
one<00:03:14.760> redstone<00:03:15.000> tick<00:03:15.480> delays<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.989> turns<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
one redstone tick delays it turns on and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.560 
one redstone tick delays it turns on and
off<00:03:17.209> another<00:03:18.209> tourists<00:03:18.660> there<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:21.390> block

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
off another tourists there and a block

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
off another tourists there and a block
there<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.500> should<00:03:22.650> put<00:03:22.799> dust<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.530> we

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
there we should put dust on and then we

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.110 
there we should put dust on and then we
power<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:25.950> does<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.519> by<00:03:26.610> putting<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.910> block

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
power that does just by putting a block

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.170 
power that does just by putting a block
on<00:03:27.299> here<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.549> simply<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> case<00:03:30.120> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
on here and then it's simply a case of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.500 
on here and then it's simply a case of
that<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:30.840> up<00:03:30.930> there<00:03:31.670> now<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.730> sticky<00:03:33.090> piston

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that one up there now the sticky piston

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.840 
that one up there now the sticky piston
which<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.870> being<00:03:34.049> powered<00:03:34.290> by<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.950> block<00:03:35.660> and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
which is being powered by that block and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.150 
which is being powered by that block and
lock<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.070> you

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
lock on there and that's it and then you

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.990 
lock on there and that's it and then you
just<00:03:41.310> take<00:03:41.489> your<00:03:41.610> son<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.450> sound<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.989> there

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
just take your son you sound on there

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.500 
just take your son you sound on there
press<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.090> bun<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.709> goes<00:03:47.209> because<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.360> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
press the bun if it goes because of the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.539 
press the bun if it goes because of the
delay<00:03:48.630> timings<00:03:49.260> well<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.769> says<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.250> will<00:03:50.340> mess

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
delay timings well it says it will mess

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.210 
delay timings well it says it will mess
these<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> way<00:03:51.209> up<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.680> then<00:03:52.680> before<00:03:52.980> it

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
these on the way up and then before it

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.810 
these on the way up and then before it
lands<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.850> pops<00:03:54.090> out<00:03:55.549> usually<00:03:56.549> if<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.700> get

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
lands that pops out usually if you get

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.910 
lands that pops out usually if you get
lag<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.390> will<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.200> fall<00:03:58.410> off<00:03:58.560> but

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
lag it will get it and fall off but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.850 
lag it will get it and fall off but
that's<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.880> live<00:04:00.060> thing<00:04:00.110> Press<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.140> and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.819 

see<00:04:04.860> that's<00:04:05.100> what<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.250> mean<00:04:05.310> about<00:04:05.430> lag<00:04:05.820> thing<00:04:06.150> a

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
see that's what I mean about lag thing a

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.330 
see that's what I mean about lag thing a
couple<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:08.040> read<00:04:08.519> some<00:04:08.790> bugs<00:04:09.120> at<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.810> moment

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
couple of read some bugs at the moment

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.830 
couple of read some bugs at the moment
so<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> should<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:11.940> been<00:04:11.970> n<00:04:12.209> longer<00:04:12.570> let's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
so that should have been n longer let's

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.230 
so that should have been n longer let's
try<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.110> again

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
try that again

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:24.010 
try that again
make<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:19.250> up<00:04:19.459> again<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:22.630> then<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.810> just

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
make up and up again and then you just

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.650 
make up and up again and then you just
build<00:04:24.290> one<00:04:24.650> after<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.430> other<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.850> it's

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
build one after the other and it's

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.350 
build one after the other and it's
simply<00:04:26.900> case<00:04:27.170> of<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.560> repeater<00:04:27.950> between<00:04:28.940> these
