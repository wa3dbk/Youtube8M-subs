00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 And, well , we're going to make it worse now. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 dell inspiron review 14 54 23 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.029
 only then come only to realize the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.920
 That's a good ending, right now. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.510
 cool zinho line to Spain not 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 was considered ultrabook now by 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.740
 some reason he is not anymore 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.820
 precisely because it has the dvd also 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.129
 is not common in ultrabooks that have to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.739
 have a certain level of energy consumption 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.940
 yes it is a specific standard for intel 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.280
 well boring 14 rightly but a little 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.120
 heavy as a normal notebook 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.000
 there the entries on the internet hdmi and usb 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 protected with a cap and my plate 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 there was the air intake of the other 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 sd input side 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.259
 the headset with the microphone and more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:21.030
 of 3.0 also dvd burner which in 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.200
 my opinion is not useless today or 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 in the cloud is growing today you are there 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.369
 because in his specifications then 20 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.659
 if you want to change the good battery 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 Only you have to open the computer. 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.610
 to change the battery because it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.650
 beats that hunting and more different than 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.450
 our last review he has a cap 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.090
 down there to change the ram memories 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 You need it but the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 finishing it closer to a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.340
 likely a beat risquinho 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.049
 strong and play this match and painted 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.469
 of plastic around the aluminum she 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.200
 easy win even in our 14r he 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.600
 also easily scratched at a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 bit of his storage it comes 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.599
 with 32 gigs ssd plus 500 gigabytes of HD and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 it is by default you do not put 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.140
 It messes with nothing but by default it comes 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.730
 using 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 the wrong this business that the people 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.090
 conversation and another time keyboard is fine 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.680
 comfortable and half chewing gum is 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.200
 different from other computer respect 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.800
 It would look in the ok chapter, which is very useful. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.780
 huh 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.130
 a lot but he is very soft and silent 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 It's a bit complicated for our 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:41.489
 basic lighting here but there 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 enough ipad functions when you 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.190
 block for you, you got retarded 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.380
 trying until depression is broken 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.800
 It's like frequency interference. 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.130
 in the filming but this is the camera people 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.739
 until it is not so ok please 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.860
 his battery has a very good duration 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:07.140
 also because 14r based is also is the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.410
 good materialization is around a few 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.570
 three hours in a very nice and if you 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.550
 use a pretty way give a five 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.040
 of these three options 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.140
 configurable are actually up to kilts 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.470
 internal configuration a notebook one 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.500
 software on her own that is not 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.030
 set up in April first manufacturing 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.010
 year it comes with windows 8 also more pro 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.130
 obvious reasons again and put the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.769
 windows 7 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.519
 there a little in his evaluation not yet 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.090
 appeared 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:56.489
 it came with 17 8 gb of ram and 64 bit 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 nor angels' standard, hence the 500 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.870
 get out of the ordinary 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:08.850
 it is on this computer that it was not installed 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:11.130
 no ssd endorsement because I only saw this 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.970
 after it as it sees by default in the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.420
 cash 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.150
 there did not have to be standing there but a 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.640
 formatting will be even a bit more 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.660
 his finish what beautiful 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.580
 even for those who like more beautiful with 14 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.129
 It's that giant thing . 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.939
 a battery always with the rope going out 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:36.270
 the keyboard door is well separated not 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:38.430
 It's difficult to type and now I'm going to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.949
 of his sound which is one of the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.870
 differential of this number of ads 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.770
 bug ads ads from 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.770
 free advertisement 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.340
 It's more money to show the sound. 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.439
 this is it people see themselves in the next video 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:05.099
 I hope you have enjoyed any 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:08.330
 You can send in questions and 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.729
 comments we like enough 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.860
 Now you've been asked too long. 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.199
 they asked before because many 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.740
 times the name of your time and also 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.240
 you ask before that a 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.520
 I hug you all the way to the next video. 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.159

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.699
 details on the website promises to have a 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:32.569
 this access and that's it 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.569
 Hugs to you
