00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:04.125
 We are waiting ... 

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:09.647
 of the grand final of the national competition of the Best Sommelier of Chile ... 

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:13.392
 I'm calm, confident that we've done a good job ... 

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.228
 ... we hope to reach the final 

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:21.642
 and if God wants, and everything goes well, win ... win the champions 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.211
 So, with that spirit and confidence 

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.360
 the participants waited for the names of the three finalists ... 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.321
 ... of the Best Sommelier competition in Chile 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 Andrés Roseberg, presented aloud in the hall full of spectators 

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:35.500
 number 2 

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.689
 the number: 5 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.359
 and the number: 17 

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:55.688
 presented the finalists 

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.664
 the public and jurors prepare for the first evaluation 

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.590
 Héctor Riquelme, makes his presentation 

00:01:00.883 --> 00:01:04.825
 with an excellent public domain, a lot of knowledge and information 

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:07.025
 complies with a correct presentation 

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.193
 We emphasize his tranquility in the execution of the tests, 

00:01:12.828 --> 00:01:16.953
 With so much adrenaline, ending ... Phew! Passing the nervousness 

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:19.862
 And well ... whatever God wants ... 

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:27.303
 I felt good, taking certain details of time ... but that's good ... it's like this .. 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.226
 ... Andrés Rosberg, who is part of the jury, tells us about the level of candidates ... 

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:36.201
 The level of the songs is very high 

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:40.659
 The candidates are being submitted to a 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.666
 almost because they had to go through many ... many tests, yesterday 

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.858
 Including proof of service, of harmony, of tasting ... 

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:53.498
 And .. good of all this evidence, the best placed 

00:01:53.887 --> 00:01:58.095
 are participating in this final, which as you have seen, is being very demanding 

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:02.207
 Anyway, I'm very ... very satisfied with everything we've seen so far. 

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.209
 Now it's Mareclo Pino's turn 

00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:07.531
 which stands out for its youth and great experience 

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:11.404
 with the title of Master Sommelier of level 1, obtained in Argentina 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.257
 comes to demonstrate their knowledge, before demanding jury 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:20.197
 We highlight in Marecelo its dynamism in communicating with the customer 

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.527
 Eh ... well, actually, what can I say ... I'm very nervous, 

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:28.526
 I think this for me is something new, I had never been in a contest with such pressure ... 

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:32.414
 but everything beautiful, interesting, and after all, but quiet, I'm a little more ... 

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:36.882
 ... eh, absorbing all this energy, I've already released it 

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:42.645
 Juan Samavia, highlighted the skills of the finalists and the initiative of this competition 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.715
 They are different evidence, from knowledge to service, 

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:54.152
 both technical and organoleptic knowledge and description of wines 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.811
 And it seems that to be champion you have to be super gifted 

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:03.853
 So, I congratulate the future champion, and obviously it's a long-term job 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.748
 requires a lot of study, a lot of knowledge, a lot of practice 

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:11.543
 good congratulations to the initiative and great luck for the champions 

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:14.439
 Last time is to see Cristian David 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.360
 who surprised, for being one of the three finalists, 

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:21.698
 and second he commented on us without being so prepared, however, he made a presentation more than honorable 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.401
 We emphasize the courage of standing in front of the jurors, with the surprise of being a finalist 

00:03:27.747 --> 00:03:30.168
 I came in very nervous, because I did not have many expectations 

00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.772
 Where I was very relaxed sitting in the chair, they announced to me, and I trembled 

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:41.641
 Then I see myself up here, where I never imagined myself, and I got very nervous, but then I relaxed a little 

00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:46.039
 but ... tasty, interesting, a valid experience, that is, spectacular! 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.630
 Marcos Silva, regrets the elimination of a candidate who made a mistake in the preliminary stages 

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:53.972
 and that he was very well prepared for this final 

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:59.014
 Patricio Perez: Pay more attention when you are doing such an important test !!! 

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.253
 The truth is that the level of the first two finalists is very similar 

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:06.240
 and the third is much lower 

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:12.307
 regrettably we lost one because we made a mistake in the first phase, and maybe it would have been more equivalent 

00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:13.540
 For now this is everything 

00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:16.770
 Let's go, but keep following us, luck is on the way. 

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:20.874
 and it's a matter of minutes to know who will be the Best sommelier in Chile 

00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:23.601
 We are: EWine - The wine fun
