00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
sort of on the fly in the opening a
situation<00:00:16.590> almost<00:00:16.949> every<00:00:17.400> chess<00:00:17.609> players

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880

time or professionals and I think the

time or professionals and I think the
key<00:00:22.949> when<00:00:23.189> you're<00:00:23.310> trying<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.789> about

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
key when you're trying to think about

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
key when you're trying to think about
what<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> opening<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> keep<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
what to do in the opening is to keep the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
what to do in the opening is to keep the
three<00:00:25.890> main<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.939> opening<00:00:27.330> principles<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.900> mind

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
three main is opening principles in mind

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.410 
three main is opening principles in mind
and<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and that is that first of all all of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240 
and that is that first of all all of
your<00:00:30.900> moves<00:00:31.140> need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.800> judged<00:00:32.070> about

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
your moves need to be judged about

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.620 
your moves need to be judged about
whether<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.820> control<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> center

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
whether or not they control the center

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
whether or not they control the center
these<00:00:34.200> Center<00:00:34.530> four<00:00:34.800> squares<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> most

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
these Center four squares are the most

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
these Center four squares are the most
important<00:00:35.910> squares<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> board<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
important squares on the board because

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.580 
important squares on the board because
any<00:00:38.309> attack<00:00:38.790> will<00:00:39.270> probably<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.870> through<00:00:39.899> some

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
any attack will probably go through some

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.690 
any attack will probably go through some
of<00:00:40.710> these<00:00:40.800> squares<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> player<00:00:41.550> who

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of these squares and the player who

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.750 
of these squares and the player who
controls<00:00:42.079> sort<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> crossroads<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
controls sort of the crossroads of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
controls sort of the crossroads of the
chessboard<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.629> able<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.989> move<00:00:46.559> his<00:00:46.860> his

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
chessboard will be able to move his his

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
chessboard will be able to move his his
or<00:00:47.430> her<00:00:47.550> pieces<00:00:47.760> much<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.300> efficiently<00:00:48.690> than

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
or her pieces much more efficiently than

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
or her pieces much more efficiently than
his<00:00:48.989> opponent<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> opening<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> want

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
his opponent so in the opening you want

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.040 
his opponent so in the opening you want
to<00:00:50.280> work<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> control<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.120> Center<00:00:51.719> squares

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to work to control these Center squares

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
to work to control these Center squares
the<00:00:52.680> next<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the next thing you want to do is to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.189 
the next thing you want to do is to
develop<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.239> pieces<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
develop your pieces you know you want to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
develop your pieces you know you want to
get<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.530> knights<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> bishops<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
get your knights and bishops out and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.490 
get your knights and bishops out and
eventually<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.059> rooks<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.199> Queen

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
eventually your rooks and the Queen

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
eventually your rooks and the Queen
because<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> player<00:00:59.760> with<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.120> pieces<00:01:00.480> out

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
because the player with more pieces out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
because the player with more pieces out
is<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.230> able<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> quickly<00:01:01.739> adapt<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
is going to be able to quickly adapt to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.520 
is going to be able to quickly adapt to
the<00:01:02.520> situation<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.449> attack<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.260> get

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the situation get an attack going get

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
the situation get an attack going get
pressure<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:06.360> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.720> leave

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
pressure so you don't want to just leave

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
pressure so you don't want to just leave
your<00:01:07.080> pieces<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.590> home<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> move<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> same

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
your pieces at home and move the same

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
your pieces at home and move the same
piece<00:01:08.640> over<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> lead

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
piece over and over that's going to lead

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.840 
piece over and over that's going to lead
to<00:01:09.840> major<00:01:10.140> problems<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.280> final<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to major problems and the final thing is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
to major problems and the final thing is
that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> protect<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.260> King<00:01:13.530> now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that you want to protect your King now

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.490 
that you want to protect your King now
that's<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:14.970> obviously<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.200> center

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's because obviously in the center

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.539 
that's because obviously in the center
of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> King<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.250> vulnerable

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of the King can be very vulnerable

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
of the King can be very vulnerable
because<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.900> pawns<00:01:19.140> disappear<00:01:19.860> or

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because if these pawns disappear or

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
because if these pawns disappear or
things<00:01:20.520> break<00:01:20.820> open<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.299> King<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.630> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
things break open the King will be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.200 
things break open the King will be
trapped<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:23.040> opponent<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
trapped and your opponent will get a lot

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.520 
trapped and your opponent will get a lot
of<00:01:24.299> pressure<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> defend<00:01:25.350> your

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
of pressure so you want to defend your

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.679 
of pressure so you want to defend your
King<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> usually<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.820> means<00:01:26.880> castling

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
King and usually that means castling

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
King and usually that means castling
mainly<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.130> castle<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.880> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
mainly because when you castle you know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.789 
mainly because when you castle you know
you<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> rook<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.530> develop

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you get the rook in so you also develop

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
you get the rook in so you also develop
the<00:01:32.070> piece<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> rook<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.850> move<00:01:33.000> towards

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the piece and the rook will move towards

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
the piece and the rook will move towards
the<00:01:33.299> center<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> say<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.220> face<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.759> know

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the center so so say your face you know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.450 
the center so so say your face you know
you're<00:01:36.000> playing<00:01:36.240> black<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.750> haven't<00:01:36.990> seen

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
you're playing black you haven't seen

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
you're playing black you haven't seen
this<00:01:38.460> before<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.060> you're<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.390> opponent

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
this before and you're your opponent

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.410 
this before and you're your opponent
plays<00:01:39.869> c4<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.430> okay<00:01:41.610> well<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
plays c4 so you think okay well it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
plays c4 so you think okay well it
doesn't<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:42.869> seem<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> by<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
doesn't really seem and by the way this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
doesn't really seem and by the way this
is<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.960> English<00:01:45.960> opening<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.680> doesn't<00:01:47.149> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
is the English opening now it doesn't it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
is the English opening now it doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> doesn't<00:01:48.890> develop

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
doesn't you know it doesn't develop

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
doesn't you know it doesn't develop
pieces<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.579> does<00:01:50.729> control<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> center

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
pieces but it does control the center

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
pieces but it does control the center
you<00:01:51.720> know<00:01:51.810> controls<00:01:52.229> d5<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you know controls d5 so it's it's a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.190 
you know controls d5 so it's it's a
wonderful<00:01:54.060> opening<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.990> tryna

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
wonderful opening but I'm just tryna

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
wonderful opening but I'm just tryna
show<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.500> players<00:01:55.770> react<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> first

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
show how players react so the first

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.700 
show how players react so the first
thing<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> need<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.560> move

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
thing you need to do is look for a move

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.899 
thing you need to do is look for a move
that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.310> follows<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> three

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that you know follows the three

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.450 
that you know follows the three
principles<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.189> want<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
principles so you know you don't want to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.709 
principles so you know you don't want to
play<00:02:02.610> something<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> six<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.680> five<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.719> I

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
play something like a six or a five or I

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.020 
play something like a six or a five or I
mean<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> would<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.129> knight<00:02:08.399> c6<00:02:08.610> or

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
mean I would think like knight c6 or

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.420 
mean I would think like knight c6 or
Knight<00:02:09.149> f6<00:02:09.330> while<00:02:09.810> playable<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
Knight f6 while playable from the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
Knight f6 while playable from the
standpoint<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:11.970> we're<00:02:12.120> doing<00:02:12.330> now

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
standpoint of what we're doing now

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.870 
standpoint of what we're doing now
unless

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
unless

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.940 
unless
no<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.090> concrete<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.870> know<00:02:13.900> specific<00:02:14.740> moves

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
no the concrete you know specific moves

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.250 
no the concrete you know specific moves
it's<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.400> as<00:02:15.520> good<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:16.000> something<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.840> e<00:02:17.020> 5

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
it's not as good as something like e 5

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.810 
it's not as good as something like e 5
and<00:02:17.590> that's<00:02:17.800> because<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.280> controls<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
and that's because that controls the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.640 
and that's because that controls the
center<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.240> gets<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> pond<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.810> center<00:02:20.170> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
center it gets a pond in the center you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
center it gets a pond in the center you
know<00:02:20.770> attacks<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.820> d4<00:02:22.240> square<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:23.260> develops

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
know attacks the d4 square it develops

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.140 
know attacks the d4 square it develops
the<00:02:23.860> pieces<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.280> sense<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.730> prepares

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the pieces in the sense of it prepares

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.730 
the pieces in the sense of it prepares
for<00:02:25.480> these<00:02:25.630> beat<00:02:25.810> now<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.050> bishop<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.620> move

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
for these beat now the bishop can move

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.170 
for these beat now the bishop can move
out<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> night<00:02:27.370> game<00:02:27.550> event<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
out and the night game event and the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.630 
out and the night game event and the
Queen<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.680> mean<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.010> could<00:02:30.160> argue<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
Queen and I mean you could argue that it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.390 
Queen and I mean you could argue that it
indirectly<00:02:31.120> defends<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.720> King<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:33.040> he

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
indirectly defends the King because he

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.950 
indirectly defends the King because he
he'll<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.730> able<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.970> castle<00:02:34.480> sooner<00:02:34.780> once

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
he'll be able to castle sooner once

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.050 
he'll be able to castle sooner once
these<00:02:35.080> pieces<00:02:35.290> get<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.490> let's<00:02:36.670> say<00:02:36.820> white

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
these pieces get up so let's say white

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.150 
these pieces get up so let's say white
plays<00:02:37.540> Knight<00:02:37.570> c3<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.650> again<00:02:38.890> you're<00:02:39.070> not

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
plays Knight c3 and again you're not

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.650 
plays Knight c3 and again you're not
really<00:02:39.460> sure<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.090> know<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:40.270> haven't<00:02:40.480> played

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
really sure you know you haven't played

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.790 
really sure you know you haven't played
this<00:02:40.810> before<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.350> need<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.560> figure<00:02:41.710> out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
this before so you need to figure out

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.860 
this before so you need to figure out
what<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.070> do<00:02:42.220> well<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.120> continue<00:02:43.720> with

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
what to do well you just continue with

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.390 
what to do well you just continue with
the<00:02:43.930> 3<00:02:44.590> principles<00:02:44.770> we've<00:02:45.070> been<00:02:45.160> talking

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
the 3 principles we've been talking

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.480 
the 3 principles we've been talking
about<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:46.110> say<00:02:47.110> defendant<00:02:47.680> or<00:02:47.980> develop<00:02:48.430> your

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
about you say defendant or develop your

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.180 
about you say defendant or develop your
knight<00:02:48.730> or<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:50.110> know<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.470> mean<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.010> could

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
knight or you know I mean you could

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.970 
knight or you know I mean you could
maybe<00:02:51.400> even<00:02:51.550> move<00:02:51.850> your<00:02:51.910> Bishop<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.840> b4<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.470> mean

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
maybe even move your Bishop to b4 I mean

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
maybe even move your Bishop to b4 I mean
there<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.160> all<00:02:54.280> sorts<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.610> moves<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.880> can

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
there are all sorts of moves you can

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.490 
there are all sorts of moves you can
play<00:02:55.210> against<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.630> opening<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.200> want<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
play against this opening but I want to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
play against this opening but I want to
try<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.710> focus<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.520> know<00:02:57.640> moving<00:02:57.970> based<00:02:58.360> on

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
try to focus on you know moving based on

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.450 
try to focus on you know moving based on
these<00:02:58.690> principles<00:02:58.980> rather<00:02:59.980> than<00:03:00.280> memorizing

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
these principles rather than memorizing

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.980 
these principles rather than memorizing
things<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.210> always<00:03:01.390> better<00:03:01.540> when<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.900> have

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
things it's always better when you have

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.570 
things it's always better when you have
reasons<00:03:02.470> why<00:03:02.620> you're<00:03:02.800> making<00:03:02.890> moves<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.520> you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
reasons why you're making moves so you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.400 
reasons why you're making moves so you
need<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.540> if<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.780> follow<00:03:05.020> these<00:03:05.170> three

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
need to so if you follow these three

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.450 
need to so if you follow these three
principles<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:05.980> opening<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.340> will

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
principles in the opening you will

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.670 
principles in the opening you will
rarely<00:03:06.670> be<00:03:06.880> led<00:03:07.120> astray<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.320> do<00:03:08.470> something

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
rarely be led astray so you do something

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190 
rarely be led astray so you do something
like<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.360> let's<00:03:10.360> say<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:10.870> opponent

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
like that and let's say your opponent

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.540 
like that and let's say your opponent
play<00:03:11.710> something<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:13.290> g3<00:03:14.290> now<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.040> idea<00:03:15.460> is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
play something like g3 now the idea is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.840 
play something like g3 now the idea is
that<00:03:15.610> he's<00:03:15.910> going<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> move<00:03:16.480> as<00:03:16.630> bishop<00:03:16.960> here

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that he's going to move as bishop here

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.280 
that he's going to move as bishop here
but<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.180> need<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.570> focus<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:20.080> your<00:03:20.230> own

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
but you just need to focus on your own

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.710 
but you just need to focus on your own
thing<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:20.890> can<00:03:21.190> defend<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> center<00:03:22.390> so

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
thing and you can defend the center so

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.510 
thing and you can defend the center so
you<00:03:22.750> want<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.110> now<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.860> want<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.220> move<00:03:24.310> that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
you want to now you want to move that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.920 
you want to now you want to move that
meets<00:03:24.670> all<00:03:24.790> three<00:03:24.820> principles<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> last

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
meets all three principles so the last

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.660 
meets all three principles so the last
thing<00:03:26.260> towards<00:03:26.590> castling<00:03:27.100> which<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.310> protector

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
thing towards castling which a protector

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.250 
thing towards castling which a protector
king<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:27.970> moving<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.300> bishop<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.170> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
king is moving the bishop so the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.480 
king is moving the bishop so the
question<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.620> where<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:29.860> put<00:03:29.980> your<00:03:30.100> bishop

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
question is where to put your bishop

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.390 
question is where to put your bishop
well<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.630> know<00:03:31.720> e<00:03:31.900> 7<00:03:32.290> might<00:03:32.470> be<00:03:32.650> good<00:03:32.860> but<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
well you know e 7 might be good but it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.040 
well you know e 7 might be good but it
doesn't<00:03:33.730> really<00:03:33.880> do<00:03:34.270> anything<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> center

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
doesn't really do anything in the center

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.770 
doesn't really do anything in the center
and<00:03:35.230> if<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> move<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.640> your<00:03:36.790> Bishop<00:03:37.060> d6<00:03:37.480> it'll

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and if you move to your Bishop d6 it'll

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.870 
and if you move to your Bishop d6 it'll
block<00:03:37.960> this<00:03:38.170> pawns<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.860> really<00:03:39.190> does<00:03:39.730> not

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
block this pawns that really does not

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.280 
block this pawns that really does not
benefit<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.450> center<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.870> think<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.170> two

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
benefit the center so I think the two

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
benefit the center so I think the two
squares<00:03:41.590> are<00:03:42.220> c4<00:03:42.850> or<00:03:43.120> b4<00:03:43.990> or<00:03:44.350> c5<00:03:44.770> or<00:03:44.800> before<00:03:45.400> and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
squares are c4 or b4 or c5 or before and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.120 
squares are c4 or b4 or c5 or before and
I<00:03:46.000> think<00:03:46.140> b4<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.380> best<00:03:47.530> move<00:03:47.740> because

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
I think b4 is the best move because

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.100 
I think b4 is the best move because
although<00:03:48.850> it's<00:03:49.000> not<00:03:49.090> attacking<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.720> central

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
although it's not attacking a central

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.990 
although it's not attacking a central
square<00:03:50.230> directly<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:50.950> threatens<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.700> know<00:03:51.790> in

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
square directly it threatens you know in

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.460 
square directly it threatens you know in
some<00:03:52.209> lines<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.570> could<00:03:52.750> take<00:03:52.990> this<00:03:53.200> Knight

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
some lines you could take this Knight

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.740 
some lines you could take this Knight
and<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:54.010> will<00:03:54.280> weaken<00:03:54.940> white<00:03:55.180> center<00:03:55.540> so

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
and that will weaken white center so

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.240 
and that will weaken white center so
you're<00:03:55.959> you're<00:03:56.230> putting<00:03:56.380> pressure<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.920> white

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
you're you're putting pressure on white

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.470 
you're you're putting pressure on white
center<00:03:57.580> which<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.850> one<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.090> ways<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.240> can

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
center which is one of the ways you can

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.449 
center which is one of the ways you can
control<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.930> center<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.860> you've<00:04:00.010> developed<00:04:00.250> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
control the center so you've developed a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.650 
control the center so you've developed a
piece<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.850> also<00:04:00.940> now<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.240> can<00:04:01.390> build<00:04:01.570> a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
piece and also now you can build a

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.960 
piece and also now you can build a
castle<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.800> I'm<00:04:03.160> not<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.520> go<00:04:03.670> too<00:04:03.730> much

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
castle so I'm not going to go too much

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.610 
castle so I'm not going to go too much
farther<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.660> game<00:04:04.900> but<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.350> want<00:04:05.530> to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
farther in this game but I just want to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.830 
farther in this game but I just want to
stress<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.100> ways<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.640> which<00:04:06.670> people<00:04:06.880> can

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
stress the ways in which people can

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.720 
stress the ways in which people can
apply<00:04:08.110> these<00:04:08.440> three<00:04:08.650> principles<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:09.220> chess<00:04:09.459> to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
apply these three principles of chess to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.130 
apply these three principles of chess to
situations<00:04:10.300> when<00:04:10.480> they<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.810> know<00:04:10.900> they<00:04:11.050> don't

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
situations when they you know they don't

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.320 
situations when they you know they don't
really<00:04:11.380> know<00:04:11.560> what<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:11.800> do<00:04:11.980> similarly<00:04:12.910> say

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
really know what to do similarly say

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.110 
really know what to do similarly say
your<00:04:13.480> opponent<00:04:13.690> play<00:04:14.020> something<00:04:14.380> like<00:04:14.410> this

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
your opponent play something like this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.280 
your opponent play something like this
well<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.150> mean<00:04:16.270> this<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.450> surprising<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.140> is

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
well I mean this is surprising this is

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.470 
well I mean this is surprising this is
the<00:04:17.380> birds<00:04:17.560> opening<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:19.150> know<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.330> has

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
the birds opening and you know it has

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.000 
the birds opening and you know it has
its<00:04:19.510> adherents<00:04:20.109> but<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> want<00:04:20.770> to<00:04:20.830> stress<00:04:20.979> that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
its adherents but I want to stress that

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.430 
its adherents but I want to stress that
you<00:04:21.880> know<00:04:21.970> people<00:04:22.600> don't<00:04:22.690> really<00:04:22.810> prepare<00:04:23.410> for

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
you know people don't really prepare for

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320 
you know people don't really prepare for
this<00:04:23.680> specifically<00:04:24.220> but<00:04:24.610> if<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.090> follow

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
this specifically but if you follow

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.620 
this specifically but if you follow
three<00:04:25.630> principles<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.290> want

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
three principles you want

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.450 
three principles you want
you<00:04:26.750> know<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.140> won't<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.500> problem<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:28.070> mean

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
you know you won't have a problem I mean

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.860 
you know you won't have a problem I mean
you<00:04:28.550> can't<00:04:28.730> play<00:04:28.850> e5<00:04:29.060> because<00:04:29.600> they'll<00:04:29.720> just
