00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.210
 new video in today's video we're going to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.690
 talk about samsung galaxy s 7 as well as 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.340
 you hear it from samsung galaxy s 7 is not 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 no joke or anything I know what it does 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.859
 little has left what would be the samsung 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.840
 galaxy s 6 and s 6 x but then as already 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.240
 you know samsung is a brand worldwide 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.199
 is well known and therefore as much as 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.730
 samsung has been progressing very well and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 Well, we're talking about the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.040
 s 7 the only thing we could be sure of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.410
 of samsung galaxy s 7 or the largest data 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 that is going to be presented during the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 mobile world congress 2016 in barcelona 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 to be held at the end of February 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 next year and we could expect it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 safely for that month and for this 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 year and something that we can be very safe 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.850
 and then the truth is that still too much 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 soon to know or even think about 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 characteristics that this will have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 device however most 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 the rumors of this terminal I think that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.789
 they are specifically aimed at 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.059
 screen as I think it will have 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.339
 a 4k screen a screen that the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.360
 true that will leave very surprised to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.180
 everyone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.370
 all all all your buyers other 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110
 rumor or rather it is not rumor what 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.050
 it is also practically certain is that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 The Samsung Galaxy S 7 come with android 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.640
 the android 6.0 or put android m 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100
 after the presentation of samsung 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 galaxy s 7 during the mobile world 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.690
 congress 2016 in Barcelona and when is it going to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.130
 go to the market or when it would be 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.930
 available to the public 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 probably during the first half 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 of the month of April as it happened with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.580
 the samsung galaxy s 5 and also with the s 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 6 who are your predecessors and the truth 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.729
 that has been a device that has not 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.650
 left nothing to be desired of others 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.240
 devices and then to finish 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.070
 we could talk about the price of this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.940
 device that would probably walk 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.369
 hovering between 800 to 850 euros already 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.869
 that by its screen if it would become 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.940
 4 here we would be talking about a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.860
 extremely screen with a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 resolution that I think so far 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 it would be the best that I could get to see and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.270
 well samsung as always innovating their 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.130
 devices and I hope you have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.799
 liked this information about the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.959
 samsung galaxy s 7 remember still no 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.590
 everything is said but something that yes 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.290
 we could 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.050
 sure that this is going to be presented 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.330
 device in the mobile world congress 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 2017 in Barcelona that is celebrated in 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.959
 February 2016 I hope that I have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 liked this information and see you 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.700
