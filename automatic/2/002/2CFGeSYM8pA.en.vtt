00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.200
 if you understand nothing about what he says 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.610
 This is perfectly normal 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 listen to nothing of what he promises to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.309
 people the people 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 people are sure she will settle 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 the problems in their place how 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 believe these themes that claims to be able to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.090
 to be heard by politicians 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 influential 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.690
 while he does not like to be 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.220
 hear by his own wife at and when 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 I hear him say let's look to 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.970
 the future in his haircut 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 dark indicated he refuses everything is 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.680
 vintage trousers paws she does 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.380
 united but at first glance do not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 commit a detail close 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 blackberry palm attached to his belt 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.060
 dragging on the net I learned 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.700
 things things that would not want 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.159
 especially not me it's a tale payet 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.499
 construction site 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.770
 I first thought to render anonymous in 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:33.609
 all this public info but that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 back changed today 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.979
 I act differently people will keep 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.240
 a positive memory of him of a man 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.130
 who tried to help them 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.119
 on the other hand, people believe what 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.630
 anything they are crazy finally it's 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.170
 me who says that in one of his speeches 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.509
 said as we do it will be 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.179
 insignificant I'm not too sure of 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.079
 context but I will prove it he has 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.660
 wrong a normal person in restaurant 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.110
 first measure the pulse against this kind 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.760
 of action but not me I just made a 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.590
 quick in locating places 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.150
 this distance so sir is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.010
 largely conceivable 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.140
 no one will know what happens before 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.819
 that that laughs sat is this a time of 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.690
 enough leak confesses that he understands 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.690
 I was right 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.390
 and how did it happen
