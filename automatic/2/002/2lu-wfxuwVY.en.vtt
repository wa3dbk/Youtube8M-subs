this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.840> free<00:00:00.989> motion<00:00:01.170> quilting<00:00:01.350> project

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
this is the free motion quilting project

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.640 
this is the free motion quilting project
for<00:00:02.220> crazy<00:00:02.580> weave<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.810> design<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.230> stitched

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
for crazy weave this design is stitched

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.579 
for crazy weave this design is stitched
very<00:00:05.520> simply<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.600> just<00:00:06.839> simply<00:00:07.020> stitch<00:00:07.410> from

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
very simply you just simply stitch from

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.290 
very simply you just simply stitch from
one<00:00:07.859> edge<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.189> your<00:00:08.309> quilting<00:00:08.700> space<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
one edge of your quilting space to the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.470 
one edge of your quilting space to the
other<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> wiggly<00:00:10.500> curvy<00:00:11.070> line<00:00:11.480> then

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
other with a wiggly curvy line then

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.970 
other with a wiggly curvy line then
you're<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.750> travel<00:00:13.049> stitch<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.650> echo

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
you're going to travel stitch and echo

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.210 
you're going to travel stitch and echo
that<00:00:14.160> line<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> couple<00:00:14.700> times<00:00:15.740> really<00:00:16.740> doesn't

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that line a couple times really doesn't

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.400 
that line a couple times really doesn't
matter<00:00:17.369> how<00:00:17.730> many<00:00:17.760> times<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.420> echo<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
matter how many times you echo it this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.000 
matter how many times you echo it this
is<00:00:19.560> entirely<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.560> then<00:00:22.560> you're<00:00:22.769> going

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
is entirely up to you then you're going

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.580 
is entirely up to you then you're going
to<00:00:23.100> create<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> space<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to create a little bit of space and it's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
to create a little bit of space and it's
a<00:00:25.680> gap<00:00:25.949> line<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.760> you're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> travel

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a gap line so you're going to travel

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.800 
a gap line so you're going to travel
stitch<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.640> create<00:00:29.640> these<00:00:29.820> gaps<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.599> some

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
stitch and create these gaps but at some

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.740 
stitch and create these gaps but at some
point<00:00:30.949> interconnect<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.579> line<00:00:33.510> before

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
point interconnect with that line before

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.100 
point interconnect with that line before
it<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.370> simply<00:00:35.760> echo<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> few<00:00:36.960> more

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it then just simply echo a few more

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.160 
it then just simply echo a few more
times<00:00:37.440> give<00:00:38.340> some<00:00:38.610> space<00:00:38.910> between<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.870> line

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
times give some space between that line

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
times give some space between that line
and<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> last<00:00:40.800> gap<00:00:41.129> line<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.030> create

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and the last gap line and then create

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.380 
and the last gap line and then create
another<00:00:42.780> gap<00:00:43.140> line<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> then<00:00:44.579> situation<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
another gap line and then situation I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
another gap line and then situation I
travel<00:00:45.899> stitched<00:00:46.289> first<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.160> branched

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
travel stitched first and then branched

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.049 
travel stitched first and then branched
off<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.120> gap<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.320> reconnected

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
off with my gap and then reconnected

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
off with my gap and then reconnected
you'll<00:00:51.059> notice<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.649> basically<00:00:53.129> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you'll notice that this is basically in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
you'll notice that this is basically in
other<00:00:53.550> designs<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.300> called<00:00:54.539> flowing<00:00:55.170> lines

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
other designs is called flowing lines

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.279 
other designs is called flowing lines
and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> design<00:00:57.210> created<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:57.989> stitching

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and it is a design created by stitching

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.060 
and it is a design created by stitching
these<00:00:59.180> fluid<00:01:00.180> curvy<00:01:00.989> lines<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.649> creating

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
these fluid curvy lines and creating

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
these fluid curvy lines and creating
these<00:01:02.190> gaps<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.270> actually<00:01:03.660> other

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
these gaps and there are actually other

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
these gaps and there are actually other
designs<00:01:04.680> created<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.640> filling<00:01:06.270> those<00:01:06.450> gaps

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
designs created by filling those gaps

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.500 
designs created by filling those gaps
with<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.500> designs<00:01:08.180> Goldilocks<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with other designs Goldilocks is a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.020 
with other designs Goldilocks is a
design<00:01:09.930> that's<00:01:10.170> created<00:01:10.860> by<00:01:11.400> filling<00:01:11.909> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
design that's created by filling in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
design that's created by filling in
those<00:01:12.180> gaps<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.780> stippling<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.070> pebbles<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
those gaps with stippling and pebbles in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
those gaps with stippling and pebbles in
a<00:01:14.700> stream<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.450> created<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.140> filling<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.590> those

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
a stream was created by filling in those

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
a stream was created by filling in those
gaps<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.310> pebbles<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.479> there's<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
gaps with pebbles so there's a lot of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.810 
gaps with pebbles so there's a lot of
things<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
things that you can do with just the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
things that you can do with just the
space<00:01:21.030> line<00:01:21.299> design<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.560> doing

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
space line design but what we're doing

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
space line design but what we're doing
this<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:24.180> stitching<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> basic

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
this time is we're stitching the basic

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
this time is we're stitching the basic
form<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.100> simple<00:01:26.640> flowing

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
form of it just these simple flowing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.569 
form of it just these simple flowing
lines<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.710> we're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> layer

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
lines and then we're going to layer

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.410 
lines and then we're going to layer
another<00:01:30.570> set<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.170> flowing<00:01:31.740> lines<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.220> top<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
another set of flowing lines on top to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
another set of flowing lines on top to
create<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> crazy<00:01:34.290> weave<00:01:34.850> it's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> very

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
create the crazy weave it's a very

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
create the crazy weave it's a very
organic<00:01:36.780> design<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> pretty<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
organic design you can pretty much do

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
organic design you can pretty much do
anything<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.119> want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.170> allow

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
anything you want to with this and allow

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.679 
anything you want to with this and allow
it<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.070> freeform<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> nice

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it to be very freeform and the nice

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
it to be very freeform and the nice
thing<00:01:42.720> about<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.320> even<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.130> mess<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.399> even

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
thing about is even if you mess up even

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
thing about is even if you mess up even
if<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:45.840> perfect<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.530> still

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
if things don't look perfect it's still

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.359 
if things don't look perfect it's still
going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.500> fast-forward<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
going to look good so we fast-forward on

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to look good so we fast-forward on
with<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.790> design<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:52.020> here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
with this design and I'm right here

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
with this design and I'm right here
towards<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> end<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> first<00:01:53.820> part<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
towards the end of the first part of it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
towards the end of the first part of it
and<00:01:54.600> again<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.950> wanted<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> could

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and again if you wanted to you could

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.580 
and again if you wanted to you could
stop<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> call<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> flowing

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
stop right here and call it flowing

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.880 
stop right here and call it flowing
lines<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.040> you'd<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.310> done<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.500> really

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
lines and you'd be done but we we really

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
lines and you'd be done but we we really
want<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.340> crazy<00:02:02.820> weave<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> how<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
want to see crazy weave and how this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.649 
want to see crazy weave and how this
design<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.560> different<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:06.420> kind<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
design is different and what kind of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
design is different and what kind of
texture<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> create<00:02:07.530> because

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
texture it's going to create because

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.619 
texture it's going to create because
it's<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.220> create<00:02:08.399> quite<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> different

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it's going to create quite a different

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.280 
it's going to create quite a different
texture<00:02:10.020> from<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.810> horizontal<00:02:12.810> or

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
texture from just this horizontal or

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.190 
texture from just this horizontal or
vertical<00:02:13.620> flowy<00:02:14.069> line<00:02:14.430> texture<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
vertical flowy line texture so now I

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.319 
vertical flowy line texture so now I
just<00:02:16.319> simply<00:02:16.620> rotate<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.459> entire<00:02:17.489> quilting

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
just simply rotate the entire quilting

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.990 
just simply rotate the entire quilting
piece<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.959> start<00:02:19.370> stitching<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.730> same

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
piece and start stitching the same

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.539 
piece and start stitching the same
design<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> opposite<00:02:22.799> direction<00:02:22.950> so

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
design but in the opposite direction so

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.479 
design but in the opposite direction so
I<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:24.170> horizontal<00:02:25.170> flowing<00:02:25.859> lines<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.400> now

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
I have horizontal flowing lines and now

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.369 
I have horizontal flowing lines and now
I'm<00:02:26.609> stitching<00:02:26.849> over<00:02:27.329> that<00:02:27.510> with<00:02:27.780> vertical

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
I'm stitching over that with vertical

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.399 
I'm stitching over that with vertical
flowing<00:02:28.859> lines<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.049> little

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
flowing lines and it is a little

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.979 
flowing lines and it is a little
confusing<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:32.159> try<00:02:32.579> and<00:02:32.730> remember<00:02:32.939> which<00:02:33.420> set

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
confusing to try and remember which set

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.470 
confusing to try and remember which set
of<00:02:34.019> lines<00:02:34.439> you're<00:02:34.739> working<00:02:35.159> on<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.239> try

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
of lines you're working on so just try

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
of lines you're working on so just try
and<00:02:36.540> keep<00:02:36.810> your<00:02:37.049> piece<00:02:37.319> moving<00:02:38.040> straight<00:02:38.430> up

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and keep your piece moving straight up

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.940 
and keep your piece moving straight up
and<00:02:38.909> down<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.840> helps<00:02:40.349> because<00:02:40.470> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and down that really helps because it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.009 
and down that really helps because it
helps<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.639> be<00:02:41.760> able<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.060> see<00:02:42.389> which<00:02:42.780> direction

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
helps you be able to see which direction

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.539 
helps you be able to see which direction
you're<00:02:43.409> going<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.859> you're<00:02:44.069> just<00:02:44.250> going

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
you're going you know you're just going

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.280 
you're going you know you're just going
forward<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.120> back<00:02:45.329> rather<00:02:45.659> than<00:02:45.870> side<00:02:46.139> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
forward and back rather than side to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.500 
forward and back rather than side to
side<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.489> see<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.879> stitched<00:02:48.329> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
side so you can see I just stitched a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
side so you can see I just stitched a
gap<00:02:48.750> line<00:02:49.049> right<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.500> travel<00:02:50.250> stitching

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
gap line right there travel stitching

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.050 
gap line right there travel stitching
and<00:02:51.049> echoing<00:02:52.049> that<00:02:52.200> line<00:02:52.439> and<00:02:52.819> already<00:02:53.819> you

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and echoing that line and already you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.179 
and echoing that line and already you
can<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.540> funky<00:02:54.900> texture<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.650> being

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
can see the funky texture that is being

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.080 
can see the funky texture that is being
created<00:02:56.549> by<00:02:57.409> overlapping<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:59.090> interlocking

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
created by overlapping and interlocking

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.129 
created by overlapping and interlocking
these<00:03:00.659> flowing<00:03:01.530> lines<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:02.790> creates<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.599> woven

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
these flowing lines it creates a woven

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.819 
these flowing lines it creates a woven
texture<00:03:04.739> almost<00:03:05.099> like<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.879> very<00:03:06.780> loose<00:03:07.169> weave

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
texture almost like a very loose weave

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.690 
texture almost like a very loose weave
if<00:03:08.609> you<00:03:08.760> ever<00:03:08.790> had<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.409> hand<00:03:10.409> woven<00:03:10.650> scarf<00:03:11.099> or

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
if you ever had a hand woven scarf or

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.899 
if you ever had a hand woven scarf or
shawl<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.829> how<00:03:13.829> things<00:03:14.250> kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.639> start

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
shawl and how things kind of start

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.369 
shawl and how things kind of start
wearing<00:03:15.239> especially<00:03:15.450> if<00:03:15.689> it<00:03:15.750> was<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> woven

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
wearing especially if it was a woven

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.259 
wearing especially if it was a woven
with<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> very<00:03:16.889> loose<00:03:17.159> weave<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.699> is<00:03:17.849> kind<00:03:18.150> of

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
with a very loose weave this is kind of

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.839 
with a very loose weave this is kind of
the<00:03:18.329> effect<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.199> it's<00:03:19.829> crazy<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.699> little

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
the effect and it's crazy and a little

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.750 
the effect and it's crazy and a little
organic<00:03:21.419> but<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.959> same<00:03:22.199> time<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.549> very

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
organic but at the same time it's a very

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.240 
organic but at the same time it's a very
formal<00:03:24.299> design<00:03:24.479> it's<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.870> grid<00:03:25.250> essentially

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
formal design it's a grid essentially

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.849 
formal design it's a grid essentially
it's<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.669> grid<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.810> free-form<00:03:28.500> grid

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
it's a grid but it's a free-form grid

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.580 
it's a grid but it's a free-form grid
and<00:03:29.190> other<00:03:30.060> freeform<00:03:30.629> grids<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.319> our

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and other freeform grids we have our

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.449 
and other freeform grids we have our
matrix<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.639> matrix<00:03:33.120> raised<00:03:33.659> so<00:03:34.650> definitely

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
matrix and matrix raised so definitely

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.610 
matrix and matrix raised so definitely
check<00:03:35.729> out<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.329> of<00:03:36.389> these<00:03:36.840> different<00:03:37.019> designs

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
check out all of these different designs

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.619 
check out all of these different designs
and<00:03:38.010> see<00:03:38.159> what<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.459> can<00:03:38.639> do<00:03:38.790> with<00:03:38.940> them<00:03:39.090> this

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
and see what you can do with them this

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.659 
and see what you can do with them this
is<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.989> one<00:03:40.260> variation<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:41.129> just<00:03:41.519> taking

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
is just one variation of just taking

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.780 
is just one variation of just taking
simply<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.510> same<00:03:42.750> design<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.699> stacking<00:03:44.699> it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
simply the same design and stacking it

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.939 
simply the same design and stacking it
on<00:03:44.879> top<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.299> itself<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.900> see<00:03:46.079> what<00:03:46.260> happens<00:03:46.650> and

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
on top of itself to see what happens and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.589 
on top of itself to see what happens and
here's<00:03:47.519> what<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.760> looks<00:03:47.940> like<00:03:48.060> whenever<00:03:48.329> you

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
here's what it looks like whenever you

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.760 
here's what it looks like whenever you
finish<00:03:48.810> crazy<00:03:49.709> weave
