00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
carbohydrates all three of those protein

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880 
carbohydrates all three of those protein
fat<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.329> carbohydrates<00:01:00.020> are<00:01:00.170> necessary<00:01:00.649> for

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
fat and carbohydrates are necessary for

healthy fat loss so how do you maximize
your<00:01:07.790> fat<00:01:07.940> loss<00:01:08.120> how<00:01:08.330> do<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.479> be<00:01:08.570> most

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
your fat loss how do you be most

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.560 
your fat loss how do you be most
efficient<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:10.250> see<00:01:10.460> your<00:01:10.610> abs<00:01:10.790> or<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.120> see<00:01:11.360> is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
efficient to see your abs or to see is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.510 
efficient to see your abs or to see is
to<00:01:11.870> see<00:01:11.900> your<00:01:12.080> definition<00:01:12.680> or<00:01:12.770> lace<00:01:12.950> your<00:01:13.280> also

females<00:01:14.050> not<00:01:15.050> grow<00:01:15.229> some<00:01:15.440> females<00:01:15.710> girls<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
females not grow some females girls and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.920 
females not grow some females girls and
guys<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:18.380> heat<00:01:18.620> again<00:01:18.979> is<00:01:19.130> high<00:01:19.280> protein<00:01:19.490> and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
guys the heat again is high protein and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.990 
guys the heat again is high protein and
why<00:01:20.930> do<00:01:21.440> we<00:01:21.560> need<00:01:21.680> high<00:01:21.799> protein<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.790> answer

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
why do we need high protein the answer

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.630 
why do we need high protein the answer
to<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.450> protein<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.260> a<00:01:24.440> very<00:01:25.100> very<00:01:25.310> high

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
to that is protein is a very very high

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.630 
to that is protein is a very very high
thermic<00:01:26.240> nutrient<00:01:27.130> just<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:28.250> thermos

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
thermic nutrient just like thermos

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.010 
thermic nutrient just like thermos
thermic<00:01:29.330> what<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:30.380> word<00:01:30.530> means<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:32.020> if

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
thermic what that word means is that if

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.109 
thermic what that word means is that if
you<00:01:33.229> consume<00:01:33.590> protein<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:34.940> need<00:01:35.090> a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
you consume protein so if we need a

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.969 
you consume protein so if we need a
chicken<00:01:35.390> breast<00:01:35.630> let's<00:01:35.900> say<00:01:36.080> your<00:01:36.590> body<00:01:36.770> is

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
chicken breast let's say your body is

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.100 
chicken breast let's say your body is
gonna<00:01:37.130> burn<00:01:37.430> more<00:01:37.700> calories<00:01:38.080> digesting<00:01:39.080> that

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
gonna burn more calories digesting that

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.740 
gonna burn more calories digesting that
chicken<00:01:39.500> breast<00:01:39.710> in<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.950> wood<00:01:40.130> for<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:41.030> harbor

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
chicken breast in a wood for a harbor

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.530 
chicken breast in a wood for a harbor
fat<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.380> like<00:01:42.740> pasta<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.340> bread<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.970> peanut

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
fat so like pasta and bread and peanut

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.600 
fat so like pasta and bread and peanut
butter<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.049> all<00:01:45.170> those<00:01:45.350> foods<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:45.890> our<00:01:46.369> body

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
butter and all those foods so our body

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.830 
butter and all those foods so our body
is<00:01:46.760> just<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.119> burn<00:01:47.390> more<00:01:47.600> calories

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
is just you know burn more calories
