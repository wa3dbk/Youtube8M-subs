00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.740
 yo guests and very good day everyone 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.330
 down and today a new engine 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.969
 for 3 game play 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.619
 And well today with the FHD it's none 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.630
 beautiful with every can it was one 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.400
 attempt for moment every I can barf 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.750
 so the fall try i played team that 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.359
 match apporter de 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.859
 but i fall but yes actually you would 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.419
 can't say i'll be my top 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.119
 with teammates error moment 10 most 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.470
 coincidentally so hard in this game 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.329
 what I play 40 at 540 at 5008 kd 40 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.350
 I make kills on my own and my own 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.110
 teammates 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.830
 make 35 kills with cement and with his 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.600
 five and I am only going to die 15 in total 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.530
 so that means my team edge with 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.780
 they all 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.560
 many more have died because of me 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.900
 we want this game 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
 but with 3 guys difference 3 kills 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.800
 difference in food makes that difference because 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.360
 my stupid the end up 70 70 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.000
 I did not yet make the same or species 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.530
 very handy lager in a short time 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.150
 it's just because my teammates are in 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.409
 this jar really just awful 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.380
 heart failure 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.899
 if you consider that we are with 75 to 72 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.759
 have won and I am only 5 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.039
 kilogram means that the team weyts 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.490
 Have died 67 times 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.810
 67 and 67 pounds are gone and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 put marvel at kills 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.549
 can you see how yes and how bad with team 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.649
 hot heavy when I am forty to five stuff 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.969
 but for a while it doesn't go under 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.609
 is it actually why I have 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.079
 chose this game play but yes I want 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.020
 talk to you about 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.700
 Yes strange things were weird things 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.829
 things strange things just what what 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.679
 things what things just again what things 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.939
 toxic livestream no god good and there 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.560
 no good went well 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.240
 there were no stream problems except 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.649
 the youtuber bit dirty another youtube 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.290
 on the toe of the lake that ran the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.720
 friends 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.210
 youtube has the requirements so 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.680
 a lot of time because there is nothing wrong with the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.150
 stream but with an ice cream on toes 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.460
 from the way we get that light from one 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.650
 youtube and that was in between last night 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 unloaded the Streamy seems a bit 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.430
 was not to the host incidentally until lag 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.570
 so just complete with youtube but that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.340
 was a pity 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.229
 we have streamed twenty five 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.350
 may had it as much less than 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.420
 also need the raid five or six more 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.010
 options I do n't know exactly but it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.780
 was much less than we had hoped 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.240
 actually because all much higher estimated 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.820
 in any case and yes not everyone like 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.670
 In the evening it didn't really play at all 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.300
 completely tasty and yes it just went 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.740
 not 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.090
 we will certainly do this again soon 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.680
 I think I will try with about 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.120
 Now the same party of a few 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.459
 probably the same but anyway 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.750
 branco erik and I will go anyway with 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.120
 the three of them may still be on people 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.230
 and so don't go the bowl is just full of it 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 may I join because we already have there 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.260
 have a regular team for that arranged 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.880
 so we all arranged that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.470
 maybe do it more often and then we go 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.030
 just try to make our own upper 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.200
 then break our own number of mode 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.730
 it must certainly succeed with 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 who have 5 or 6 in that way 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.420
 achieved must certainly succeed 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.540
 so yes then we will go one 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.860
 break sometime but just I was just 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.320
 before I want to leave this immediately 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.000
 I was suddenly called to my house 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.720
 I just think about it completely 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.040
 polite 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.350
 it starts suddenly some woman 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.209
 that suddenly starts completely well you would 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.030
 can say crosses but she started best 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.320
 well yes to get them then but then I say 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.110
 just screaming at me she started screaming 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.330
 oh yes and no quarrels with my dog 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.209
 have to listen 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.110
 o no o no so I always like that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.700
 what the fuck why are you calling me okay 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.340
 just call randomly or you are wrong 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.750
 is mine I couldn't speak a word 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.519
 so get the woman who was so busy 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.900
 talking or something I just could not 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.170
 intervene I could not intervene 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.239
 I could not say anything they did not understand 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.310
 yes it was really strange they sisters 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.720
 said yes so with started so i will 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.280
 emit palette 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.750
 she let the dog hear that dog was going 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.970
 yank or something no i don't know what is there 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.210
 everything was but where the fuck in it 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.860
 me now 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.110
 she just used wrong because 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.130
 so I could not intervene so 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 me as a season 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.200
 place I stop because yes I will not go there 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.550
 listen to it for three minutes or so every 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.540
 then disappoint if they had 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.220
 won 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.600
 strong disappoints after 20 seconds or so 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.250
 so I did that too 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.810
 that's why she called tomorrow time I had 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.550
 something like that what the fuck you just got 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.920

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.560
 I have started with it I knew I really 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.180
 not a bit more expensive in my pocket 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.410

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.200

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.720
