00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
different pieces of hardware like if you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.280 
different pieces of hardware like if you
had<00:02:06.090> an<00:02:06.299> app<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> were<00:02:06.810> running<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.200> your

had an app that you were running on your

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
Xbox one it would be nice if that was

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.050 
Xbox one it would be nice if that was
done<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.599> done<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.340> depends<00:02:14.970> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
done and done right it really depends on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.350 
done and done right it really depends on
how<00:02:15.330> smart<00:02:16.260> Microsoft<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.640> Windows<00:02:18.060> 10

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
how smart Microsoft is with Windows 10

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.050 
how smart Microsoft is with Windows 10
and<00:02:18.629> how<00:02:19.140> well<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.770> works<00:02:20.040> across<00:02:20.430> all<00:02:20.790> their

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and how well it works across all their

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.309 
and how well it works across all their
different<00:02:21.480> platforms<00:02:21.989> because<00:02:22.140> that's

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
different platforms because that's

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.020 
different platforms because that's
something<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.709> even<00:02:22.830> Apple<00:02:23.340> hasn't<00:02:23.700> really

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
something that even Apple hasn't really

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.990 
something that even Apple hasn't really
done<00:02:24.660> successfully<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.770> far<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:26.670> haven't

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
done successfully so far they haven't

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.390 
done successfully so far they haven't
really<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.690> use<00:02:28.170> an<00:02:28.290> iPad<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.920> an

really you know you use an iPad or an

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.339 
really you know you use an iPad or an
iPhone<00:02:29.489> they<00:02:30.209> it's<00:02:30.420> totally<00:02:30.900> separate<00:02:31.319> from

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
should say they haven't found a way to

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
should say they haven't found a way to
really<00:02:36.180> integrate<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:36.989> make<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.650> whole

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
really integrate it and make the whole

Mac OS op you know ecosystem like work
across<00:02:41.849> all<00:02:42.180> platforms<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.260> find<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
across all platforms so if they find a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.949 
across all platforms so if they find a
way<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.330> logical<00:02:45.900> fashion

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
way to do this in a in a logical fashion

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.259 
way to do this in a in a logical fashion
Microsoft<00:02:46.860> where<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.670> something<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
Microsoft where it's something that

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509 
Microsoft where it's something that
people<00:02:48.569> want<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.470> everything<00:02:50.430> they

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
people want to use on everything they

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.030 
people want to use on everything they
own<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.030> has<00:02:51.239> Microsoft<00:02:51.870> software<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.620> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
own that has Microsoft software on it it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.860 
own that has Microsoft software on it it
could<00:02:53.280> work<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.640> really<00:02:53.970> well<00:02:54.239> we'll<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
could work out really well we'll have to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.270 
could work out really well we'll have to
wait<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.110> see<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.530> screw<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
wait and see if they screw it up and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.770 
wait and see if they screw it up and
just<00:02:56.370> make<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> gimmick<00:02:57.330> like<00:02:57.629> on

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
just make it more of a gimmick like on

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
just make it more of a gimmick like on
the<00:02:57.900> Xbox<00:02:58.379> one<00:02:58.680> where<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.550> just<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.909> know

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the Xbox one where it's just so you know

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.580 
the Xbox one where it's just so you know
you<00:03:00.150> could<00:03:00.330> run<00:03:00.480> like<00:03:00.659> two<00:03:00.959> apps<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.470> are

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
you could run like two apps that are

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.800 
you could run like two apps that are
like<00:03:01.830> run<00:03:02.159> half-assed<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> no<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:03.690> really

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
like run half-assed and no one really

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.140 
like run half-assed and no one really
cares<00:03:03.959> about<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:05.129> this<00:03:05.519> whole<00:03:05.670> Windows

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
cares about it then this whole Windows

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850 
cares about it then this whole Windows
10<00:03:06.360> integration<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.080> going<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.440> waste<00:03:07.709> of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
10 integration is going to be a waste of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.940 
10 integration is going to be a waste of
their<00:03:08.010> time<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:09.239> like<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.540> said<00:03:09.959> smart<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.650> paper

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
their time it like I said smart on paper

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.339 
their time it like I said smart on paper
but<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.519> depends<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:12.810> actually

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
but it depends on how they actually

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.250 
but it depends on how they actually
implement<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.040> bring<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.209> life<00:03:15.420> now<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
implement it and bring it to life now it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.250 
implement it and bring it to life now it
could<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:17.150> I'm<00:03:18.150> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.569> being<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.900> devil's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
could be I'm kind of being a devil's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.750 
could be I'm kind of being a devil's
advocate<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.830> I'm<00:03:19.890> gonna<00:03:19.980> disagree<00:03:20.459> with

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
advocate and I'm gonna disagree with

advocate and I'm gonna disagree with
myself<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.480> second<00:03:21.870> if<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.110> makes<00:03:22.319> any

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
myself in a second if that makes any

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.610 
myself in a second if that makes any
sense<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:23.700> could<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.450> an<00:03:24.629> enticing<00:03:25.049> thing

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
sense it could be an enticing thing

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.890 
sense it could be an enticing thing
