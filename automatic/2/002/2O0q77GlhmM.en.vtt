00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 in this video we will look at the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.299
 samsung chromebook two designed to 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.620
 to be simple he is really beautiful 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.990
 designed 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.030
 runs on the google operating system 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.630
 osn is ideal for the daily 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 pursuits 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 all you have to do is to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 log with your google account he is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.340
 available in two different sizes 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.789
 namely a smaller version the 11.6 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.650
 inch and there is also a larger version 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.670
 13.3 inches and both of them are just bad 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.080
 compact 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.400
 to give a bit of an idea how 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 big the screens i would have one now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.030
 cardboard with an A4 format 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 so he sees that the 13.3 in them actually 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 is just as big as the yes it is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 cardboard itself and yes these versions 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 of course slightly smaller 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.350
 well because they are so compact you can do them 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.320
 real fine for example transporting in you 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 bag everywhere you go 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 that is actually a bit the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 intention of these chromebooks that you 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 so real about very soon a can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 for example to check your mail 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.180
 check your social networks 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.290
 he is also not heavy at all 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 for example this 13.3 inch which weighs eh 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 You can easily put 1.4 kilograms in one 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.390
 raise their hand and yes they have 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.740
 a difference in resolution the 11.6 inch 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.610
 for example, has a resolution of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.409
 1366 by 768 and the 13.3 inch full hd though 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 book really say that of all 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.880
 I have chromebooks in my hands 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.650
 had this samsung chromebook two 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 on the nicest screens 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.270
 colors, for example, come true 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.159
 very nice about it and it is natural 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
 very nice when for example to the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.329
 are looking at photos 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 then the top of the design 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 this two chromebook has a leather 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.329
 like look also feels like that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 of course not real leather 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.500
 but we see this example we 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.700
 back with earlier smartphones from 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 samsung 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.790
 it has a very nice grip in that is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.600
 naturally nice when you have it in your hand 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 likes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.939
 he is not very fat at 1.65 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.490
 centimeters thick and fits that really well in 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.780
 your bag and the screen is myself 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 just very flexible you can be one 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.860
 make it easy to move back and forth 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.020
 simply very firmly attached 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.420
 at the top it is provided with a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.730
 hd camera quite handy of course as 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.290
 you 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.209
 make google hangouts to 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.459
 video calls to make it 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.530
 keyboard is not lit. 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.849
 I thought the trackpad was a plus 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.280
 those feet whole 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.310
 Jasmund can you very accurately with it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.040
 it also works surfaces next to it 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.080
 simply very ergonomically designed throughout 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
 nice to work with you can while 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.140
 just leave your hands on it 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.790
 rest 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.769
 and it is also a very sturdy surface 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.420
 for example if you press it then see 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.549
 you think that's just a very solid one 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.040
 material and that is really one 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.090
 big plus of this two chromebook 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.280
 from samsung 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.010
 that for the price so paid for 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.319
 that he just designed very nicely and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 also so is made of a solid 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.129
 material 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.440
 well then about the connections he has 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.730
 the two usb connections on both 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.230
 one side 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.879
 He also blogs about an HDMI 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.340
 connection sugar and therefore easy 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.049
 connect to your TV 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 he also has a micro sd card slots 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.329
 to your memory what extend so 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160
 and it also has a 3 point 5 mm jacket 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.560
 sit on one side 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.690
 thanks to its ssd disk and the fact that 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.299
 he with minimal specifications 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.310
 can perform well because most of it 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.139
 a chromebook goes online and it starts 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.720
 also quickly when I for example order too 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.430
 close it then you will also see the screen 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.739
 also resumes immediately so you can too 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.470
 get started right away 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.310
 that is of course a characteristic of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 a chromebook 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.489
 which is also a characteristic of one 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.250
 Chromebook is the one that features 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.109
 few storage capacity and that is 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.239
 of course so because you like most 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.609
 goes through the cloud 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.470
 and in this case that is google drive 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.419
 and like I said , this chrome is too 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.880
 really ideal for basic use you log 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.650
 into your google account and that's how you can 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.180
 for example, all your daily activities 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 do such as your social 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.440
 networks check your mail you can surf 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.810
 watch a video on the internet at 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.639
 netflix or on youtube and you can 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.819
 of course also a simple one 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.290
 gamer games like angry birds 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.160
 heavier games that are more graphic 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.040
 ask 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.049
 yes that cart unfortunately not pay 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.260
 it is also not meant to be a laptop pen 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.330
 edit photos or videos as well 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.770
 It is true that your programs are like Excel 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.110
 the can not use it is not 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.930
 a laptop suitable for the office 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.030
 work but luckily it does 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.900
 about programs that, for example 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.740
 was replaced as googledocs 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.330
 well then we go to the screen 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.039
 yourself to show how to ram 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.710
 looks to the bottom left you have 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.000
 for example the chrome browser 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.409
 well then you can very easily quickly 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.090
 to your e-mail 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.129
 you can keep track of your social networks 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.050
 such as twitter or facebook 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.430
 and here you have, for example, youtube 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.259
 for example, you also want one 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.020
 watch movie on netflix it can 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.400

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.159
 all applications 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.150
 but do you want to buy an application then do 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.039
 you do that in the chrome 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.900
 shop then you see them all there too 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.150
 to appear 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.560
 well here you can see them all 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.569
 can purchase 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.229
 well i already have some applications 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.360
 by standing up when purchased there are 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.759
 also a number of standard applications 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.319
 just like on it, for example 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.319
 Google Hangouts gets the same right 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:26.289
 and googledocs you can also see your google here 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.779
