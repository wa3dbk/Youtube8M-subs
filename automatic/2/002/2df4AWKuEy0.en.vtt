00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the book unfolds six principles 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.069
 strategic ones that are described to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.200
 then one wins all without fighting 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.840
 sancho said your goal should be to take 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 intact everything under the sky of 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 this way your troops will not be exhausted nor your 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 victory will be total 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.210
 this is the art of strategy 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.100
 offensive because you get 100 victories in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.350
 100 battles is not the height of the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.260
 ability to subdue the enemy without 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 combat is the height of skill 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 replaces the flags and banners of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 your enemy for your people mixes 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.960
 war chariots with own and mounts 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.480
 he treats captives well and attends 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 this is called winning a battle and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.309
 become the strongest target 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 of a company is usually capture 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 a dominant portion of your market in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.399
 the context of business take 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 intact everything under the sky 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 so that victory is total means 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 that his battles for dominance of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.190
 market should not destroy profitability 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 of the industry is to capture the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 market without destroying it is possible to win 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 without fighting in many ways the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 research of the industries 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 competitive have shown 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.090
 subtle indirect actions less 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.189
 notorious are less likely to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
 elicit responses from the competition 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.299
 any successful action that delays or 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.250
 do not provoke a response from the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 competition will result in a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.619
 gain of market share 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.570
 by the attacker 2 avoid the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.509
 strength and attack the weakness xa nsu 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 he said then an army can be compared 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.229
 with a stream because it 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.090
 as the flowing flow avoids the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.580
 heights and run hurriedly towards 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 lowlands so an army avoids the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.200
 strength and attack the objectives more 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.390
 weak if you can march a thousand and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.240
 fatigarse is because you travel where no 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.340
 there is enemy enter the nothing rushes 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 against the emptiness surrounds what defends 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 Assault what does not wait for you near the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.539
 battlefield await the enemy that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.600
 comes from far in front of an army 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.490
 rested an exhausted enemy in front of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.189
 troops well fed other 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.259
 hungry in this way only 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.869
 It needs little strength to achieve much 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.940
 the invincibility lies in the defense 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.940
 the possibility of victory in the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.070
 attack 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.350
 in a business context it is much more 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.470
 productive attack the weak points of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.030
 your competitor that attack your strengths 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.760
 attack the weaknesses take advantage of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.580
 limited resources of your company attack 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 the fortress is wasting the attacking 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.300
 Weakness shortens the path that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 leads to victory attacking the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.310
 strength lengthens it to attack weakness 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.830
 increase the value of your victory attack 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.750
 the strength is squandered by his company 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.790
 You can also go into nothing 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.580
 commit against the vacuum and surround what 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.230
 defend by creating new products 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.660
 attacking niche markets entering 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 in new geographic markets for 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.710
 implementing these ideas is fundamental 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 determine the weak and strong points 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.740
 of the competition as well as the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.100
 own three deception and knowledge 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.200
 previous sancho said the reason why 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.360
 the preclear prince and the wise general 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.130
 conquer the enemy whenever they act 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.230
 and his deeds surpass those of the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.750
 ordinary men is the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.790
 prior knowledge the one that ignores the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.569
 plans of neighboring states can not 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.310
 Agree your alliances timely yes 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.010
 to the conditions of the mountains 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.810
 forest dangerous gorges 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.569
 swamps and bogs can not head 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.430
 the march of an army if it does not use 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.469
 natural local guides not 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.870
 You can acquire the advantages of the land 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.670
 until a general ignores is only one 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.980
 of the three issues to be considered 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.650
 unfit to command the armies of a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.900
 hegemonic king all wars are 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.639
 based on deception the enemy must 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.739
 ignore where I propose to rid the 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.139
 battle because if you ignore it you should be 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.419
 prepared in many places and when 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.159
 prepare in many places I will just have to 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.709
 fight a few men in 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.689
 any of them in a context of 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.760
 business the prior knowledge is the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.590
 information and deep understanding of what 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.469
 which is related to its competitors 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.290
 your strengths your weaknesses your 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.239
 plans your people try to penetrate 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.340
 markets with little information is a 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.959
 mistake you have to gather the maximum 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.299
 information about the market and 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.340
 main players is also 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.769
 necessary to find out the names of the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.630
 executives who run the competition in 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.639
 what university graduated what 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.410
 experiences have formed them where 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.390
 they get their information how 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.520
 consider the industry the degree of 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.560
 risk that are willing to run the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.360
 importance that the different goals of 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.150
 business clothes for them and that 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.130
 ambitions have it is important to know 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.600
 If within the company there is disagreement 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.170
 about the strategy that they can 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.200
 explode 4 speed and preparation 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.750
 Sancho said speed is the essence 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.000
 same of the war takes advantage of the lack 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.040
 of preparation of the enemy travels by 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.320
 unexpected routes and attacks where not 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.060
 be forewarned in a context of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.610
 business the speed is useful for 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.470
 keep the initiative that can 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.900
 keep the initiative will get the 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.760
 success in the competition own 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.220
 nature of the competition is the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.470
 constant change to survive and 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.630
 thrive in the dynamic and chaotic world 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.030
 It is necessary for a company to act with 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.100
 maximum speed the speed is 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.750
 essential to put out of balance 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.360
 to competition and preserve the 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.070
 initiative the speed attached to deception 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.360
 generates an initial surprise in the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.630
 competition that is difficult 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.490
 recover a succession of initiatives 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.410
 surprising and unexpected leads to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.860
 paralysis and loss of morale by 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.550
 part 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.819
 Competition 5 influences your opponent 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.800
 sancho said therefore those who are 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.629
 skilled in the art of war attract the 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.090
 enemy to the battlefield and it does not 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.430
 let's take there for him do not pressure the 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.379
 enemy until cornered when the 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.930
 wild beasts are cornered 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.659
 they struggle with despair the more 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.520
 true is this about men if they know 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.009
 that have no option will be beaten until the 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.990
 death in a business context is 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.080
 important to be in the position of power 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.430
 set the rules of competition 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.229
 take the competitor to the field that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.779
 we have chosen and do not leave 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.849
 take the one he prefers is accurate 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:14.490
 face competition over time 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.740
 and place that we have chosen the 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.020
 goal is fundamentally to face 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.849
 the mind the thought processes and 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.370
 will of the management team of the 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.289
 competition a basic factor for 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.200
 develop this strategy are the 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:32.290
 alliances follow the following rules 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.110
 know how to keep an alliance know 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.020
 how and when to end an alliance avoid 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.420
 Attack powerful alliances avoid allies 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.150
 that generate distrust use with 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.790
 ability to your own allies prevent 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.360
 that your competitors join in case of 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.310
 attack 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.720
 first I separated his competitor from his 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.610
 allies 6 strong leadership and for this the 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.890
 general who does not seek personal glory 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.050
 when he advances or worries about avoiding 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.760
 the punishment when it recedes but its 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.680
 only purpose is to protect the 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.380
 population and promote the best causes 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.980
 of his summer is the precious jewel of 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.590
 state 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.690
 few are of this temper in the 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.790
 business context is important the 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.160
 leadership focused on the objectives of 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.160
 business and in the welfare of the people not 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.900
 in the personal needs of the leader 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.430
 these leaders are exceptional and 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.440
 difficult to find for your 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.300
 willingness to put the needs 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.730
 of others to own and own a 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.770
 strong and temperate character are the 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.770
 true gem of an organization
