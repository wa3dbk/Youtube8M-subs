00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
benefit here is that at this point we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.880 
benefit here is that at this point we
have<00:00:48.620> worked<00:00:49.010> our<00:00:49.190> back<00:00:49.510> from<00:00:50.590> almost<00:00:51.590> every

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
have worked our back from almost every

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.260 
have worked our back from almost every
angle<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:54.550> everything<00:00:55.550> by<00:00:55.670> this<00:00:55.850> point<00:00:56.000> should

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
angle so everything by this point should

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.759 
angle so everything by this point should
be<00:00:56.329> pretty<00:00:56.630> much<00:00:56.750> pre<00:00:57.380> exhausted

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
be pretty much pre exhausted

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.410 
be pretty much pre exhausted
something<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:00.890> pretty<00:01:01.129> exhausting<00:01:01.609> you

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
something is pretty exhausting you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.320 
something is pretty exhausting you
technically<00:01:02.930> don't<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.699> be<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:07.210> be<00:01:08.210> the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
technically don't have to be the be the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.120 
technically don't have to be the be the
biggest<00:01:08.690> sticker<00:01:08.960> on<00:01:09.259> film<00:01:09.590> at<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.860> point

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
biggest sticker on film at that point

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.370 
biggest sticker on film at that point
because<00:01:10.670> technically<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.990> muscles<00:01:12.320> are

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
because technically the muscles are

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.620 
because technically the muscles are
already<00:01:12.710> pumped<00:01:13.009> now<00:01:13.250> already<00:01:13.640> alive<00:01:14.030> they're

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
already pumped now already alive they're

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.440 
already pumped now already alive they're
already<00:01:14.930> ready<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.229> contract<00:01:16.149> so<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.299> know

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
already ready to contract so you know

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.880 
already ready to contract so you know
what<00:01:17.630> looks<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:17.869> an<00:01:18.110> incomplete

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
what looks like an incomplete

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.460 
what looks like an incomplete
contraction<00:01:19.490> or<00:01:19.750> let's<00:01:20.750> say<00:01:20.869> an<00:01:20.990> incomplete

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
contraction or let's say an incomplete

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.149 
contraction or let's say an incomplete
full<00:01:22.039> range<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.399> motion<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.710> still<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.920> lot<00:01:25.130> of

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
full range of motion it's still a lot of

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.910 
full range of motion it's still a lot of
contraction<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:25.909> happens<00:01:26.299> when<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.380> break

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
contraction that happens when you break

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.600 
contraction that happens when you break
this<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.720> movement<00:01:30.020> down<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.770> let's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
this this this movement down and let's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.749 
this this this movement down and let's
say<00:01:31.759> as<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.970> become<00:01:32.119> fatigued<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.890> stop<00:01:34.220> fool

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
say as you become fatigued you stop fool

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.029 
say as you become fatigued you stop fool
you<00:01:35.509> cease<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.020> ability<00:01:36.440> from<00:01:36.530> reaching<00:01:36.770> all

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
you cease the ability from reaching all

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.190 
you cease the ability from reaching all
the<00:01:37.069> way<00:01:37.190> forward<00:01:37.490> stretching<00:01:38.420> at<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.810> bottom

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the way forward stretching at the bottom

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.590 
the way forward stretching at the bottom
and<00:01:39.409> then<00:01:39.920> pulling<00:01:40.159> all<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.550> way<00:01:40.640> back<00:01:40.819> you

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and then pulling all the way back you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.779 
and then pulling all the way back you
know<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.869> contract<00:01:42.380> your<00:01:42.470> lats<00:01:42.800> your<00:01:43.220> spinal

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
know to contract your lats your spinal

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.029

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
you go from pulling with command to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.210 
you go from pulling with command to
holding<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.909> here<00:01:56.140> as<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.350> stretch<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:58.009> come

so your spinal erectors and all the
longitude<00:02:16.910> muscles<00:02:17.359> that<00:02:17.480> run<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.650> down

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
longitude muscles that run up and down

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.910 
longitude muscles that run up and down
your<00:02:19.040> spine<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.720> contract<00:02:21.019> just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
your spine they have to contract just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.310 
your spine they have to contract just
the<00:02:22.040> flexors<00:02:22.549> just<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.970> flex<00:02:23.239> your<00:02:23.359> spine<00:02:23.420> in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
the flexors just a flex your spine in

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.870 
the flexors just a flex your spine in
order<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.620> set<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> right

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
order to set you up to be in the right

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
order to set you up to be in the right
position<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.709> evenly<00:02:27.709> you're<00:02:27.920> not<00:02:28.100> pulling

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
position so evenly you're not pulling

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190 
position so evenly you're not pulling
all<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> way<00:02:28.850> back<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.390> point<00:02:29.660> because

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
all the way back at that point because

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.920 
all the way back at that point because
the<00:02:30.530> muscles<00:02:30.709> are<00:02:30.980> fatigued<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.720> can

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the muscles are fatigued you are you can

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.000 
the muscles are fatigued you are you can
failure<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:34.700> reaching<00:02:35.180> failure<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.620> all

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
failure you are reaching failure so all

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.009 
failure you are reaching failure so all
right<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.340> don't<00:02:37.430> get<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> full<00:02:37.880> 20<00:02:38.090> reps<00:02:38.359> at

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
right you don't get the full 20 reps at

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.740 
right you don't get the full 20 reps at
this<00:02:39.290> point<00:02:39.590> that's<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:40.609> want<00:02:40.820> that's
