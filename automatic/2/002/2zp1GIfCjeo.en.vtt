Broncos were successful last week was
due<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.500> fact<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.190> Steelers<00:04:58.520> could

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
due to the fact that the Steelers could

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.030

factor in this game the pass rush was
almost<00:05:25.669> non-existent<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.510> second<00:05:26.870> half

almost non-existent the second half
against<00:05:27.320> Denver<00:05:27.740> largely<00:05:28.039> because<00:05:28.430> Manning

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
against Denver largely because Manning

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.670 
against Denver largely because Manning
was<00:05:28.970> throwing<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.360> ball<00:05:29.539> within<00:05:29.780> two<00:05:30.260> seconds

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
after he received it and didn't give him

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.180 
after he received it and didn't give him
much<00:05:32.720> of<00:05:32.840> an<00:05:33.020> opportunity<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.620> really<00:05:33.860> put<00:05:34.100> any

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
much of an opportunity to really put any

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.460 
much of an opportunity to really put any
pressure<00:05:34.430> on<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.789> quarterback<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.900> get<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.440> a

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
pressure on the quarterback to get to a

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.050 
pressure on the quarterback to get to a
third<00:05:36.830> down<00:05:37.010> situation<00:05:37.250> they're<00:05:37.850> going<00:05:37.970> to

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
third down situation they're going to

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.760 
third down situation they're going to
have<00:05:38.150> to<00:05:38.270> succeed<00:05:38.630> on<00:05:38.810> first<00:05:39.080> and<00:05:39.260> second<00:05:39.620> down

have to succeed on first and second down

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.800 
have to succeed on first and second down
those<00:05:40.400> two<00:05:40.610> things<00:05:40.760> obviously<00:05:41.240> are<00:05:41.419> important

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
those two things obviously are important

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.090 
those two things obviously are important
as<00:05:41.900> well<00:05:41.930> but<00:05:42.320> they<00:05:42.440> need<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.680> finish<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.070> job

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
as well but they need to finish the job

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.070 
as well but they need to finish the job
on<00:05:43.460> third<00:05:43.729> down<00:05:43.940> getting<00:05:44.479> interceptions
