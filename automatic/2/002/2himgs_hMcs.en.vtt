like<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.459> quick<00:02:27.790> arpeggio<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.659> basically

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
like a quick arpeggio on it basically

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:46.370 
like a quick arpeggio on it basically
what<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.590> I'm<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.920> rolling<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> Triads

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.320 

okay<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.740> basically<00:02:48.190> by<00:02:48.640> rolling<00:02:49.150> those

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
okay so basically by rolling those

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.060 
okay so basically by rolling those
triads<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.200> know<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.470> doing<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.770> left

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
triads and you know just doing that left

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.890 
triads and you know just doing that left
right<00:02:51.490> hand<00:02:51.820> thing<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.240> while<00:02:52.420> I'm<00:02:52.540> doing<00:02:52.570> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
left hand right hand like if I'm taking

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.220 
left hand right hand like if I'm taking
let's<00:02:55.090> say<00:02:55.180> my<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> minor<00:02:55.720> chord<00:02:55.930> I'll<00:02:56.080> play

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
let's say my a minor chord I'll play

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.720 
let's say my a minor chord I'll play
like<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> root<00:03:01.470> or<00:03:02.470> if<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.160> want<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> keep<00:03:03.550> it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
like the root or if I want to keep it

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.780 
like the root or if I want to keep it
set<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.600> four<00:03:05.110> notes<00:03:11.250> that's<00:03:12.250> what<00:03:12.460> happens

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
set to four notes that's what happens

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.430 
set to four notes that's what happens
when<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.030> hold<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.390> pedal<00:03:13.720> down<00:03:13.750> hold<00:03:14.350> the

same court but what if you do this see

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.660 
same court but what if you do this see
what<00:03:25.830> happens<00:03:26.070> you're<00:03:26.160> gonna<00:03:26.250> make<00:03:26.400> sure<00:03:26.550> you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
what happens you're gonna make sure you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.040 
what happens you're gonna make sure you
lift<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.060> pedal<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.660> put<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> back<00:03:27.930> down

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
lift that pedal up and put it back down

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.020 
lift that pedal up and put it back down
so<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:31.130> moved<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> different<00:03:32.340> court<00:03:32.820> don't

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
so I moved to a different court don't

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.820 
so I moved to a different court don't
worry<00:03:33.150> about<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.480> court<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:33.960> it's<00:03:34.200> not

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
worry about that court it's it's not

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.590 
worry about that court it's it's not
important<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.580> just<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.850> demonstrate<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
important it's just to demonstrate the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.020 
important it's just to demonstrate the
pedal<00:03:38.570> if<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.690> make<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> mistake<00:03:40.290> right<00:03:41.390> there

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
pedal if you make a mistake right there

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.480 
pedal if you make a mistake right there
like<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.300> hit<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.170> instead<00:03:46.709> well<00:03:47.100> don't<00:03:47.310> keep

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
like I hit that instead well don't keep

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.110 
like I hit that instead well don't keep
the<00:03:47.640> pedal<00:03:47.940> down<00:03:49.130> lift<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.310> pedal<00:03:50.490> up<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.000> it

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
the pedal down lift the pedal up so it

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:06.910 
the pedal down lift the pedal up so it
doesn't<00:03:51.420> ring<00:03:51.870> together

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.910 

down<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.700> left-hand<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.360> lot<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.110> Route<00:04:09.290> tents

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
down the left-hand a lot of Route tents

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.460 
down the left-hand a lot of Route tents
a<00:04:10.069> lot<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.550> root<00:04:10.760> root<00:04:11.060> root<00:04:11.450> five<00:04:11.900> root<00:04:12.200> root

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
a lot of root root root five root root

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.300 
a lot of root root root five root root
five<00:04:12.709> ten

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.580 

you<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.430> also<00:04:18.580> do<00:04:18.850> these<00:04:19.030> like<00:04:19.480> arpeggios<00:04:20.440> in

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
you can also do these like arpeggios in

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.920 
you can also do these like arpeggios in
which<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.920> take<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.489> same<00:04:22.000> chord<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.750> then

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
which you take the same chord and then

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.110 
which you take the same chord and then
you<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.530> left<00:04:23.860> hand<00:04:24.160> first<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.820> then<00:04:24.910> right

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you know left hand first and then right

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:38.290 
you know left hand first and then right
hand<00:04:25.360> so

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:57.430 

ah

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
all right so as you mess around with

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.260 
all right so as you mess around with
those<00:05:00.890> triads<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.580> trying<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.880> get<00:05:02.000> some<00:05:02.180> of

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
those triads and trying to get some of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.300 
those triads and trying to get some of
that<00:05:02.300> flowing<00:05:02.900> stuff<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:03.590> you're<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.800> beginner

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that flowing stuff if you're a beginner

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.890 
that flowing stuff if you're a beginner
you're<00:05:04.550> gonna<00:05:04.700> notice<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.180> yeah<00:05:05.480> I'll<00:05:05.690> take

a little little take a little while took
a<00:05:07.430> few<00:05:07.700> weeks<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.030> if<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.240> practice<00:05:08.720> that

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
a few weeks but if you practice that

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.960 
a few weeks but if you practice that
you'll<00:05:09.440> be<00:05:09.620> able<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.920> like<00:05:10.070> start<00:05:10.400> to<00:05:10.550> put<00:05:10.760> some

you'll be able to like start to put some
of<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.120> stuff<00:05:11.210> in<00:05:11.570> your<00:05:11.660> play<00:05:11.900> once<00:05:12.500> again

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
of that stuff in your play once again

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.770 
of that stuff in your play once again
let<00:05:12.890> me<00:05:13.010> make<00:05:13.340> sure<00:05:13.760> I'm<00:05:14.030> being<00:05:14.210> very<00:05:14.450> clear

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
let me make sure I'm being very clear

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.590 
let me make sure I'm being very clear
start<00:05:15.590> with<00:05:15.770> just<00:05:15.980> your<00:05:16.220> basic<00:05:16.750> triad<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.140> I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
start with just your basic triad so I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.820 
start with just your basic triad so I
did<00:05:20.600> root<00:05:20.780> five<00:05:20.990> root<00:05:21.200> down<00:05:21.380> here<00:05:21.590> then<00:05:21.740> I'm

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
did root five root down here then I'm

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.640 
did root five root down here then I'm
going<00:05:21.950> to<00:05:22.010> go<00:05:22.100> just<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.400> triads<00:05:23.500> sorry

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.430 

it's<00:05:28.650> my<00:05:28.830> first<00:05:29.100> one<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.930> can<00:05:30.930> do<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.140> try<00:05:31.320> out

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
it's my first one I can do to try out

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.860 
it's my first one I can do to try out
here<00:05:31.650> as<00:05:31.740> well<00:05:31.890> if<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.100> won

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
here as well if I won

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.240 
here as well if I won
so<00:05:33.870> I'm<00:05:33.960> doing<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.320> try<00:05:34.560> it<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.860> right<00:05:35.040> hand

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
so I'm doing a try it in the right hand

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.040 
so I'm doing a try it in the right hand
it's<00:05:35.400> still<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.850> rest<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.420> seventh<00:05:36.840> chord

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
it's still the rest of the seventh chord

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.870 
it's still the rest of the seventh chord
though<00:05:37.260> right<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.010> don't<00:05:38.280> have<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.610> go<00:05:38.700> down

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
though right so I don't have to go down

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.610 
though right so I don't have to go down
to<00:05:39.060> B<00:05:39.240> minor<00:05:39.480> seven<00:05:39.810> flat<00:05:39.840> five<00:05:40.020> like<00:05:40.380> that

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
to B minor seven flat five like that

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.269 
to B minor seven flat five like that
it's<00:05:41.160> still<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.210> don't<00:05:42.360> have<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.540> do<00:05:42.660> that

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.819 

which<00:05:46.879> I<00:05:46.999> could<00:05:47.299> do<00:05:47.509> that<00:05:47.959> but<00:05:48.199> sometimes<00:05:48.589> it's

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:48.829 
which I could do that but sometimes it's

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.799 
which I could do that but sometimes it's
a<00:05:48.949> little<00:05:48.979> difficult<00:05:49.459> when<00:05:50.059> you<00:05:50.209> have<00:05:50.239> to<00:05:50.569> hit

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:50.809 
a little difficult when you have to hit

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.849 
a little difficult when you have to hit
that<00:05:50.839> B<00:05:52.899> you<00:05:53.899> gotta<00:05:54.049> hit<00:05:54.169> that<00:05:54.349> same<00:05:54.619> note

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:54.859 
that B you gotta hit that same note

00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:57.759 
that B you gotta hit that same note
again<00:05:55.359> so<00:05:56.359> just<00:05:56.899> do<00:05:56.989> the<00:05:57.109> rest<00:05:57.289> of<00:05:57.379> the<00:05:57.439> seventh

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:57.769 
again so just do the rest of the seventh

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:02.219 
again so just do the rest of the seventh
chord

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.659 

you<00:06:03.229> want<00:06:03.380> to<00:06:03.470> add<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:03.740> more<00:06:03.979> notes<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.460> can<00:06:04.520> do

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
you want to add on more notes you can do

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:25.389 
you want to add on more notes you can do
that<00:06:04.850> as<00:06:04.970> well<00:06:05.650> so

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:25.399 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:07:05.040 

you<00:06:26.399> just<00:06:26.610> move<00:06:27.119> right<00:06:27.330> on

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.020 

there<00:07:06.039> was<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.639> minor<00:07:07.270> to<00:07:07.810> B<00:07:07.990> flat<00:07:08.199> to<00:07:08.560> E<00:07:09.099> E<00:07:09.580> flat

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
there was a minor to B flat to E E flat

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:18.600 
there was a minor to B flat to E E flat
in<00:07:10.330> it<00:07:10.509> and<00:07:10.840> an<00:07:11.590> e7<00:07:12.400> and<00:07:15.870> so<00:07:16.870> anyway<00:07:17.650> I<00:07:17.889> have<00:07:18.370> fun

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
in it and an e7 and so anyway I have fun

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.580 
in it and an e7 and so anyway I have fun
with<00:07:18.759> that<00:07:18.879> I'll<00:07:19.300> see<00:07:19.599> you<00:07:19.780> in<00:07:20.289> the<00:07:20.379> next
