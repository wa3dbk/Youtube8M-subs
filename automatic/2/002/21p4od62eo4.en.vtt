I'll be showing you how to make a
pop-out<00:00:09.300> staircase<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.170> very<00:00:10.590> simple<00:00:10.860> flip

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
pop-out staircase it's very simple flip

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.910 
pop-out staircase it's very simple flip
the<00:00:11.400> lever<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.139> these<00:00:13.139> blocks<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.590> pop<00:00:13.769> out

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the lever and these blocks will pop out

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.689 
the lever and these blocks will pop out
flip<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.610> back<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.560> they'll<00:00:16.560> pop<00:00:16.770> back<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
flip it back up they'll pop back in I

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880 
flip it back up they'll pop back in I
just<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.660> two<00:00:18.840> examples<00:00:19.320> right<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.500> you

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
just have two examples right here you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470 
just have two examples right here you
could<00:00:20.070> use<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> regular<00:00:20.880> wooden<00:00:21.210> stairs

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
could use the regular wooden stairs

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660 
could use the regular wooden stairs
right<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.930> or<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.769> could<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:22.980> actual

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
right here or you could use actual

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
right here or you could use actual
blocks<00:00:23.970> right<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> more<00:00:25.199> flat<00:00:25.529> thing

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
blocks right here for a more flat thing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
blocks right here for a more flat thing
but<00:00:26.670> yeah<00:00:27.619> come<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.650> oh<00:00:29.150> nice<00:00:30.150> view<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:31.410> gonna

sleep really quick and let's get on to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
sleep really quick and let's get on to
actually<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:38.120> this<00:00:39.120> could

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
actually how you make this so this could

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.479 
actually how you make this so this could
be<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> cool<00:00:40.200> entrance<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:40.920> base<00:00:41.160> if

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
be like a cool entrance to your base if

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
be like a cool entrance to your base if
you<00:00:41.640> had<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> flat<00:00:42.510> wall<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you had just like a flat wall here and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
you had just like a flat wall here and
then<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> had<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.350> flip<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
then it to get in you had to flip the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.090 
then it to get in you had to flip the
lever<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.590> stuff<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.070> block

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
lever and I have out stuff here to block

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.360 
lever and I have out stuff here to block
these<00:00:50.399> Pistons<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.050> extended<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
these Pistons when it's extended out so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
these Pistons when it's extended out so
it<00:00:53.430> looks<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.820> nicer<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.379> yeah<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.750> over

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it looks a bit nicer but yeah so over

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
it looks a bit nicer but yeah so over
here<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> skeleton<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.399> this<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.420> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
here I have the skeleton of this or just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.720 
here I have the skeleton of this or just
like<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.960> footprint<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.039> whatever<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> want

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

like the footprint or whatever you want
to<00:01:02.789> call<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.280> too<00:01:05.610> large

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
to call it to not to it's not too large

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
to call it to not to it's not too large
fairly<00:01:07.229> compact<00:01:07.560> again<00:01:08.750> stands<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:11.150> extends

need glowstone because they have special
redstone<00:02:01.810> properties<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.400> not<00:02:03.550> going<00:02:03.670> to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
redstone properties but I'm not going to

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.910 
redstone properties but I'm not going to
go<00:02:03.850> into<00:02:03.970> how<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.869> actually<00:02:05.020> works<00:02:05.410> you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
works but now we have our glowstone

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.500 
works but now we have our glowstone
right<00:02:11.380> here<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.850> just<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> same<00:02:13.090> thing<00:02:13.390> on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
right here and just do the same thing on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.570 
right here and just do the same thing on
the<00:02:13.600> same<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.260> same<00:02:14.860> exact<00:02:15.160> side<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the same time on the same exact side and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.620 
the same time on the same exact side and
then<00:02:16.150> now<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.720> repeater<00:02:17.170> timing<00:02:17.890> set<00:02:18.160> these

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
then now for repeater timing set these

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.920 
then now for repeater timing set these
24<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.930> middle<00:02:20.620> ones<00:02:21.030> 23<00:02:22.030> okay<00:02:22.570> you're

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
24 and the middle ones 23 okay you're

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.199 
24 and the middle ones 23 okay you're
going<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> add<00:02:23.320> torches<00:02:23.800> right<00:02:23.980> here<00:02:24.400> right

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
going to add torches right here right

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.750 
going to add torches right here right
here<00:02:25.239> on<00:02:25.540> all<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.989> orange<00:02:26.980> wool<00:02:27.340> right<00:02:27.550> there

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
here on all the orange wool right there

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.130 
here on all the orange wool right there
and<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.239> can

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
and then you can

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.200 
and then you can
add<00:02:29.590> wool<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.069> top<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.580> doesn't<00:02:31.090> really

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
add wool on top of this doesn't really

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.000 
add wool on top of this doesn't really
matter<00:02:31.450> right<00:02:32.580> there<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.840> there<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.680> then

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
matter right there right there and then

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
matter right there right there and then
now<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.580> add<00:02:36.760> your<00:02:36.970> redstone<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:38.319> wire

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
now just add your redstone so just wire

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.380 
now just add your redstone so just wire
it<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:39.250> up

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it all up

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.380 
it all up
and<00:02:41.690> then<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.069> go<00:02:43.280> straight<00:02:43.819> into<00:02:43.970> the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
and then have this go straight into the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.480 
and then have this go straight into the
block<00:02:45.200> with<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.410> torch<00:02:45.740> on<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.069> right<00:02:46.280> there

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
block with the torch on it right there

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.790 
block with the torch on it right there
so<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> same<00:02:47.840> thing<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> same<00:02:48.500> side

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
so do the same thing on the same side

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.740 
so do the same thing on the same side
now<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:51.620> one<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.130> right<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:52.819> like<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
now have one up right here like that and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.600 
now have one up right here like that and
then<00:02:54.230> you're<00:02:54.560> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.800> want<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.069> add<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.250> torch

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
then you're going to want to add a torch

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.120 
then you're going to want to add a torch
right<00:02:56.300> there<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.780> then<00:02:57.700> pistons<00:02:58.700> right<00:02:59.510> here

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
right there and then pistons right here

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.350 
right there and then pistons right here
have<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:01.340> block<00:03:01.610> I'm<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.030> going<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.240> use

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
have your block I'm just going to use

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.510 
have your block I'm just going to use
iron<00:03:02.780> right<00:03:02.959> there<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.380> then<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> quick

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
iron right there and then as a quick

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.790 
iron right there and then as a quick
example<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.540> know<00:03:06.110> if<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.500> flip<00:03:06.709> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
example if you know if you flip the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.390 
example if you know if you flip the
lever<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.640> looks<00:03:07.820> 10<00:03:08.030> doubt<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:10.100> mess<00:03:10.370> up

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
lever it looks 10 doubt then I mess up

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.820 
lever it looks 10 doubt then I mess up
the<00:03:10.640> GUP<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.120> let<00:03:11.480> me<00:03:11.569> just<00:03:11.720> check<00:03:11.989> everything

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the GUP so let me just check everything

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.440 
the GUP so let me just check everything
it<00:03:13.160> did<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.610> make<00:03:13.760> sure<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.030> did<00:03:14.209> everything

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
it did and make sure it did everything

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.010 
it did and make sure it did everything
right<00:03:15.459> looks<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.820> did<00:03:16.880> everything<00:03:17.630> right

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
right looks like I did everything right

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.119 
out two blocks two blocks you can remove
this<00:04:03.480> you're<00:04:04.319> going<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.620> two<00:04:04.799> repeaters

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
this you're going to have two repeaters

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.069 
this you're going to have two repeaters
here<00:04:05.459> these<00:04:05.910> repeaters<00:04:06.329> are<00:04:06.480> here<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.840> make<00:04:06.959> it

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
here these repeaters are here to make it

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.280 
here these repeaters are here to make it
look<00:04:07.260> nicer<00:04:07.670> set<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> four<00:04:09.000> tix<00:04:09.299> on<00:04:09.540> both

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
look nicer set the four tix on both

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.170 
look nicer set the four tix on both
sides<00:04:10.620> here<00:04:10.980> stand<00:04:11.879> one<00:04:12.060> oats<00:04:12.239> one<00:04:12.930> more<00:04:13.140> add<00:04:14.180> a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
sides here stand one oats one more add a

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.000 
sides here stand one oats one more add a
little<00:04:16.079> dip<00:04:16.590> here

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
little dip here

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.490 
little dip here
and<00:04:18.100> add<00:04:18.520> your<00:04:18.910> redstone<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:20.080> here<00:04:20.320> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
and add your redstone it right here and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.700 
and add your redstone it right here and
then<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.850> could<00:04:22.000> add<00:04:22.210> another<00:04:22.600> your<00:04:23.500> other

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
then you could add another your other

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.910 
then you could add another your other
blocks<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.310> top<00:04:24.370> like<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.480> then<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.680> can

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
blocks on top like this and then you can

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.050 
blocks on top like this and then you can
extend<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.610> out<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.030> course<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:29.470> this
