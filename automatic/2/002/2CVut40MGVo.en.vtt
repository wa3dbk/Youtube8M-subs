corpse guardians and led read those are

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.660 
corpse guardians and led read those are
pretty<00:03:13.200> big<00:03:13.319> titles<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.920> actually<00:03:14.129> picked<00:03:14.519> up

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
pretty big titles I actually picked up

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.360 
pretty big titles I actually picked up
all<00:03:14.939> of<00:03:15.120> them<00:03:15.269> before<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.840> read<00:03:16.260> them<00:03:16.470> several

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
all of them before and read them several

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.220 
all of them before and read them several
issues<00:03:17.489> deep<00:03:17.879> so<00:03:18.419> it's<00:03:18.540> conscious<00:03:18.720> appointing

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
issues deep so it's conscious appointing

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.599 
issues deep so it's conscious appointing
to<00:03:19.290> see<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.620> they're<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.919> canceling<00:03:20.459> them

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
to see that they're just canceling them

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.789 
to see that they're just canceling them
but<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.239> worry<00:03:21.569> they're<00:03:22.319> obviously<00:03:22.500> not

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
but don't worry they're obviously not

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.420 
but don't worry they're obviously not
canceling<00:03:23.549> what<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.120> think<00:03:24.449> 16<00:03:25.199> total<00:03:25.560> comic

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
canceling what I think 16 total comic

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.729 
canceling what I think 16 total comic
books<00:03:26.639> 3<00:03:27.000> than<00:03:27.180> being<00:03:27.359> weeklies<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.019> not

books 3 than being weeklies and not
returning<00:03:29.190> them<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.579> basically<00:03:29.819> what's<00:03:30.030> going

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
returning them so basically what's going

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.050

this convergence now convergence is

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.250 
this convergence now convergence is
literally<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.340> two<00:03:35.430> month<00:03:36.000> period<00:03:36.090> where<00:03:36.959> all

up<00:03:46.409> convergence<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.340> mean<00:03:47.699> uh<00:03:47.879> pretty<00:03:48.120> much<00:03:48.150> be

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
up convergence I mean uh pretty much be

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059 
up convergence I mean uh pretty much be
picking<00:03:48.629> up<00:03:48.720> every<00:03:49.229> conversion<00:03:49.709> title

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
picking up every conversion title

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.860 
picking up every conversion title
without<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.519> doubt<00:03:50.849> but<00:03:51.299> pretty<00:03:51.599> much<00:03:51.659> what's

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
without a doubt but pretty much what's

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.390 
without a doubt but pretty much what's
going<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.049> happen<00:03:52.379> after<00:03:52.739> conversions<00:03:53.250> as

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
going to happen after conversions as

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.909 
going to happen after conversions as
DC's<00:03:53.819> gonna<00:03:54.060> most<00:03:54.720> likely<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.349> small

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
DC's gonna most likely have a small

DC's gonna most likely have a small
reboot<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:56.549> they're<00:03:57.060> canceling<00:03:57.510> all<00:03:57.629> these

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
reboot now they're canceling all these

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.750 
reboot now they're canceling all these
titles<00:03:58.139> probably<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:59.099> a<00:03:59.129> fresh<00:03:59.549> new

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
titles probably to have a fresh new

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.270 
titles probably to have a fresh new
start<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.540> pretty<00:04:00.690> much<00:04:00.780> every<00:04:01.199> title<00:04:01.409> that<00:04:02.010> is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280

start so pretty much every title that is
it<00:04:02.459> wasn't<00:04:02.760> cancelled<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> doing<00:04:04.109> somewhat

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it wasn't cancelled is doing somewhat

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.740 
it wasn't cancelled is doing somewhat
pretty<00:04:04.949> well<00:04:05.159> and<00:04:05.370> honestly<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:06.419> a<00:04:06.569> lot<00:04:06.720> of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
pretty well and honestly that's a lot of

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.449 
pretty well and honestly that's a lot of
titles<00:04:07.109> so<00:04:07.290> none<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:07.859> these<00:04:08.040> titles<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.430> have

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
titles so none of these titles that have

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.069 
titles so none of these titles that have
been<00:04:08.699> cancelled<00:04:09.180> actually<00:04:09.690> I've<00:04:09.930> been

disappointed but I'm really confused on
why<00:04:13.979> they're<00:04:14.159> canceling<00:04:14.639> three<00:04:14.879> green

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
why they're canceling three green

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.180 
why they're canceling three green
lantern<00:04:15.540> titles<00:04:15.959> or<00:04:16.139> i<00:04:16.169> should<00:04:16.349> say<00:04:16.530> lantern

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190

you're not just some guy in a bat
costume<00:04:20.520> are<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:25.370> my<00:04:26.370> guess<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:26.790> when<00:04:27.060> we

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
costume are you my guess is that when we

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.150 
costume are you my guess is that when we
do<00:04:27.360> get<00:04:27.540> our<00:04:27.690> new<00:04:27.870> titles<00:04:28.260> we're<00:04:28.860> gonna<00:04:28.950> have

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
do get our new titles we're gonna have

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
do get our new titles we're gonna have
different<00:04:29.880> Green<00:04:30.330> Lantern<00:04:30.660> titles<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.320> we

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
different Green Lantern titles so we

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.680 
different Green Lantern titles so we
have<00:04:31.680> what<00:04:31.950> corpse<00:04:32.370> new<00:04:33.000> guardians<00:04:33.480> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
have what corpse new guardians and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.880 
have what corpse new guardians and
lanterns<00:04:34.080> now<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.290> don't<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.710> what<00:04:34.860> happened

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.920 
lanterns now I don't know what happened
at<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.430> end<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.670> Godhead<00:04:36.210> i'm<00:04:36.540> pretty<00:04:36.780> sure

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
at the end of Godhead i'm pretty sure

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.900 
at the end of Godhead i'm pretty sure
that<00:04:36.960> met<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.440> still<00:04:37.710> going<00:04:37.920> on<00:04:38.220> I'm<00:04:38.580> not

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
that met is still going on I'm not

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.490 
that met is still going on I'm not
currently<00:04:39.150> reading<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.780> seems<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.260> it's<00:04:40.410> a

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
currently reading it seems like it's a

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.590 
currently reading it seems like it's a
really<00:04:40.800> really<00:04:41.130> big<00:04:41.400> event<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.210> probably

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
really really big event so probably

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.330 
really really big event so probably
gonna<00:04:42.750> pick<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.050> up<00:04:43.170> after<00:04:43.530> when<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:44.220> in

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
gonna pick it up after when it's in

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.850 
gonna pick it up after when it's in
trade<00:04:44.670> but<00:04:45.210> I'm<00:04:45.450> thinking<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.500> what<00:04:46.740> we're

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
trade but I'm thinking that what we're

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.400 
trade but I'm thinking that what we're
gonna<00:04:46.950> see<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.340> like<00:04:47.490> Green<00:04:47.820> Lantern

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
gonna see is like Green Lantern

events going all over there because it's

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.580 
events going all over there because it's
literally<00:05:57.660> opposite<00:05:58.230> side<00:05:58.380> of<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.530> universe

or this defense happening over there now

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.660 
or this defense happening over there now
obviously<00:06:01.770> something<00:06:02.100> huge<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.370> going<00:06:02.520> to<00:06:02.580> go

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
obviously something huge is going to go

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.280 
obviously something huge is going to go
on<00:06:02.700> with<00:06:03.150> Hal<00:06:03.360> Jordan<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:03.960> Green<00:06:04.200> Lantern

convergence<00:06:07.110> will<00:06:07.320> probably<00:06:07.650> see<00:06:07.770> more<00:06:08.010> of<00:06:08.100> it

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
convergence will probably see more of it

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.220 
convergence will probably see more of it
during<00:06:08.460> conversion<00:06:08.760> so<00:06:09.210> whatever<00:06:09.870> happens

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
during conversion so whatever happens

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.570 
during conversion so whatever happens
then<00:06:10.380> of<00:06:10.500> course<00:06:10.680> is<00:06:10.800> going<00:06:10.920> to<00:06:10.980> affect<00:06:11.400> what

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
then of course is going to affect what

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.400 
then of course is going to affect what
we<00:06:11.700> actually<00:06:11.880> get<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.210> see<00:06:12.450> after<00:06:12.840> but<00:06:13.290> we're

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
we actually get to see after but we're

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.870 
we actually get to see after but we're
gonna<00:06:13.500> be<00:06:13.650> seeing<00:06:13.800> those<00:06:13.950> solicitations<00:06:14.190> and

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
gonna be seeing those solicitations and

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.120 
gonna be seeing those solicitations and
I<00:06:14.970> think<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.780> month<00:06:16.140> or<00:06:16.290> two<00:06:16.320> so<00:06:16.770> we<00:06:16.860> eventually

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
I think a month or two so we eventually

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.920 
I think a month or two so we eventually
we'll<00:06:17.400> find<00:06:17.610> out<00:06:17.790> what<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.390> new<00:06:18.510> titles<00:06:18.840> will

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
we'll find out what the new titles will

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.870 
we'll find out what the new titles will
be<00:06:18.960> I'm<00:06:19.470> just<00:06:19.860> here<00:06:19.950> to<00:06:19.980> tell<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.760> know

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
be I'm just here to tell you you know

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.360 
be I'm just here to tell you you know
what<00:06:21.120> titles<00:06:21.510> cancelled<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.170> my<00:06:22.860> thoughts<00:06:23.190> on

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
what titles cancelled and my thoughts on

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.250 
what titles cancelled and my thoughts on
the<00:06:23.490> Green<00:06:23.640> Lantern<00:06:23.760> cancellations<00:06:24.690> my<00:06:25.020> guess

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
the Green Lantern cancellations my guess

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.820 
the Green Lantern cancellations my guess
is<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.470> we're

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
is that we're

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.520 
is that we're
three<00:06:26.610> new<00:06:26.790> you<00:06:27.240> know<00:06:27.360> titles<00:06:27.960> with<00:06:28.140> lanterns

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
three new you know titles with lanterns

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.720 
three new you know titles with lanterns
they're<00:06:28.950> probably<00:06:29.250> going<00:06:29.430> to<00:06:29.520> be<00:06:29.580> more

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
they're probably going to be more

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.820 
they're probably going to be more
separate<00:06:30.210> and<00:06:30.390> not<00:06:30.750> more<00:06:30.900> tied<00:06:31.170> together<00:06:31.380> into

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
separate and not more tied together into

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.280 
separate and not more tied together into
basically<00:06:32.250> one<00:06:32.760> massive<00:06:33.060> comic<00:06:33.630> per<00:06:34.020> month

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
basically one massive comic per month

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.900 
basically one massive comic per month
that's<00:06:34.740> basically<00:06:35.040> how<00:06:35.370> it<00:06:35.490> worked<00:06:35.790> the

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
that's basically how it worked the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.280 
that's basically how it worked the
mossville<00:06:36.210> just<00:06:36.360> had<00:06:36.450> a<00:06:36.480> weekly<00:06:36.930> you<00:06:37.170> know

mossville just had a weekly you know
really<00:06:38.070> I<00:06:38.190> mean<00:06:38.310> it<00:06:38.400> was<00:06:38.460> pretty<00:06:38.640> cool<00:06:38.820> green

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180

lantern<00:06:39.510> weekly<00:06:39.930> I<00:06:40.110> mean<00:06:40.860> I'm<00:06:41.160> down<00:06:41.820> for<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.210> if

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
lantern weekly I mean I'm down for it if

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.630 
lantern weekly I mean I'm down for it if
it<00:06:42.960> was<00:06:43.050> a<00:06:43.080> really<00:06:43.320> good<00:06:43.560> story<00:06:43.830> but<00:06:44.160> there's

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
it was a really good story but there's

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640 
it was a really good story but there's
just<00:06:44.700> there's<00:06:44.940> so<00:06:45.240> much<00:06:45.420> going<00:06:45.630> on<00:06:45.870> in<00:06:46.080> like

just there's so much going on in like

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.200

the<00:06:46.770> lantern<00:06:47.070> universe<00:06:47.400> itself<00:06:47.760> and<00:06:48.060> so

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
the lantern universe itself and so

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.000 
the lantern universe itself and so
popular<00:06:48.750> and<00:06:48.960> there's<00:06:49.350> so<00:06:49.410> many<00:06:49.500> characters

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
popular and there's so many characters

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.700 
popular and there's so many characters
that<00:06:50.190> a<00:06:50.250> weekly<00:06:50.640> could<00:06:51.090> be<00:06:51.270> pretty<00:06:52.080> easy<00:06:52.140> like

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
that a weekly could be pretty easy like
