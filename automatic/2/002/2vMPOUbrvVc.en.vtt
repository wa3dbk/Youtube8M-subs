00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.210
 Hi people and heart of our new video camcorder 10 today is about the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 Following years hairdresser Coe 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.789
 in 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.189
 The intended use of a barber results in a fall from the name 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.000
 at the Fraser as yes 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.320
 "It's a one percent duty on the bait 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 and it stands out that is not just a passive and fullness that is 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.720
 he has and not just these slats 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.140
 but he has too 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.170
 2 other connections which are painted for active water cooling the flowers 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.470
 I'll be a tree with me someday but not only now 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.899
 with air cooling 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.410
 and passive cooling 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.110
 that means you have to wait a bit of pop there anyway 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 ten Adam Frieser today before first 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.940
 unlike others 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.870
 there 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 This cool element is now in black Ermisch Bartz has the color 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.729
 Black has a few special properties 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.900
 as far as the infrared range is concerned, I suspect 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.000
 that Mrs Beer's point of view has been thinking about it because of course 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.790
 is also important for active cooling 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.610
 and therefore deliberately chose the color black 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.280
 i can remember others at the cooler the in 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.850
 but it does not sound like Hamlet blue or green at least 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.660
 Trying to establish the market, this one is here 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.790
 neutral black 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 as far as I know, they are also appropriate 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 the black materialist is fourth in aluminum which is black on the left 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.810
 and the sample and connection Thuringia are killing 8 millimeters 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.990
 which fit on the cooler we install the Dr 3d of the second ddp 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 so I was able to jump during the whole and am immediately thinking 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 After I've always increased in the cooler results in the following 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 Picture you have two side panels each commanded with a white key 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.170
 which is still protected and to this Werner Leipert 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.249
 and so he needed to substitute the body ect 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.319
 In my case I use a bit of time 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.089
 maybe this is how it works here too 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.199
 He would not be able to fit properly into the rectum Cola without further ado 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.069
 therefore 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.779
 you need to 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.879
 as well as a man have Mr. Hopp 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.379
 around this Bernert what their budget as middle as possible saying 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.099
 at the first to not synonymous with properly brought now not yet 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.829
 but that is not a problem we can deduct the Werner Leipold again and again 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.719
 and give it up again 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.109
 even after he has iPad, I hope he sits properly 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.430
 there is not much left to do now he would have to 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:00.189
 Take one of the side panels and watch it carefully as shown in the picture 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.310
 the slide from the actual Pty 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.459
 remove each foil 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.509
 so and then once in the case now 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:12.249
 Turn the frame around and put it in the middle as possible 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.409
 also put 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.499
 why why I do not forget one as possible 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.179
 in Munich finally have to bring back on a motherboard 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.879
 and your motherboard has left and right 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.059
 integrate small Hayat AFP 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.380
 to issue the current one 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.950
 and they should not be obstructed by Parliament 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.149
 Now, finally, the other side is in sharp focus, he represented 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.149
 just remove the film first 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:46.640
 then 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.629
 very easily 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.629
 also put 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.019
 Gossan press and the whole thing died and that's it 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.299
 so it is the second page exactly where it belongs now I look 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.099
 the whole one still probably say 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.930
 Incidentally, two such frames Color can also be side by side 

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:21.900
 attach Â«There are no space problems 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.029
 So now he is sitting on the causeway with the frame because peace is heard and he sees 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.800
 that is not a problem 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.280
 In addition, now comes to the fact that the cooling even if they now first 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.600
 only passive will be quite good because the majority is still pure NHC 14 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.999
 enough 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.659
 Escape through the area and blows her team to achieve black slats 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.800
 the wars too i hope you had Zuma fall and see you at 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.729
 next time chips or motorcycle 10
