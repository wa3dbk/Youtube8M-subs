a lot of you know watch on it and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
a lot of you know watch on it and
obviously<00:01:15.540> wouldn't<00:01:16.350> want<00:01:17.060> random<00:01:18.060> people

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
obviously wouldn't want random people

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
obviously wouldn't want random people
just<00:01:18.540> walking<00:01:18.750> across<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.580> that's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> best

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
just walking across it that's the best

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.950 
just walking across it that's the best
way<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.240> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.810> know

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.950 

you<00:01:26.960> could<00:01:27.110> get<00:01:27.230> closer<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.830> think<00:01:28.100> a

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
you could get closer but I think a

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.490 
you could get closer but I think a
pretty<00:01:29.960> good<00:01:30.140> idea<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:30.620> location<00:01:35.500> it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
pretty good idea of this location it's

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.980 
pretty good idea of this location it's
really<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.040> good<00:01:37.610> condition<00:01:38.120> I<00:01:38.300> mean<00:01:38.900> the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
really a good condition I mean the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.770 
really a good condition I mean the
brickwork<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.830> almost<00:01:40.820> completely<00:01:41.180> intact<00:01:41.570> it

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
brickwork is almost completely intact it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.120 
brickwork is almost completely intact it
almost<00:01:41.930> looks<00:01:42.170> like<00:01:42.230> they<00:01:42.410> put<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.590> new<00:01:42.740> roof<00:01:42.920> on

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
almost looks like they put a new roof on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.400 
almost looks like they put a new roof on
it<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.430> think<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:43.760> aluminum<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.380> a

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
it I think it's aluminum it's like a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.460 
it I think it's aluminum it's like a
green<00:01:45.800> aluminum<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.870> definitely<00:01:48.110> helped

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
green aluminum so that definitely helped

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.810 
green aluminum so that definitely helped
preserve<00:01:48.650> this<00:01:48.950> building

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.300 

I<00:01:51.940> don't<00:01:52.510> think<00:01:52.540> people<00:01:52.780> like<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.800> car<00:01:54.040> or

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
I don't think people like the car or

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.550 
I don't think people like the car or
city<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.820> road<00:01:55.030> right<00:01:55.300> behind<00:01:55.540> me<00:01:55.780> having

to pass it oh well just to give you an

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.440 
to pass it oh well just to give you an
idea<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.290> surroundings<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.300> really

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
idea of the surroundings it's a really

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.710
