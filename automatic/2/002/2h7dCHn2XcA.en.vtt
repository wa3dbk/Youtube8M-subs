00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
don't care for more it really blows up

that<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> guys<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.190> performance

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that do you guys look for performance

that do you guys look for performance
upgrades<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.660> motors<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.620> happy

with<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> exact<00:01:14.820> horsepower<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.510> has<00:01:15.660> no

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
with the exact horsepower that it has no

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
with the exact horsepower that it has no
it's<00:01:16.380> definitely<00:01:16.740> pumped<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.490> but

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
it's definitely pumped up you know but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.950 
it's definitely pumped up you know but
you<00:01:17.940> still<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.690> reliability

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you still have to have some reliability

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
you still have to have some reliability
you<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.830> blower<00:01:20.010> motor<00:01:20.280> depending<00:01:20.760> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
you know your blower motor depending on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.400 
you know your blower motor depending on
where<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.510> Red<00:01:21.869> Bull<00:01:21.900> Air<00:01:22.200> Race

where you're at like a Red Bull Air Race
a<00:01:22.440> lot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> times<00:01:23.040> r<00:01:23.130> over<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> water<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:24.330> over

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a lot of times r over the water or over

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.540 
a lot of times r over the water or over
very<00:01:24.810> rugged<00:01:25.050> terrain<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.979> blow<00:01:26.160> an<00:01:26.280> engine

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
very rugged terrain so we blow an engine

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.770 
very rugged terrain so we blow an engine
we<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.970> pull<00:01:27.149> off<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> side<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we don't just pull off to the side I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
we don't just pull off to the side I
mean<00:01:28.020> you're<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.259> big<00:01:28.500> trouble<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:31.020> 1,400

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
mean you're in big trouble with 1,400

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.070 
mean you're in big trouble with 1,400
horsepower<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.520> go<00:01:32.610> 200<00:01:32.820> miles<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
horsepower when we go 200 miles in a

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.560 
horsepower when we go 200 miles in a
plane<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.369> 300<00:01:35.850> yeah<00:01:36.000> 300<00:01:36.420> horse

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
plane you say that 300 yeah 300 horse

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
plane you say that 300 yeah 300 horse
show<00:01:36.750> 300<00:01:37.380> mile<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.619> hour<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.310> about

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
show 300 mile an hour it's all about

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030 
show 300 mile an hour it's all about
aerodynamics<00:01:38.790> yeah<00:01:39.360> Jeff<00:01:40.290> maybe<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:40.920> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
aerodynamics yeah Jeff maybe we get this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.620 
aerodynamics yeah Jeff maybe we get this
thing<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.640> win<00:01:41.729> Tommy<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.360> going

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
thing back in and win Tommy I'm going

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.780 
from zero mile an hour he's coming in at
I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.300> he<00:01:45.390> said<00:01:45.630> 120<00:01:46.619> mile<00:01:47.070> an<00:01:47.190> hour<00:01:47.310> it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
I think he said 120 mile an hour it's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639 
I think he said 120 mile an hour it's
gonna<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.030> pretty<00:01:48.149> cool<00:01:48.390> man<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.869> hope<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.530> see
