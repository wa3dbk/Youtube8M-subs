00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
basically a bunch of distorted 808s

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.240 
basically a bunch of distorted 808s
they're<00:01:43.880> all<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.240> same<00:01:44.270> pitch<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.110> each<00:01:45.890> one

they're all the same pitch and each one
has<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.520> different<00:01:46.640> process<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.100> really

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
has a different process but it's really

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.100 
has a different process but it's really
cool<00:01:49.520> way<00:01:49.730> because<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.510> lot<00:01:50.660> of<00:01:50.690> times<00:01:50.930> I'll

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
cool way because a lot of times I'll

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.660 
cool way because a lot of times I'll
spend<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.500> good<00:01:51.770> amount<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:52.100> time<00:01:52.280> just<00:01:52.580> trying

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670

kid I'll show you is this base

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.420 
kid I'll show you is this base
distortion<00:02:08.570> stab<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:12.680> kind<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.040> stabby

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.000 
distortion stab it's kind of a stabby
base<00:02:14.030> thing<00:02:14.360> then<00:02:14.930> I've<00:02:15.050> got<00:02:15.080> several<00:02:15.530> EMU

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
base thing then I've got several EMU

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.400 
base thing then I've got several EMU
patches<00:02:16.520> these<00:02:16.730> are<00:02:16.910> sounds<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.600> re<00:02:17.930> sampled

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
through my mu e 6400 so these are kind

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.000 
through my mu e 6400 so these are kind
of<00:02:21.680> good<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:21.970> drum<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> bass<00:02:23.240> dubstep<00:02:24.010> but

they're also really good when you filter
them<00:02:26.720> down<00:02:26.930> they<00:02:27.230> can<00:02:27.380> just<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.680> sub<00:02:27.950> bass

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160

sound and then I've got a couple of
interesting<00:03:33.480> guitar<00:03:34.140> process<00:03:35.010> sounds<00:03:35.550> also

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
interesting guitar process sounds also

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120 
interesting guitar process sounds also
there's<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> whole<00:03:36.870> section<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.380> guitar<00:03:37.800> pads

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
here these are some spectral processed

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:22.270 
here these are some spectral processed
strings<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.690> custom-built

and then some interesting stuff I've got

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.640 
and then some interesting stuff I've got
you<00:04:26.009> know<00:04:26.160> my<00:04:26.639> kits<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.210> my<00:04:27.419> oven<00:04:27.840> door<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.530> my

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you know my kits of my oven door so my

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.830 
you know my kits of my oven door so my
oven<00:04:28.979> door<00:04:29.190> my<00:04:29.430> apartment<00:04:29.970> makes<00:04:30.210> some<00:04:30.479> pretty

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
oven door my apartment makes some pretty

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.580 
oven door my apartment makes some pretty
gnarly<00:04:31.169> squeaking<00:04:31.860> sounds<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.880> I<00:04:32.910> ended<00:04:33.240> up

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
gnarly squeaking sounds so I ended up

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.879 
gnarly squeaking sounds so I ended up
recording<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:36.320> crossfade<00:04:37.320> looping<00:04:37.770> it

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
recording that and crossfade looping it

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.610 
recording that and crossfade looping it
spend<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.310> lot<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.490> time<00:04:38.610> editing<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.620> then

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
spend a lot of time editing it and then

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:54.590 
spend a lot of time editing it and then
I've<00:04:40.770> got<00:04:40.949> this<00:04:41.490> patch<00:04:41.759> from<00:04:42.030> it

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.990 

then<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.630> have<00:04:55.780> another<00:04:56.400> oven<00:04:57.400> squeak<00:04:57.730> Pat's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
then I have another oven squeak Pat's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:12.920 
then I have another oven squeak Pat's
based<00:04:58.390> on<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.660> same<00:04:58.870> recordings

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.630 

also<00:05:13.930> one<00:05:14.110> day<00:05:14.260> I<00:05:14.290> realized<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:15.070> my<00:05:15.220> electric

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
also one day I realized that my electric

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.880 
also one day I realized that my electric
toothbrush<00:05:16.120> was<00:05:16.420> perfectly<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.080> tune<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.860> I

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
toothbrush was perfectly in tune so I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.360 
toothbrush was perfectly in tune so I
sampled<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:18.640> I've<00:05:18.880> got<00:05:19.480> some<00:05:19.660> all<00:05:19.870> natural

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
sampled that I've got some all natural

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.740 
sampled that I've got some all natural
sophisticated<00:05:21.370> mouth<00:05:21.610> filtering<00:05:22.240> happening
