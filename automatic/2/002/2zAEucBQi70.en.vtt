00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.180 

okay<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.230> on<00:00:01.829> my<00:00:02.120> Becket<00:00:03.120> burner

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay this is a video on my Becket burner

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.390 
okay this is a video on my Becket burner
heat<00:00:05.190> manager<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.180> did<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> video<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.980> year

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
heat manager I did a video like a year

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879 
heat manager I did a video like a year
ago<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.150> didn't<00:00:09.420> explain<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> whole<00:00:10.170> lot<00:00:10.590> as

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
ago and I didn't explain a whole lot as

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.459 
ago and I didn't explain a whole lot as
to<00:00:11.160> how<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.550> works

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
to how it works

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.150 
to how it works
so<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.769> gonna<00:00:13.980> try<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.849> now<00:00:16.160> all

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
so I'm gonna try to do that now all

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.970 
so I'm gonna try to do that now all
right<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:21.050> thermostat<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
right this is the thermostat for the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.279 
right this is the thermostat for the
boiler<00:00:23.490> inside<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:27.180> believe<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.080> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
boiler inside here and I believe it is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.940 
boiler inside here and I believe it is
set<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.890> 180<00:00:29.849> degrees

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.760 

there<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.670> no<00:00:33.880> low<00:00:34.180> limit<00:00:34.690> switch<00:00:35.200> on<00:00:35.500> this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
there is no low limit switch on this

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.740 
there is no low limit switch on this
because<00:00:36.010> this<00:00:36.220> is<00:00:36.280> what's<00:00:36.640> called<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:37.090> cold

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
because this is what's called a cold

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.280 
because this is what's called a cold
start<00:00:38.260> system

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.460 

and<00:00:43.470> right<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:44.730> since<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.510> started<00:00:46.050> as

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
and right now since it just started as

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.530 
and right now since it just started as
you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> says<00:00:47.550> burner<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.480> Ebola<00:00:49.220> and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
you can see it says burner and Ebola and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.240 
you can see it says burner and Ebola and
you<00:00:51.540> can<00:00:51.720> see<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> temperature<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you can see the temperature of the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
you can see the temperature of the
boiler<00:00:54.800> going<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:56.900> so<00:00:57.900> once<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.440> reaches<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
boiler going up so once that reaches a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.670 
boiler going up so once that reaches a
hundred<00:00:59.580> and<00:00:59.760> eighty<00:00:59.850> degrees<00:01:00.390> that'll<00:01:01.320> stop

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
hundred and eighty degrees that'll stop

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
hundred and eighty degrees that'll stop
the<00:01:02.070> burner<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:03.089> running<00:01:03.540> as<00:01:03.839> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.229> hear

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the burner from running as you can hear

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.260 
the burner from running as you can hear
and<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:08.509> run<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:11.100> circulator<00:01:11.759> will<00:01:12.060> keep

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and it will run the circulator will keep

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.800 
and it will run the circulator will keep
going<00:01:12.540> until<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.440> reaches<00:01:13.920> its<00:01:14.360> low<00:01:15.360> limit

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going until it reaches its low limit

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.310 
going until it reaches its low limit
threshold<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.970> then<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.210> guy<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.810> will

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
threshold and then this guy up here will

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.279 
threshold and then this guy up here will
step<00:01:19.649> in<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.780> economizing<00:01:21.780> light<00:01:21.990> will

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
step in and the economizing light will

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.609 
step in and the economizing light will
come<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:23.640> depending<00:01:24.300> on<00:01:24.450> demand<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:28.050> will

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
come on now depending on demand it will

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.400 
come on now depending on demand it will
depend<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.399> how<00:01:29.820> low<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.570> temperature<00:01:30.600> will

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
depend on how low the temperature will

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.180 
depend on how low the temperature will
get<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.580> boiler<00:01:33.119> I've<00:01:34.020> seen<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.590> sometimes

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
get on the boiler I've seen it sometimes

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.310 
get on the boiler I've seen it sometimes
go<00:01:35.550> as<00:01:35.729> low<00:01:35.940> as<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.149> hundred<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.690> thirty<00:01:37.020> five

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
go as low as a hundred and thirty five

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
go as low as a hundred and thirty five
degrees<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.700> usually<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.210> any

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
degrees but it doesn't usually go any

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.779 
degrees but it doesn't usually go any
lower<00:01:39.690> than<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:41.100> there's<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.429> lot<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
lower than that if there's a lot of

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.440 
lower than that if there's a lot of
demand

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
demand

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
demand
it<00:01:42.960> won't<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.820> probably<00:01:44.820> any<00:01:44.970> lower<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:46.340> 145

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it won't go probably any lower than 145

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.960 
it won't go probably any lower than 145
or<00:01:47.750> 150<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.410> again<00:01:49.679> it<00:01:49.800> depends<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.550> how<00:01:50.910> many

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
or 150 but again it depends on how many

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.839 
or 150 but again it depends on how many
times<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.810> been<00:01:51.899> running<00:01:52.349> it<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:53.280> looks<00:01:53.640> at

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
times it's been running it it looks at

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.710 
times it's been running it it looks at
all<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.300> factors<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.349> then<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.690> tries<00:01:57.690> to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
all these factors and then it tries to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.100 
all these factors and then it tries to
figure<00:01:58.050> out<00:01:58.410> how<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.709> save<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.429> most

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.690 

I<00:02:02.200> like<00:02:03.010> it<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.050> probably<00:02:05.320> saved<00:02:05.980> at

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
I like it I think I probably saved at

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700 
I like it I think I probably saved at
least<00:02:07.030> 20<00:02:07.560> 22<00:02:08.560> 25<00:02:09.130> gallons<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.940> year<00:02:10.410> yeah<00:02:11.410> that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
least 20 22 25 gallons a year yeah that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.610 
least 20 22 25 gallons a year yeah that
doesn't<00:02:11.920> sound<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:12.640> much<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.390> at<00:02:13.540> almost<00:02:13.720> $4

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
doesn't sound like much but at almost $4

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.180 
doesn't sound like much but at almost $4
a<00:02:14.650> gallon<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.400> adds<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.940> over<00:02:16.120> time<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.770> I've

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
a gallon it adds up over time so I've

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.770 
a gallon it adds up over time so I've
really<00:02:18.430> been<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:19.420> happy<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> unit

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
really been really happy with this unit

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.520 
really been really happy with this unit
works<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:23.710> well<00:02:25.830> after<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:27.340> shuts<00:02:27.640> off<00:02:27.880> and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
works very well after it shuts off and

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.280 
works very well after it shuts off and
it's<00:02:29.530> no<00:02:29.680> longer<00:02:30.130> needed<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.780> cool<00:02:32.260> down

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
it's no longer needed this can cool down

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.449 
it's no longer needed this can cool down
all<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> way<00:02:33.160> till<00:02:33.490> it's<00:02:33.970> stone-cold<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
all the way till it's stone-cold and

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.530 
all the way till it's stone-cold and
when<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.610> reaches<00:02:37.060> its<00:02:37.240> 135<00:02:38.230> low<00:02:38.650> threshold

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
when it reaches its 135 low threshold

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
when it reaches its 135 low threshold
you'll<00:02:40.540> see<00:02:40.810> this'll<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.380> into<00:02:41.680> standby<00:02:41.950> mode

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
you'll see this'll go into standby mode

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.660 
you'll see this'll go into standby mode
and<00:02:43.270> it'll<00:02:43.750> say<00:02:43.959> burner<00:02:44.320> enabled<00:02:45.130> until<00:02:45.520> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and it'll say burner enabled until the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.270 
and it'll say burner enabled until the
next<00:02:45.850> time<00:02:46.180> that's<00:02:46.450> needed<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.739> it's<00:02:47.950> kind<00:02:48.190> of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
next time that's needed so it's kind of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.810 
next time that's needed so it's kind of
cool<00:02:48.489> how<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.820> works<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:50.380> can<00:02:50.410> also<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
cool how it works you can also do a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.630 
cool how it works you can also do a
search<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.540> internet<00:02:52.770> for<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:53.950> item<00:02:54.250> and

there's a there's a video on there that

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.830 
there's a there's a video on there that
tells<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.630> all<00:02:58.690> about<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.560> what<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.890> does

tells you all about it and what it does
the<00:03:01.840> other<00:03:02.020> good<00:03:02.380> thing<00:03:02.709> about<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:04.530> for

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the other good thing about this is for

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.130 
the other good thing about this is for
systems<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.880> one<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.720> well

McLean gold that's really efficient and
you<00:03:11.620> only<00:03:11.799> get<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.070> stack<00:03:12.430> temperature<00:03:13.239> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
you only get a stack temperature of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.039 
you only get a stack temperature of
about<00:03:14.310> 300<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.660> 320<00:03:16.660> or<00:03:16.980> 350<00:03:17.980> degrees<00:03:19.049> this

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
about 300 to 320 or 350 degrees this

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.490 
about 300 to 320 or 350 degrees this
makes<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.709> burner<00:03:20.980> run<00:03:21.549> longer<00:03:21.940> cycles<00:03:22.780> which

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
makes the burner run longer cycles which

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.330 
makes the burner run longer cycles which
in<00:03:23.709> turns<00:03:24.090> heats<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.360> pipe<00:03:25.630> up<00:03:25.930> higher<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
in turns heats the pipe up higher and it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.380 
in turns heats the pipe up higher and it
dries<00:03:27.700> out<00:03:28.030> your<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:29.709> chimney

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390

unfortunately<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.690> me<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.260> got<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.830> lot<00:03:33.010> of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
unfortunately for me I got a lot of

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.270 
unfortunately for me I got a lot of
moisture<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:33.940> chimney<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.440> froze<00:03:35.799> and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
moisture in the chimney and it froze and

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.910 
moisture in the chimney and it froze and
the<00:03:37.180> bricks<00:03:37.450> pop<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.380> had<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.709> put<00:03:38.890> a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
the bricks pop so I had to put a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.030 
the bricks pop so I had to put a
stainless<00:03:39.280> steel<00:03:39.790> liner<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.570> this<00:03:40.860> pain<00:03:41.860> in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
stainless steel liner in this pain in

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
stainless steel liner in this pain in
the<00:03:42.160> neck<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:44.730> this<00:03:45.730> will<00:03:46.769> hopefully<00:03:48.060> stop

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
the neck so this will hopefully stop

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.250 
the neck so this will hopefully stop
that<00:03:49.390> from<00:03:49.630> happening<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.799> can<00:03:50.980> see<00:03:51.220> where

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
that from happening you can see where

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.369 
that from happening you can see where
getting<00:03:52.650> hotter<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.220> hotter<00:03:53.489> here<00:03:54.379> we're

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
getting hotter and hotter here we're

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.050 
getting hotter and hotter here we're
almost<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.099> point<00:03:56.370> where<00:03:56.519> it's<00:03:56.760> going<00:03:56.909> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
almost to the point where it's going to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.960 
almost to the point where it's going to
shut<00:03:57.299> off

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.970 

and<00:04:00.240> let's<00:04:00.750> take<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.020> look<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> actual

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and let's take a look at the actual

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.850 
and let's take a look at the actual
burner<00:04:02.400> itself<00:04:03.030> while<00:04:03.420> we're<00:04:03.600> waiting<00:04:04.050> this

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
burner itself while we're waiting this

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.640 
burner itself while we're waiting this
is<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> becket<00:04:05.580> burner<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:06.600> was<00:04:06.870> installed<00:04:07.200> in

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
is a becket burner this was installed in

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.720 
is a becket burner this was installed in
2000<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.330> still<00:04:09.630> has<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.110> big<00:04:10.350> motor<00:04:10.730> over

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
2000 so it still has the big motor over

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.120 
2000 so it still has the big motor over
here<00:04:12.000> newer<00:04:12.270> models<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.470> little<00:04:13.830> tiny

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
here newer models have a little tiny

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.039 
here newer models have a little tiny
motor<00:04:14.550> on<00:04:14.940> them<00:04:15.150> they<00:04:15.300> look<00:04:15.510> kind<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.840> goofy

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
motor on them they look kind of goofy

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.810 
motor on them they look kind of goofy
looking<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.299> course<00:04:18.570> that's<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
looking and of course that's the the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.040 
looking and of course that's the the
ignition<00:04:21.330> coil<00:04:22.100> right<00:04:23.100> there<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:24.050> your

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
ignition coil right there and your

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.330 
ignition coil right there and your
control<00:04:25.470> box

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.230 

pretty<00:04:31.000> quiet<00:04:31.330> actually<00:04:32.580> I'll<00:04:33.580> zoom<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.120> a

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
pretty quiet actually I'll zoom in a

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.930 
pretty quiet actually I'll zoom in a
little<00:04:34.360> closer<00:04:34.720> on<00:04:35.230> this

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.360 

so<00:04:39.420> if<00:04:39.540> anybody's<00:04:40.020> interested<00:04:40.830> they<00:04:40.980> can<00:04:41.010> look

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
so if anybody's interested they can look

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.040 
so if anybody's interested they can look
at<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.700> as<00:04:41.940> well

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.500 

calling<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:46.070> heat<00:04:46.250> now<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.850> it's<00:04:47.000> under<00:04:47.300> quite

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
calling for heat now so it's under quite

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.790 
calling for heat now so it's under quite
a<00:04:47.570> bit<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.840> load

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:04.590 

we're<00:04:52.310> almost<00:04:52.460> up<00:04:52.849> the<00:04:53.060> temp

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.710 

okay<00:05:05.600> it<00:05:05.780> just<00:05:06.050> called<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.590> heard<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.950> click

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
okay it just called I heard it click

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.940 
okay it just called I heard it click
okay<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.140> goes<00:05:09.380> into<00:05:09.620> standby<00:05:09.920> mode<00:05:10.610> now
