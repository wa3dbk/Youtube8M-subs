00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello at apple tutorials in this 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.840
 tutorial from the series mac for beginners 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.900
 i want the launchpad un mission 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.129
 to introduce control under mac os 10 if 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.260
 you know windows then they are 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.359
 used to open programs start menu 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.080
 to use at least in the old windows 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.029
 versions 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.100
 It 's a bit different with apple 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.260
 but to understand very quickly 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.340
 Let's start with that 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.109
 launchpad when you start your mac 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.879
 then you will see the dock in here below 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.760
 you can already find a dock at the dock 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.699
 series of their programs but only the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.249
 which are firmly anchored in the dok if I 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.709
 now all my programs in the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.749
 wants to look over overview then uses 

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.239
 for that the launchpad achieves that 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.929
 I either im here about this symbol 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.299
 dock or I just go to the 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.190
 function key 4 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.289
 yes, if you already have an iphone 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.690
 or ipad are familiar then comes to them 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.309
 the kind of presentation here maybe 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.869
 already a bit familiar before in the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.049
 launchpad will be all programs completely 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.600
 Similar to ios in the form of are 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.109
 symbols are shown and if I am now 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.719
 So then here about now simply a me 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.590
 I want to open the program I click it 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.500
 simply at 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.179
 it will open the launchpad 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.030
 disappears and I can do it right away 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.609
 right here with my program work 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.049
 around that the programs then again 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.640
 to display new ones 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.009
 I go back to the launchpad 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.560
 over the dock or over the four button 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.899
 I can navigate in the launchpad 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.649
 that just with swipe gestures on the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.450
 make trackpad or see below 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.659
 you can talk about these little circles 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.230
 So I write down in the launchpad here 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.570
 navi 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.660
 her if I did not pick something up 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.610
 I can find the search box up here 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.350
 For example, I just use it 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.970
 my calculator is not because i prefer the forest 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.230
 I can not see all the trees 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.930
 Just here are the first letters of the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.030
 program and then I will 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.790
 right here already the result here 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 indicated by default are the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.890
 symbols in the launchpad alphabetically 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.980
 I can sort it easily 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.320
 change here i want the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.090
 have shown mail app at the very front 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.300
 I drag the symbol with drag &amp; drop 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.330
 simply to the desired location and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.250
 If I am at a later date 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.790
 then the country locks again opens 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.180
 So these attitudes are remembered 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.640
 away yes what else is there to the launch pad 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.500
 to say just when I have many programs 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.050
 have installed and some of them 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 maybe thematically belong together 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.200
 then i could look into my apps too 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.400
 sort categories or sort by the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.490
 I show now just I 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 Below are three programs namely pages 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.170
 numbers and keynote are all three 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 out of the box suite and that's what I want 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.709
 Now I simply create a folder 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.700
 how do i do that i just pull 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.310
 one of the symbols on another symbol 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.620
 then exactly what happens now 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.440
 Here I just see then click here 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.970
 again on the free area and the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 So I want keynote that too 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.600
 I also want to be part of the work 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.580
 sort it here 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.410
 i just draw the symbols 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.450
 and then have them here 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.310
 sorted by subject then I can here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.959
 this folder also a frame 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 In that case, of course, would give 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.860
 I just go wonderfully fit 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.920
 Just click the enter button and have me 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.160
 here with a folder for my three 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.100
 Applications created when I have one 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.050
 then would like to remove folder later 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.360
 I do not need to delete it extra 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.340
 but I just draw the symbols 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.590
 here from the bar just again 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.930
 out and as soon as less than 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.879
 two symbols in one 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.730
 it is he also dissolves 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.739
 automatically so I So do it 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.609
 does not have to delete but takes off 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.010
 simply by itself yes to the launchpad 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.170
 I go either in the dock to close 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.540
 here again on the symbol or I go 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.049
 on the function key 4 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.229
 so that was it for the launch pad now 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.329
 a few words apologize to mission 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.280
 control what is that? 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.800
 This is especially for those 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.800
 interesting with many programs 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.660
 at the same time working on her mac so 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.060
 I have this for example here 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.860
 safari browser open then I have 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.470
 here in pages document then i have 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.940
 a numbers file i have the fine one 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.070
 then open and I have the 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.900
 Card app will be very fast though 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.330
 Somehow a bit confusing around me 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.729
 Then overview is to provide 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.160
 mission control very helpful for that 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.889
 I just have to go to the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.050
 Press function key f3 and then see 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.010
 me all my open applications 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.349
 here on the desk as a miniature 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.349
 so I see aha I have the 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:07.720
 cards open pages numbers den 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.539
 safari browser my fender is still too 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.070
 there and if I start now to 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.289
 example my pages file i 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.370
 did not need to find then 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.139
 I just need here to 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.870
 Click and the application will then 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:25.330
 automatically brought forward so the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.340
 function key f3 yes with the can 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.620
 I just about mission control mia in 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.620
 miniatures of my open applications 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.360
 just here so in the form can be displayed 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.680
 yes, that was it already 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.349
 who wants to read the whole thing again 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.720
 as always I have the whole thing 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.090
 sometimes in writing on apple tutorials 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.370
 de publishes the link to this i have 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.680
 then inserted under the video 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.430
 I just wish a lot of fun 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.380
 imitate 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.580
 Thanks for watching and 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.580
 hopefully until next time
