00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.490
 to 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.890
 hello all youtube friends I'm raul 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.939
 x pro and good come on today we go with a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 tutorial and the tutorial is that 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.600
 for example here a very common fault in 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.949
 good windows is rare but usually 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 occur in windows xp service pack 3 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.629
 especially if he is a pirate 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.280
 I do this because he has asked me for a sub 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.770
 and well finally let's start 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.739
 the fault is that here we have a 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.930
 file of the same format mine is point 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.079
 hard and at the time of changing the name 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 we put that I know 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 I do not know 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.040
 thing 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.950
 and we get this and if we give that if 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.980
 the file is disabled and if 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.550
 we give that no, we can not change 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.370
 name 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.830
 and then this 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.860
 to start it serves for all 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.740
 windows this solution but I'm going to 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 do in windows xp service pack 3 good 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.289
 to start we're going to start my pc 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.900
 then we go to tools we give 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.810
 to folder options we're going to see 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.750
 we go down 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.130
 and here that puts 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.540
 hide do not hide extension extensions 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 for files for known files 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.850
 because this option is demarcated 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.850
 we mark we give to apply 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.070
 then we give it to accept 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.399
 we can close this already 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 of it here if we want to change the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.860
 first name 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.319
 and put 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.909
 things to call it that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.409
 we see how the file is already changed 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:29.310
 this is a very light tutorial or very 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:34.349
 very short fast 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.480
 that he gave me his private message and that 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.569
 is looking and I say 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.780
 and look for google but I have entered I have 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.069
 seen that nobody 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.440
 there was no one to explain it or was 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.790
 poorly explained so I've decided 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.370
 do it myself so daschle like 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.590
 subscribe to comment and if you have 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.930
 any failure that I doubt very much 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.569
 leave it to me in the comments if I 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.569
 I will respond, goodbye, goodbye
