00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
hey guys it's Samir from lacrosse

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey guys it's Samir from lacrosse
Network<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.680> today<00:00:07.980> we're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> be

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
Network and today we're going to be

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.360 
Network and today we're going to be
going<00:00:08.639> over<00:00:08.849> how<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> pass<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.749> lacrosse<00:00:10.019> ball

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
going over how to pass a lacrosse ball

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.319 
going over how to pass a lacrosse ball
so<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.459> first<00:00:11.669> thing<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.119> talk

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:12.329 
so the first thing we're going to talk

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.480 
so the first thing we're going to talk
about<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> mechanics<00:00:13.409> of<00:00:13.499> passing<00:00:13.919> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
about is the mechanics of passing the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.680 
about is the mechanics of passing the
mechanics<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.030> passing<00:00:15.329> the<00:00:15.389> lacrosse<00:00:15.659> ball

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
mechanics of passing the lacrosse ball

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
mechanics of passing the lacrosse ball
are<00:00:16.110> very<00:00:16.560> similar<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.490> passing<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.970> football

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
are very similar to passing a football

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.840 
are very similar to passing a football
or<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.660> baseball<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:20.130> we're<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.370> start<00:00:20.670> by

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
or a baseball so we're going to start by

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.570 
or a baseball so we're going to start by
getting<00:00:21.110> perpendicular<00:00:22.110> to<00:00:22.200> our<00:00:22.350> target<00:00:22.590> just

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
getting perpendicular to our target just

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.520 
getting perpendicular to our target just
like<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.030> throw<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.270> football<00:00:24.510> or<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
like you would throw a football or a

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.710 
like you would throw a football or a
baseball<00:00:25.890> we're<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.700> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> square<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
baseball we're not going to square up to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
baseball we're not going to square up to
our<00:00:27.810> target<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.230> lacrosse<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.860> square<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
our target in lacrosse we square up we

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
our target in lacrosse we square up we
can't<00:00:30.030> get<00:00:30.180> any<00:00:30.360> power<00:00:30.860> so<00:00:31.860> we're<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> be

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
can't get any power so we're going to be

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
can't get any power so we're going to be
perpendicular<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.000> our<00:00:33.180> target<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
perpendicular to our target and the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.750 
perpendicular to our target and the
first<00:00:34.710> step<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.220> take<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.610> with

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
first step we're going to take is with

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
first step we're going to take is with
our<00:00:35.850> front<00:00:36.120> foot<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> point

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
our front foot and we're going to point

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.890 
our front foot and we're going to point
it<00:00:37.650> at<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:38.010> target<00:00:38.390> when<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
it at our target when we do that that

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.680 
it at our target when we do that that
allows<00:00:40.530> us<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.980> open<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.460> our<00:00:41.610> hips<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.000> fully

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
allows us to open up our hips and fully

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.210 
allows us to open up our hips and fully
turn<00:00:43.020> them<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.620> much<00:00:43.739> power<00:00:43.980> as

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
turn them and get as much power as

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.970 
turn them and get as much power as
possible<00:00:44.450> towards<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.570> target<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.680> last

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
possible towards our target the last

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
possible towards our target the last
thing<00:00:47.220> that's<00:00:47.310> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> come<00:00:47.760> through<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
thing that's going to come through is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
thing that's going to come through is
your<00:00:48.780> hand<00:00:48.989> okay

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
your hand okay

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
your hand okay
so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> top<00:00:50.880> hand<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.450> come<00:00:51.510> through

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so the top hand is going to come through

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.060 
so the top hand is going to come through
just<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> were<00:00:52.559> throwing<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.920> football

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
just like you were throwing a football

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
just like you were throwing a football
you're<00:00:53.790> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.970> follow<00:00:54.210> through<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.780> your

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you're going to follow through with your

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
you're going to follow through with your
hand<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.770> shoulder<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.940> back

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
hand and your shoulder your back

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.850 
hand and your shoulder your back
shoulder<00:00:57.660> dictates<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> ball<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
shoulder dictates where the ball is

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.709 
shoulder dictates where the ball is
going<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> finish<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.600> your

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
going to go so if you finish with your

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.870 
going to go so if you finish with your
back<00:01:00.899> shoulder<00:01:01.260> low<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:02.280> pass<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.700> going<00:01:02.790> to

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
back shoulder low your pass is going to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.850 
back shoulder low your pass is going to
go<00:01:03.000> low<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.079> finish<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.620> back

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
go low if you finish with your back

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
go low if you finish with your back
shoulder<00:01:05.220> high<00:01:05.370> your<00:01:06.000> pass<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> go

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shoulder high your pass is going to go

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
shoulder high your pass is going to go
high<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:07.890> we're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> pick<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
high now we're going to pick up a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.469 
high now we're going to pick up a
lacrosse<00:01:08.700> stick<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> how<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
lacrosse stick and see how that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.270 
lacrosse stick and see how that
translates<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.590> first<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
translates the first thing you want to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.320 
translates the first thing you want to
do<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> pick<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.030> lacrosse<00:01:12.299> stick

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
do when you pick up the lacrosse stick

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
do when you pick up the lacrosse stick
let's<00:01:12.840> figure<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.620> want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> put

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
let's figure out where you want to put

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
let's figure out where you want to put
your<00:01:14.100> top<00:01:14.250> hand<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.360> don't<00:01:15.690> want<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> too

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
your top hand now we don't want it too

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
your top hand now we don't want it too
high<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> stick<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.460> can't

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
high on the stick because then we can't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
high on the stick because then we can't
get<00:01:17.790> any<00:01:17.970> power<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.440> too<00:01:19.590> low

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
get any power we don't want it too low

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
get any power we don't want it too low
because<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.400> lose<00:01:20.610> control<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
because then we lose control of the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
because then we lose control of the
stick<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.260> way<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.380> figure<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.860> where<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
stick so the way to figure out where to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
stick so the way to figure out where to
put<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.610> top<00:01:23.760> hand<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> butt<00:01:25.440> end

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
put your top hand is to put the butt end

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.670 
put your top hand is to put the butt end
of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> stick<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.150> elbow<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:27.690> see

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of the stick right at your elbow and see

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
of the stick right at your elbow and see
where<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.280> hand<00:01:29.460> lies<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.330> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> lie

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
where your hand lies it's going to lie

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
where your hand lies it's going to lie
somewhere<00:01:31.080> in<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> middle<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> stick<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
somewhere in the middle of the stick and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
somewhere in the middle of the stick and
that's<00:01:32.580> where<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.850> top<00:01:33.000> hand<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.320> now

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that's where your top hand goes so now

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's where your top hand goes so now
we're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:34.920> through<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.670> same

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we're going to go through the same

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
we're going to go through the same
motions<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.510> we<00:01:36.630> did<00:01:36.780> without<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> stick

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
motions as we did without the stick

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.969 
motions as we did without the stick
we're<00:01:38.340> perpendicular<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> our<00:01:39.750> target<00:01:39.990> we're

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we're perpendicular to our target we're

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.500 
we're perpendicular to our target we're
going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> step<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.670> our<00:01:41.700> front<00:01:42.060> foot<00:01:42.330> and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
going to step with our front foot and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.230 
going to step with our front foot and
open<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.170> hips<00:01:43.409> get<00:01:44.130> our<00:01:44.340> power<00:01:44.610> from<00:01:45.000> our

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
open up our hips get our power from our

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.830 
open up our hips get our power from our
hips<00:01:45.420> pull<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:47.100> our<00:01:47.280> hand<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
hips pull through with our hand and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
hips pull through with our hand and
eventually<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.990> our<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.290> shoulder<00:01:49.740> now

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
eventually with our back shoulder now

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.740 
eventually with our back shoulder now
the<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.150> we<00:01:51.240> want<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> keep<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
make this motion much more fluid it's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510
