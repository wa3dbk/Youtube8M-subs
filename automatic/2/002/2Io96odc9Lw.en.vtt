kind of a fan of this rifle I like
shooting<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.080> rifle<00:00:22.260> more<00:00:22.529> than<00:00:22.650> an<00:00:22.740> ak-47

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
shooting this rifle more than an ak-47

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.009 
shooting this rifle more than an ak-47
the<00:00:23.760> reason<00:00:24.359> being<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:24.930> bit

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the reason being it's a little bit

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.660 
the reason being it's a little bit
smaller<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.619> bit<00:00:25.740> lighter<00:00:25.949> very<00:00:26.279> handy

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
smaller a little bit lighter very handy

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.800 
smaller a little bit lighter very handy
and<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> recoil<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.599> bit<00:00:27.689> more

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
and the recoil is a little bit more

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
and the recoil is a little bit more
manageable<00:00:28.160> overall<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> great

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
manageable overall I think it's a great

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
manageable overall I think it's a great
