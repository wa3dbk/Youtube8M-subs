 done 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.349
 as usual as usual 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.560
 I have an idea 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.419
 time that has been in my head for a while 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.420
 and I'm sad this excerpt from this ordeal in the good old 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 to be able to concretize in what it consists I had already spoken too much 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.830
 complicated 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.900
 if you are a regular of the owner two workers of the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.140
 competition actually it confiscated 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.740
 you asked questions about the wholesale fall game what I was told 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.620
 says yet remains the video 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.650
 ejected to the video 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.040
 revocation 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.159
 in fact it's you 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.600
 what to do 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.170
 pearl at balzac video according to the questions obviously according to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.859
 responses 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.110
 that I am amazed 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.060
 in relation to this question 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.700
 the concept of everything short 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.090
 so I confess I'm a little bit I'm not sure it's going to be 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 top 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.100
 I have big doubts 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 but hey that's what I wanted to do for a long time 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 to see him I think that four children once it's good I think that when we 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.610
 starts 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 why not repeat the questions 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.720
 but what can we tell you that I wanted to give free rein to 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 award winning works invitations I leave you carte blanche greece but 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
 it must be said that the issues related to the game 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 do not hesitate to ask specific questions about the game at tonight's game 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.870
 who surround the game off on how I felt compared to little else 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.070
 or on other things and not in anything but why not 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.870
 obvious about some excerpts from his boat holds that you have the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.109
 day I can not 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.529
 I think we all have an opinion either 13 and I think we all have questions 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.539
 parents absolutely right of all they are also at the end of the day 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.539
 either a rise that you and know some specific points 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.590
 help me I think it's my son's content and I know it's coming 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.350
 porchet 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.650
 I spent more than 70 hours and her spouse who is wearing video 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.669
 so the time I know just about everything 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.969
 so do not hesitate to meet in details about the issues 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.049
 the West are more global questions that will be discussed again. 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.089
 what do you want gold if there are too many questions of course I could 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.180
 not answer 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.669
 at any moment we'll see how it goes 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.669
 I think I'll take everything even second priority 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.049
 all in all those who participate a lot in the profile of those who put 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:33.590
 orders 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.999
 ferhat 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.229
 because they find 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.669
 a lot of people for once I read all the comments that prove 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:39.399
 at the level 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.649
 for all the back to force 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.209
 why I think I'll take a little have been only if you're 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.999
 a perfect stranger you may be able to ask your question about 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.199
 that question 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.219
 still terrifying weave an interesting question relevant 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.629
 with the network in a swarm I will answer anyway of course 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.769
 who can ride because of that 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.409
 so here you have understood the principle 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.459
 for questions you may have to write them down as a result of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.739
 this video the royer no private messages if you plead not me 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.740
 felt as well 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.230
 I get these messages like that in all trades please to the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 following this idea or not of the current notable period video 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.419
 we'll say 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.879
 maximum question per person so that it does not leave too much the mess for that 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.749
 I can defend 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.660
 a people action this post if free here 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.129
 if some of you 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.279
 ask me question 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.280
 you can imagine that it is not possible 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.759
 so it's up to answer but hey you know me 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:37.749
 e 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.040
 after we can with what he is me when I left in a trick he has 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.620
 made up by thirty minutes to answer a single fiery thing 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.039
 it's going to be difficult for the om 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.830
 but in the forest to ask you a question as a result 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.069
 in the comments of this video what I will do 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.719
 per person 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.699
 There you go 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.079
 I think we went around 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.919
 for the people you can also tell if this concept a lower to the 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.779
 following this video 10% and even if the alliance is difficult to pronounce 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.799
 as for her that the video has not been done yet this year it will take 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.409
 wait for the final verdict you saw the bellard video because we 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.769
 loved it like saying what you think 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.390
 for armed robberies also on the menu sort of things please 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.410
 effortlessly crisscross me send me private messages 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.860
 on the side of friend requests it's on the 360 ​​river and on the prescription 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.999
 three 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.119
 not that it bothers me particularly but that's what I 

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:33.409
 does not accept anyone and I do not answer this is a private message on the console 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.750
 it takes way too much time if it is that this keypad to the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.740
 joystick it's not possible patrick to write this sentence I was minutes 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.120
 so it's not possible 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.940
 we should not show that I'm not wearing any for konami so that's 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.210
 a mixed demand 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.349
 your child 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.430
 for the ps3 we should find its doors 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.490
 so leave to take a few people that I know but I 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.860
 prefer to take no one 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.969
 they protest against groups of friends 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.839
 on the other hand, between 3,360 and a few hours 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:04.029
 it's been years that I avoided for ipad against 100 for 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.439
 videos really do not make sense 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.159
 by the way estimated that we could 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.319
 I will soon be deleted when you do not take the lead 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.379
 normal I was advancing three goals on 38 08 on ps3 they are afraid he is like that 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:15.500

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.409
 rsa beneficiaries 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.879
 maybe maximum 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.009
 be to heal these people were asking questions that interest francs 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.400
 we're waiting for the answer might not be 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.790
 as many people as possible of course to ask them more questions 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.169
 personal I let you do it again 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.659
