done I got on the scale and weighed 249
which<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:26.150> little<00:02:27.150> higher<00:02:27.330> where<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.690> was

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
which is a little higher where it was

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.509 
which is a little higher where it was
when<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.319> plateau<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.980> six<00:02:29.220> months

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
when I was on my plateau for six months

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.699 
when I was on my plateau for six months
so<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.480> hard<00:02:30.870> work<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.260> washed<00:02:31.530> down

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
so all that hard work was washed down

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.780 
so all that hard work was washed down
the<00:02:31.739> drain<00:02:31.860> once<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.480> reset<00:02:33.900> at

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the drain once again and I was reset at

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.460 
the drain once again and I was reset at
like<00:02:35.790> 250<00:02:36.330> again<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:38.989> knew<00:02:39.989> right<00:02:40.019> then<00:02:40.440> that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
like 250 again so I knew right then that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
like 250 again so I knew right then that
something<00:02:41.040> had<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.280> change<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.880> mean<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.209> time

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
up which everybody's going to do the key

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.370 
up which everybody's going to do the key
is<00:03:41.700> not<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.940> let<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.329> get<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.569> down<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
bad as eating bad because it's going to

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.120 
bad as eating bad because it's going to
get<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.260> at<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> same<00:03:52.560> place<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.069> that's
