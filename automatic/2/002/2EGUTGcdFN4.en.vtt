00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.100 

hundred<00:00:46.410> palace<00:00:46.890> net<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.989> was

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
hundred palace net I think so it was

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.250 
hundred palace net I think so it was
from<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.489> credit<00:00:50.850> goes<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> their

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
from them so credit goes to their

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
from them so credit goes to their
website<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> their<00:00:53.610> developers<00:00:54.180> who<00:00:54.480> made<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
website and their developers who made it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.060 
website and their developers who made it
possible<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> game<00:00:56.719> I<00:00:58.070> don't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
possible so this is the game I don't

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.729 
possible so this is the game I don't
think<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.670> need<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.500> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
think you really need much on it you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
think you really need much on it you
know<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.579> chain<00:01:02.879> fire

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
know I don't think you need chain fire

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.130 
know I don't think you need chain fire
and<00:01:03.600> stuff<00:01:04.369> because<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> works<00:01:06.540> just

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and stuff because I think it works just

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
and stuff because I think it works just
fine<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> here's<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> game<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:12.150> might

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
fine so here's the game and it might

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.999 
fine so here's the game and it might
take<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:13.320> long<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.070> load<00:01:14.900> but<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.650> game<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
take a bit long to load but the game is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.780 
take a bit long to load but the game is
quite<00:01:17.520> ok<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> an<00:01:19.710> accelerometer<00:01:20.220> game

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
quite ok so it is an accelerometer game

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
quite ok so it is an accelerometer game
and<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.840> free<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> App<00:01:22.470> Store<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and it is free in the App Store but it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.609 
and it is free in the App Store but it
is<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.780> supported<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.200> galaxy<00:01:25.650> Y<00:01:26.479> so

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
is not supported for the galaxy Y so

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.609 
is not supported for the galaxy Y so
developers<00:01:28.619> had<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> port<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
developers had to port it so here it is

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.690 
developers had to port it so here it is
so<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> move<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> swear<00:01:34.079> around

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
so to move you have to swear around

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
so to move you have to swear around
again<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:37.110> link<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.409> the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
10 frames per second it's not really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.850
