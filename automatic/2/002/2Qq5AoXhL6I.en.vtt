00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.040
 the gospel in three minutes with mario 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.530
 First person jesus compares your 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660
 a vegetable is like a grain of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.719
 mustard that a man sowed in his 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.880
 vegetable garden it grew and became a tree 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 and the birds of the air made nests in their 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 If you want to understand if you want 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.119
 understand the Bible you should seek the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 answers in the Bible itself is what we 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 Let's do it here to understand the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.040
 meaning of the bird tree in their 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.230
 years 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 if you have learned that the seed of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 mustard transformed into a tree is a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 positive figure of the advance of the gospel 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.110
 in the world it is better to pass an eraser 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.180
 in this idea 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.520
 some add that the birds 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 aligned would be the religious leaders 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 installed in different branches of the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.149
 Christianity to promote growth 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.829
 of the church 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.500
 although such an explanation is so 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.030
 convenient and comfortable for them 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.399
 how many nests 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 they should be ashamed of applying 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.380
 to themselves a position that the Lord 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 himself rejected it he said 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.840
 the birds of the sky have their nests but the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 son of man has nowhere to rest. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.130
 lucas 9 58 head to start a foot of 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.970
 mustard grows up to one meter 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.280
 twenty would not call it a tree and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.509
 It is unlikely that you will pass us nests. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 in its branches 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 therefore Jesus is talking about a 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 mutation of an abnormal growth of the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.759
 kingdom on earth 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.579
 in the bible tree is a figure of the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.509
 humanity that has roots in the earth 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 in the sky 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.159
 in chapter 4 of his book the prophet 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 daniel compares great dream tree and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 Nebuchadnezzar to the king himself whose 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.470
 domains spread throughout the land 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.689
 but that tree would be overthrown because the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.840
 its abnormal growth did not come from 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.670
 god and man in the bible we 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.939
 we also find the meaning of the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 birds of the air in the parable of the sower 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.280
 Jesus says that birds that eat 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.340
 fallen seeds on the brink of chaos 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.250
 represents a satan apocalypse 18/2 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 says that Babylon has become a dwelling for 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.700
 demons and den of the whole spirit 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.990
 unclean of the whole impure way and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.180
 detestable 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.090
 You already know that Babylon is the future. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 Christianity is the one that should 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.770
 to present as the bride of Christ but 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.770
 surprised John as he appeared in the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.080
 vision he had as a whore 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.110
 therefore Jesus is saying that in the hands 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.100
 of men the kingdom would have a growth 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.050
 not normal 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 the history of Christianity shows that the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.040
 branches of this tree have always served to 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 align all the impure and obnoxious way 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 the tree is not a positive image of the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.800
 growth of the gospel and the future 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.740
 of the testimony of God on earth 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.990
 this would become an aberration in the hands 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.040
 of men and would house leaders of the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.070
 species 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 paulo calls the false apostle oaks 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.230
 deceived by pretending to be apostles of 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.320
 Christ and adds that the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.209
 satan disguises himself as an angel of light 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.330
 so it is no surprise that their 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.970
 servants pretend that they are servants of justice 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.900
 is on second Corinthians 11 of 14 to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.209
 15 and the fermented pasta well in the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.370
 three minutes you will see that you will have to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.530
 learned about it
