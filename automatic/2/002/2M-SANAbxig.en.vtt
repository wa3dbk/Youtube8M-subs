300 but I know it's at least 275 pounds
even<00:01:29.960> with<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.530> very<00:01:31.100> strong<00:01:31.490> helpers

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
even with two very strong helpers

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.170 
even with two very strong helpers
lifting<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.410> goal<00:01:33.620> up<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.910> somebody

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
lifting the goal up so that somebody

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.560 
lifting the goal up so that somebody
else<00:01:35.480> can<00:01:35.690> bolt<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.050> together<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.970> hazard

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
else can bolt it together is the hazard

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.320 
else can bolt it together is the hazard
because<00:01:38.780> somebody<00:01:39.380> could<00:01:39.590> slip<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.330> you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
because somebody could slip and you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.870 
because somebody could slip and you
would<00:01:41.540> drop<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.040> drop<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.160> backboard<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.790> it

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
would drop the drop the backboard and it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.630 
would drop the drop the backboard and it
could<00:01:44.030> injure<00:01:44.330> somebody<00:01:44.570> or<00:01:45.490> bust<00:01:46.490> the

could injure somebody or bust the
backboard<00:01:47.060> all<00:01:47.210> together<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:47.840> hope<00:01:48.080> for<00:01:48.350> next

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
backboard all together I hope for next

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.610 
backboard all together I hope for next
year<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.370> end<00:01:49.550> of<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.660> installation
