so<00:00:00.949> sensory<00:00:01.949> receptors<00:00:02.520> come<00:00:02.850> in<00:00:03.120> many

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
so sensory receptors come in many

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.150 
so sensory receptors come in many
different<00:00:03.929> flavors<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.589> there's<00:00:04.740> lots<00:00:04.980> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
different flavors and there's lots of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.010 
different flavors and there's lots of
ways<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.580> can<00:00:05.730> actually<00:00:05.879> classify<00:00:06.420> them

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
ways that we can actually classify them

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.980 
ways that we can actually classify them
I<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.370> image<00:00:08.610> because<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.599> gives<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I like this image because it gives you a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.209 
I like this image because it gives you a
visual<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:11.099> all<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.610> different<00:00:12.920> forms<00:00:13.920> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
visual for all the different forms of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.590 
visual for all the different forms of
receptors<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:16.289> know<00:00:16.970> my<00:00:17.970> favorite<00:00:18.390> part

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
receptors and we know my favorite part

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620 
receptors and we know my favorite part
about<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.930> visual<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.210> not

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
about this visual is that you have not

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.330 
about this visual is that you have not
only<00:00:23.060> nerves<00:00:24.260> like<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.949> actual

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
only nerves like this is an actual

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
only nerves like this is an actual
neuron<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> cell<00:00:27.300> body<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.170> can

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
neuron with a cell body in these you can

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.400 
neuron with a cell body in these you can
consider<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.340> dendrites

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
consider them like little dendrites

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
consider them like little dendrites
those<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.740> ends<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.780> sensitive

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
those are little ends that are sensitive

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
those are little ends that are sensitive
and<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.860> imagine<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and that you know you can imagine that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
and that you know you can imagine that
that's<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> case<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:37.200> wrap

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that's the case but we can also wrap

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100 
that's the case but we can also wrap
them<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.370> connective<00:00:39.329> tissue<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.870> end<00:00:39.989> up

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
them in connective tissue and end up

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
them in connective tissue and end up
with<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.649> awesome<00:00:41.280> thing<00:00:41.489> that's<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
with that awesome thing that's a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.440 
with that awesome thing that's a
pressure<00:00:42.180> receptor<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.040> can<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.450> connect

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
pressure receptor you can also connect

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.060 
pressure receptor you can also connect
these<00:00:46.460> afferent<00:00:47.460> neurons<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> sensory<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
these afferent neurons to a sensory like

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.100 
these afferent neurons to a sensory like
a<00:00:50.100> cell<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.360> cell<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.110> modified<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.280> pick<00:00:53.610> up

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
a cell the cell is modified to pick up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.529 
a cell the cell is modified to pick up
sensory<00:00:55.110> stimuli<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.360> have

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
sensory stimuli and you can just have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.240 
sensory stimuli and you can just have
this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.980> little

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this is the same thing just little

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.630 
this is the same thing just little
pieces<00:00:59.399> coming<00:01:00.059> off<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:01.010> neuron<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
pieces coming off of your neuron so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
pieces coming off of your neuron so
there's<00:01:02.879> lots<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.510> different<00:01:03.899> ways<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
there's lots of different ways that you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.410 
there's lots of different ways that you
can<00:01:05.540> create<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:07.760> opportunity<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:10.250> translate

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
can create an opportunity to translate

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.100 
can create an opportunity to translate
stimulus<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.560> action<00:01:13.920> potential<00:01:14.600> now<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
stimulus into an action potential now we

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.780 
stimulus into an action potential now we
can<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.909> categorize<00:01:17.909> our<00:01:18.540> receptors<00:01:19.200> by<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
can also categorize our receptors by the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.690 
can also categorize our receptors by the
kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.540> stimulus<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.500> pick<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.920> so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
kind of stimulus that they pick up so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580 
kind of stimulus that they pick up so
let's<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> list<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.140> possible

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
let's make a list of all the possible

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.969 
let's make a list of all the possible
types<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.869> sensory<00:01:27.869> receptors<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.799> can

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
types of sensory receptors that we can

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950 
types of sensory receptors that we can
come<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
come up with and then what I'm going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
come up with and then what I'm going to
tell<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> we're<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> go

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
tell you is that we're going to go

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.999 
tell you is that we're going to go
through<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> bunch<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> look<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:34.860> how

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
through a bunch of them and look at how

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.760 
through a bunch of them and look at how
they<00:01:35.220> specifically<00:01:35.880> function<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.590> can

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they specifically function so we can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
they specifically function so we can
have<00:01:38.009> Meccano<00:01:38.970> receptors<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:44.630> Meccano

that's<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.640> Meccano<00:02:19.970> receptor<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.020> that's<00:02:21.230> one

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
that's a Meccano receptor so that's one

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's a Meccano receptor so that's one

thermo receptors pick up temperature

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.010 
thermo receptors pick up temperature
changes<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:37.400> actually<00:02:37.820> have<00:02:38.240> more<00:02:39.790> cold
