00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.089
 new diego responds before starting 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 cali trick never take your camera like this 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.900
 with all the confidence in the world with a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.090
 hand held to the with two one in the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 objective and another in the body you will not want 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.470
 that the gear that holds objective and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 body leave mind be without bed before 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
 to start do not forget that it is very 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 easy to participate in this section 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.130
 send me your question through twitter 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.019
 and select Sundays and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 I answer if yours has not appeared 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.080
 check the previous answers 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.669
 because very probably already 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 resolved 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.309
 Jorge Core 07 asks what a difference 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 there is between the 1080p image quality 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.890
 1080p 50 and 1080p 60 then Jorge the 50th 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 the accompanying 60 in 1080p do 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 reference to frames per second 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.829
 who has that video in the case of 50 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.379
 it has 50 frames per second and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.289
 in the 60 because 60 if it does not accompany 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 no number to that 1080 we take for granted 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 that has 25 frames per second 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.719
 because it is the European standard for 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.550
 broadcast on television or at any 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 conventional video on the other hand yes 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.800
 you're in a cinema those 25 are reduced 1 the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.260
 standard 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.640
 It's usually 24 frames per second 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.920
 talking about youtube questions if you go 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.200
 to notice the difference as a man of 25 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.120
 frames per second to 50 is clear 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.990
 that you will notice if you see it in 50 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.390
 frames per second 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.010
 you will see a much more fluid video and 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 you are going to have another sensation in the eye not 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.240
 of much more fluency much more 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.400
 continuity in the case of jumping 50 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.530
 at 60 or 24 to 25 frames per second 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.360
 well, we can hardly tell the difference 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.700
 said youtube asks what degrees 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 you study or have studied and where 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.480
 well I studied a technical course of 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 lighting of shows in zaragoza 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.620
 although I told him online but he had good 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.870
 that go to do some practices and such and 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.340
 in madrid 'studied for two years a 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.200
 Top grade lighting letter 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.570
 has image treatment at fer 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 of l 97 questions I give the procedure 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.390
 of installation of the magic lander is the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.370
 same the other camera that in which 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 explain this for the 600 thanks 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.780
 crack well yes it is totally the same 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.610
 procedure for all cameras in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.770
 some take longer in some less time 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.900
 but the process is exactly the same 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.150
 lenis calderÃ³n question hello I say what 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.770
 you think the goal is the same 70 200 28 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.830
 is enabled compared to that of 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.400
 canon then look at me with julie marin or 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 fiction 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.760
 I say it is a luxury in which the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.620
 compares and explains the advantages and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.599
 disadvantages of each one of them so 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.920
 I leave you in the description box or by 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 here for some annotation so that you 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.430
 Take a look and Manuel Garcia asks 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.230
 could you tell me where to get music 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.060
 to put a video a thousand thanks 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.680
 Of course I'll recommend the two 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.930
 pages that I use to make music 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 background for my videos I use audio 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.790
 micro and epidemic are in those two 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.769
 pages has a library almost almost 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.180
 infinite music for all your videos 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.069
