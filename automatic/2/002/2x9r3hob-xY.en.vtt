00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.779
 DVD review with a new round movie 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.779
 news 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 zach braff known among others as 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 main actor from the series scrubs 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 or spam like garden state the last one 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400
 course or last the fantastic world 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.110
 oz has been asking for years 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.730
 because he finally returns to garden state 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.199
 that would make a movie of its own 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.449
 Long do also have a project on 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.100
 kickstarter sin crowdfunding manner 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.570
 finally started that's it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.010
 long completed times can be found 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.390
 already in the middle of production though 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.129
 So last week the topic 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.589
 I would like to have crowdfunding that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.790
 video by zach braff the art 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.410
 Application video about this project 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.790
 at this point put to heart because 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.010
 he explains how difficult it is 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.489
 in hollywood these days, it's been donated to hollywood 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.049
 Find 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.640
 they do not have the creative part 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.500
 do not want to talk about a film rain 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.330
 want to own the right to a card 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.860
 or preferably with the carsten 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.869
 codetermined the video looks very honest 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.489
 has also built some gags into it 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.840
 including fake 800 or jim 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.040
 to see parson and I think it is 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.380
 maybe a great sight for everyone 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 around the topic of crowdfunding 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 So you're generally interested in googles 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 simply very strong states already 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.729
 Do you want to watch the video? 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.439
 here very happy times as the hanger 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 by the way this news follow because I the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.530
 find a great topic and above all 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.299
 also shows that even the little man 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.120
 can participate in the big one 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 at the earliest this is a film business 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.270
 series me personally since 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 I'm with it for decades 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.600
 Of course not alone millions 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.920
 people on the globe become 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.909
 regularly from the yellow family 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 to chat 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.750
 the worse of course the fact 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.370
 that the original speakers with aging and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 thus it came to the death message of 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.360
 massive wallace the spokeswoman of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.010
 figure edgar krapp appell of the count 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 producer al jean simmons is already the 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.370
 suggest that figure because of that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 maybe leave the series 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.850
 is confirmed so now, however 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 will still take a while because sometimes 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.150
 a year ago has already produced 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.010
 nevertheless , it is always one 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.750
 sad thing if life is just like that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.159
 there is no such thing 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.110
 right time and also rarely the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.400
 right words for all simpsons fans 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.530
 probably also a shock 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.489
 nevertheless a sad message which I 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.000
 here in the place not withheld 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.739
 want 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.659
 Last week I first reported 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.310
 that 150 shades of gray a new one 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.720
 meanwhile, actor is looking for power 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.040
 the job jamie dornan because charlie hunnam 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.260
 played should probably also on 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.210
 script a little too much to have a say 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.290
 whatever the universe is now 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.480
 probably the first consequences 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.490
 start the turn to 50 shades of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.930
 Gray should probably be around 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.210
 delay one month 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
 fans of the series entourage are already waiting 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.080
 long after that the movie finally 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.360
 warner is already being produced for that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 given the green light but existed 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.110
 This Marco Vollberg himself says that 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.700
 a few people still a little bit too 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.930
 greedy are because of the film 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.790
 you want to be successful 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.320
 Several are doing exactly that to me now 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.420
 it does not take long to say that 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.400
 jeremy piven de gaulle plays in the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.660
 series is somehow one of these types 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.980
 on the other hand often gets 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.600
 reported would already have a fixed 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.459
 contract with us so far so exactly 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.170
 hubbard and who believes too little too 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.150
 earn with a possible movie 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.730
 So it remains a big question mark though 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.050
 I personally love the series and would 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.660
 I wish so much that we know about it 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.790
 finally a movie would be released soon 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.890
 big cinema start of the week is probably 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.090
 gate will be kingdom i have me 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.380
 insanely excited about the movie 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.760
 My expectations are still relaxed 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.650
 We did that in Germany 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 the film for a change once a week 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.160
 allowed to see before the us start 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.810
 but regardless of that, it's nice that 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.920
 You look at marvel in regular 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.750
 can leave distances and the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 germany premiere was huge here in 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.790
 Berlin 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 but you actually ask yourself something 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.269
 is the current state and volvo wants 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.920
 Note it with this second goal 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.390
 Part in any case that the second 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.950
 You are white after the avengers 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.600
 that captain america 2 is coming up 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.370
 The comic con in san diego this year 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.500
 probably already laid that avengers 2 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.360
 the title will be age of authors and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.580
 The rumors about a possible one calls 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 they are getting louder and louder 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.400
 Maybe it's a whole 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.019
 interesting thing then you would have been 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.600
 a new character and also in that 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.340
 You can also borrow the one from thor 2 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.049
 or see another new figure and 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.850
 also the one or the other mega star 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.799
 his whole lot of exciting stuff though 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.780
 you 're so into the crystal ball madl 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.480
 where the whole time will go 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.400
 what we are honest Christoph forest 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.930
 We all really like to see and 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.880
 nice that he's in kill the boss 2 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.769
 an asshole together with chris pine 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.120
 The boss you play will be the first part 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.620
 very funny again with the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.540
 partie including kevin spacey 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.190
 jamie foxx jennifer aniston and the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.209
 ask colin farrell again 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.010
 is one can continue on the continuation 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.960
 already happy because the cast is 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.190
 terrific and above all with christoph 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.470
 waltz you can not go wrong 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.449
 make nice that the on board with this 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.039
 is michael bailey 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.479
 is again really crack because 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.520
 currently he is in the middle of the 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.349
 shooting to transformers 4 the but 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.180
 partly from protection money blackmail 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.249
 be overshadowed as it may, it 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.779
 Now a new video surfaced the 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.180
 one sees as mark wahlberg and one 

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.069
 fictitious optimus prime speech 20 30 meters 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.210
 looked in the air and that completely 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.620
 interesting so seeber if you look 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.330
 watching this video, you can tell that too 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.129
 such a big hollywood production 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.189
 right on the turn has relatively new 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.229
 may look if this currently as 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.059
 social media monster felt on the move 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.169
 be round and the production of almost 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.879
 and furious 7 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.740
 he posted a lot on twitter 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.419
 instagram or on facebook below 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.069
 a whole lot of set pictures were last 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.539
 It also included a video of the first 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.949
 training sessions where he 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.449
 insanely surprised we have what 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.099
 his companions have it all 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.779
 and now has the first photo 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.249
 posted and how he was with jason 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.259
 statham be seen for who the 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.729
 the sixth part has become white 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.129
 as a villain or a supposed one 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.289
 villain in the seventh act since 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.149
 23 years is already rumored when 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.039
 it finally a new filming for 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:29.050
 bauble mortal kombat will go 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.939
 Reunion with sub zero and scorpion 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.529
 the original filming was yes 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.969
 somehow quite stressful at times 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.649
 somehow it has a little bit too 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.360
 get cult factor however that may be 

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:38.860
 this week has come out that the 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.899
 current director has jumped 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.060
 Tweeted that even after three years 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.439
 fight all the others now at the 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.879
 project involved quite a lot 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.379
 luck and a huge success will be the 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.430
 question is just why the now 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.209
 it is not so jumped 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.830
 really clear 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:52.569
 that means in any case 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.669
 wait longer for many who are on it 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.409
 have been happy that's three more 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.939
 to give avatar parts has been around 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.919
 a while known the question is only 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.449
 when will they be back in theaters? 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.370
 james cameron twentieth century fox 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.800
 kept covered for a long time but it 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.020
 was also called the first 2016 in 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.979
 the cinemas could expect the question 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.089
 only when actually begins 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.699
 shooting in an Australian 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:14.139
 Radio show should be sam worthington 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.749
 at least in part 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.069
 have to start october 2014 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.959
 wanted to turn that would be time 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.520
 technically fit into the frame 

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.959
 if that is really true then 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.969
 let's say that at least 

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:27.490
 the latest news about avatar 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.529
 for all fans and to the conclusion still 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.839
 a little older news around 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.149
 the titanic the australian mail the 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:35.649
 clive palmer has long said that 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:36.969
 he necessarily build the titanic after 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.860
 want him and said he also wants to 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.769
 the fall again film but a lot 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.979
 much better than the blockbuster with kate 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:46.779
 winslet and leonardo dicaprio by year 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.339
 1997 yes that's a right 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.079
 high goal which was quite as unsuccessful 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.360
 After all, it does not really matter if it does 

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:53.799
 everything just hot air and talk is 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.239
 at least he thinks 

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:56.949
 even there is a whole lot of 

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:58.449
 Hollywood stars and international 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.789
 they like to play on board 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.689
 and he would be too 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.549
 short gigs want whether this is a 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.169
 nostrils or not I do not know though 

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:07.360
 it maybe a little rounder 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.459

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.809
 this is the end of this hereby 

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:12.939

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.499
 little fun otherwise only remains 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.329
