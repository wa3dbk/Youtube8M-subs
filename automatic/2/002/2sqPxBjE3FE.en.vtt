00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
which is looks great without kind of a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.480 
which is looks great without kind of a
wind<00:01:45.450> flowing<00:01:45.780> effect<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.340> like

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
wind flowing effect which I really like

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.039 
wind flowing effect which I really like
it's<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.850> made<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.750> rubbery

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

it's all made of this kind of rubbery
plastic<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.189> guys<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> see<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
plastic as you guys can see so it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.639 
plastic as you guys can see so it
doesn't<00:01:51.240> hinder<00:01:51.420> articulation<00:01:52.140> too<00:01:52.320> much<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
doesn't hinder articulation too much it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.630 
doesn't hinder articulation too much it
can<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.040> moved<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> side<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
can be moved a little to the side and I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
can be moved a little to the side and I
also<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.270> how<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.540> kept<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
also really like how they kept the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
also really like how they kept the
concept<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.950> character<00:01:59.549> himself<00:01:59.880> with

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
concept of the character himself with

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
concept of the character himself with
the<00:02:00.420> large<00:02:00.630> hands<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> large<00:02:01.350> feet<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the large hands and the large feet it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.899 
the large hands and the large feet it
does<00:02:02.100> hinder<00:02:02.369> articulation<00:02:03.180> at

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
does hinder articulation at

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.260 
does hinder articulation at
wit<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.530> still<00:02:05.799> accurate<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.759> healthy

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
wit but it's still accurate to healthy

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.259 
wit but it's still accurate to healthy

hindered<00:02:37.450> by<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.690> stuff<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.170> tad<00:02:38.470> bit<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.340> he

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
hindered by the stuff a tad bit but he

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.490

really<00:03:12.819> really<00:03:13.090> nicely<00:03:13.269> done<00:03:13.569> I'm<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.260> feet

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
really really nicely done I'm the feet

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.069 
really really nicely done I'm the feet
articulation<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:15.579> rotate<00:03:15.790> up<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.660> can

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
articulation it can rotate up and it can

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.289 
articulation it can rotate up and it can
tilt<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.190> there<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.090> course

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
tilt to is there but it is of course

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.390 
tilt to is there but it is of course
limited<00:03:19.480> by<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.139> bulkiness<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.709> his<00:03:21.099> shoes

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
limited by the bulkiness of his shoes

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.080 
limited by the bulkiness of his shoes
which<00:03:21.639> is<00:03:21.940> unfortunate<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.799> course<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.760> wings

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
which is unfortunate of course the wings

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.319 
which is unfortunate of course the wings
have<00:03:25.389> articulation<00:03:26.139> as<00:03:26.319> well<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:27.489> can<00:03:27.700> move

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
have articulation as well so we can move

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.569 
have articulation as well so we can move
them<00:03:28.510> up<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.989> down<00:03:29.620> they<00:03:30.010> are<00:03:30.190> molded

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
them up and down they are molded

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.490 
them up and down they are molded
differently<00:03:31.359> so<00:03:31.510> they're<00:03:31.660> not<00:03:31.840> identical<00:03:32.290> so

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
differently so they're not identical so

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.620 
differently so they're not identical so
this<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:32.859> kind<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.130> curves<00:03:33.340> slightly<00:03:33.760> front

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
this one kind of curves slightly front

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.379 
this one kind of curves slightly front
and<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.019> one<00:03:35.230> slightly<00:03:35.530> back<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:36.609> have<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
and this one slightly back we have the

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.780 
and this one slightly back we have the
movement<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.380> mid<00:03:38.590> wing<00:03:38.859> so<00:03:39.190> we<00:03:39.340> have<00:03:39.489> you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
movement in the mid wing so we have you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.680 
movement in the mid wing so we have you
can<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:40.180> back<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.620> go

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
can go back it can go

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.630 
can go back it can go
fronts<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.770> of<00:03:43.830> course<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.190> do<00:03:44.430> all

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
fronts so of course you can do all

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.090 
fronts so of course you can do all
different<00:03:44.880> kind<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.350> poses<00:03:46.350> with<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.890> winds

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
different kind of poses with the winds

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.220 
different kind of poses with the winds
since<00:03:47.700> they<00:03:47.850> have<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.120> much<00:03:48.240> articulation<00:03:48.660> as

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
since they have so much articulation as

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.500 
since they have so much articulation as
well<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.400> ice<00:03:50.490> comparison<00:03:50.970> why<00:03:51.060> since<00:03:51.300> there's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
well so ice comparison why since there's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.820 
well so ice comparison why since there's
about<00:03:51.630> four<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.050> half<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.560> do<00:03:52.710> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
about four and a half you just do the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.710 
about four and a half you just do the
top<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.100> his<00:03:53.220> head<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.850> course<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.270> he's<00:03:54.480> winds

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
top of his head of course so he's winds

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.270 
top of his head of course so he's winds
can<00:03:54.960> be<00:03:55.110> move<00:03:55.260> up<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.560> down<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:56.010> height

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
can be move up and down so that height

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.560 
can be move up and down so that height

grabbing<00:06:26.979> hands<00:06:27.190> are<00:06:27.789> really<00:06:28.330> really<00:06:28.630> tight

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
grabbing hands are really really tight

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.210 
grabbing hands are really really tight
so<00:06:29.110> it's<00:06:29.229> really<00:06:29.349> hard<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.680> get<00:06:29.770> that<00:06:29.919> little

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
so it's really hard to get that little

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.309 
so it's really hard to get that little
rod<00:06:30.430> in<00:06:30.729> and<00:06:31.090> out<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:31.659> you<00:06:31.690> do<00:06:31.930> have<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.169> use<00:06:32.289> a

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
rod in and out so you do have to use a

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.290 
rod in and out so you do have to use a
little<00:06:32.590> force<00:06:32.680> I<00:06:32.919> guess<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:33.669> will<00:06:33.880> loosen<00:06:34.120> up

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
little force I guess you will loosen up

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.870 
little force I guess you will loosen up
while<00:06:35.080> you<00:06:35.349> do<00:06:35.469> it<00:06:35.500> all<00:06:35.800> if<00:06:36.130> you<00:06:36.219> keep<00:06:36.430> on<00:06:36.639> doing
