00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.650
 Today again a tested video and 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.990
 Today is about these two products 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.300
 Act as I give you these two products 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 have shown in one of my house 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
 I wondered if I did not 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 can test these products 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.020
 and I got her more because of me 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.720
 flew the vacation and wanted you 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.090
 Now my opinion on these products 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.970
 say yes tell me how i do this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.820
 found or find products 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.189
 and yes we start directly to man and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.579
 while bally's professionally 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.430
 these are two in a shampoo and a wash 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 Rinses a very green with UV protection 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.700
 preserves the natural moisture of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.879
 Hairdressers recommended sunburned 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 hair and yes that should be so while in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.710
 be one when he is on vacation or 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 when you go swimming 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 We all know that through more salt 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.399
 the hair is dried out by the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.940
 Sunshine years too 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.430
 be strained and shampoo yes should 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.230
 stop and I have the whole thing 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.030
 I was 14 days on vacation and used 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.110
 So you see I have more than that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 half of it used 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 I was already media normally 1 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 until at most twice a week but in the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.560
 holiday by the swim and the heat 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.009
 and so I have mine in the 14 days 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 Hair washed and ten times 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.759
 you only tell it to smell it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 smells like 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.250
 So I do not know if you know that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 but if you ever on vacation 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.020
 have been and massage you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
 to let 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 it smells exactly like these massage oils 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.380
 So I do not know what's in it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.490
 It is not very pleasant 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.619
 very pleasant really really pleasant 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.869
 intense goggles with coconut oil 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.729
 not a bit now, or it is 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.500
 Cocos and me smell a bit 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 I really liked the smell 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 not nice so not intrusive 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.460
 not very strong it is also one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 limited edition and I have to say it 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.909
 is the biggest flop of all time 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.759
 I've never had it like this before 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.530
 a shampoo that was so disgusting I have to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.430
 say 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.600
 I use 21 products actually or 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.850
 I do not really use that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.130
 I do not think much of it 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.770
 Always a shampoo is a shampoo and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.480
 Flushing is still a conditioner and so is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.020
 nothing and nothing half 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.400
 and yes the problem is on vacation 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.650
 I really only had this shampoo 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.290
 there and people i can tell you 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.600
 if you have your curls if you 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.260
 dry hair then have your fingers 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.480
 from that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.380
 I 've washed my hair my 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.430
 hair or circling after 345 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.510
 days it depends what the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.100
 Products I use and the hair 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.610
 were dry no matter if you like it 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.220
 or let it air dry 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.250
 the hair was right after that 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.630
 we have a deadline and they have the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.920
 were so frizzy light that is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.040
 my hair never got amazing 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.750
 I can constantly look like this 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.880
 monstrum really so the hair on 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.910
 everywhere just not where they should be 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.620
 and that's why I think it's easy 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.860
 too little moisture given to me 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.209
 just does not have it 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.950
 this has problems with mine 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.880
 current job does not have to be for example 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.459
 I 've been here before 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 tried before and such problems 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.280
 I have never been with where I am 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.560
 Something of disappointed with this product 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.200
 Of course, I do not know how this is 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.239
 product now behaves with girls 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.890
 greasy with straight hair I can do that 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.230
 Unfortunately, you do not say anything about it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.290
 for mild with dry maybe too 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.549
 strained hair now really nothing 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.829
 Do not try that cost 145 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.680
 and in my opinion, I would have that 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.500
 money can also throw in garbage and 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.310
 then I is also balthasar oil 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.769
 also brought a limited edition more 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.600
 and yes what can I say in the two 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.430
 I've consumed so much for weeks 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.120
 So see that until then 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.640
 it is not productive at all and that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.160
 is also a very bad oil and 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.070
 who knows my videos success I love 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 I 'm getting tons of oil in my hair 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.470
 every day and it is not at all 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.050
 result in two weeks spent so much 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.110
 There is another oil, I know 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.150
 not now which I use either 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.450
 from alverde or lea I know it 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.850
 Not 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.200
 and that he said four months ago 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.650
 will be coming soon 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.430
 used up video that is if I have 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.530
 used and used almost every day for four months 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.390
 it is so rich and so good and this 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.150
 I can not recommend oil at all 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.200
 so it has my hair 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.120
 I do not know I have tons 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.010
 of it on my hair dark 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.370
 That's why my hair does not shine 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.110
 brought it has not my hair 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.110
 supplies as I oil that of others 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.660
 know and that is why this is an absolute 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.290
 flop from the smell just the same 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.840
 smell so these massage oil odors and 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.910
 here is ultra-light with UV protection 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.920
 non-greasy care formula for the 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.170
 daily care also for otherwise 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.210
 damaged hair and i should have 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.230
 I really wanted a holiday 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.480
 something else, that's me 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.850
 would have taken something else because 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.230
 so on forced these two products 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.220
 to use and wanted me back there 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.169
 not to pick 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.300
 so i had the opportunity 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.330
 really to test the products 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.350
 and yes what you say 75 milliliters 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.930
 has cost 245 here is that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.910
 I knew liter in it and girls 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.970
 buy the money not invested 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.330
 for something else but as already said 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.419
 every year is different it is mine 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.910
 experience it is a subjective opinion 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.669
 but for those who asked me 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.140
 I can test if I can 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.990
 could test 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.620
 and my opinion can say one 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.970
 total flop for me and yes I hope 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.919
 I forgot nothing if you 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.630
 As always, write me in 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.430
 the comments everything else 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.720
 if you still come up with something 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.520
 I should then you in the 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.150
 Write infobox and that 's me too 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.350
 I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.860
 we'll see each other again 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.860
 crisps
