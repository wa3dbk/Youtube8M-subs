on the standards the gases that are made

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
on the standards the gases that are made
are<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.790> place<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.170> tightening<00:00:19.680> up

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
are in place and now by tightening up

the nuts the cylinders are drawn tightly
to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> standard<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.670> may<00:00:23.880> cause<00:00:24.150> some

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to the standard and this may cause some

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900 
to the standard and this may cause some
binding<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.280> checking<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.820> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
binding so I'm just checking that we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880 
binding so I'm just checking that we
don't<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.360> any<00:00:27.540> binding<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> piston<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
don't have any binding of the piston in

made<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> fits<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.750> little

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
made and some of the fits are a little

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.510 
made and some of the fits are a little
bit<00:00:34.170> dubious<00:00:34.650> as<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> turns<00:00:36.060> out<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.600> okay

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
bit dubious as it turns out it's okay

very<00:01:18.430> scarred<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.180> I'm<00:01:19.930> going<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.230> do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
very scarred and I'm going to do

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.930 
very scarred and I'm going to do
something<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:21.130> shortly<00:01:21.550> but<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
something about this shortly but the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.820 
something about this shortly but the
first<00:01:22.180> thing<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.540> do<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.230> put<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.530> studs

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
first thing to do is to put the studs

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.210 
first thing to do is to put the studs
into<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.640> holes<00:01:24.850> with<00:01:25.150> some<00:01:25.330> Loctite<00:01:25.510> 603

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
into the holes with some Loctite 603

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.830 
into the holes with some Loctite 603
then<00:01:27.220> put<00:01:27.430> them<00:01:27.550> on<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:27.820> side<00:01:27.880> until<00:01:28.390> the

fully that's a good thing because the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.050 
fully that's a good thing because the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
would be to put them in the Forge or

when<00:03:56.600> I<00:03:56.630> was<00:03:56.780> putting<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.230> pistons<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.890> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
when I was putting the pistons on the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.920 
when I was putting the pistons on the
piston<00:03:58.490> rods<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.880> did<00:03:59.060> notice<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.540> quite<00:03:59.900> a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
piston rods I did notice that quite a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.510 
piston rods I did notice that quite a
lot<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.440> piston<00:04:00.830> rod<00:04:00.980> was<00:04:01.160> actually

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
lot of the piston rod was actually

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.300 
lot of the piston rod was actually
protruding<00:04:02.180> from<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.510> piston<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.650> now<00:04:03.890> by

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
protruding from the piston so now by

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.250 
protruding from the piston so now by
slackening<00:04:04.850> off<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.180> nut<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.660> center<00:04:05.690> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
slackening off the nut in the center and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.890 
slackening off the nut in the center and
using<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:06.950> pair<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.190> circlip<00:04:07.730> pliers<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.270> can

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
using a pair of circlip pliers I can

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.810 
using a pair of circlip pliers I can
move<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.230> piston<00:04:09.620> into<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:10.010> right<00:04:10.280> position

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
move the piston into the right position

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.449 
move the piston into the right position
on<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.120> threaded<00:04:11.540> piston<00:04:11.960> rod<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.280> have

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
on the threaded piston rod but to have

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.100 
on the threaded piston rod but to have
to<00:04:13.610> remember<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.270> cylinder<00:04:14.690> covers<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
to remember that the cylinder covers the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.930 
to remember that the cylinder covers the
time<00:04:15.320> made<00:04:15.590> also<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.489> bit<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.760> a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
time made also have a bit of a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.610 
time made also have a bit of a
protrusion<00:04:17.390> on<00:04:17.630> them<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:18.019> goes<00:04:18.200> down<00:04:18.410> into

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
protrusion on them that goes down into

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.340 
protrusion on them that goes down into
the<00:04:18.709> cylinder<00:04:19.010> slightly<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:20.870> need<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.170> make

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
the cylinder slightly so I need to make

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.350 
the cylinder slightly so I need to make
sure<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.859> piston<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.370> adjusted<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
sure that the piston is adjusted so that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.060 
sure that the piston is adjusted so that
it<00:04:23.600> doesn't<00:04:23.960> hit<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.140> cylinder<00:04:24.680> cover<00:04:24.860> at<00:04:25.040> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
it doesn't hit the cylinder cover at the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.790 
it doesn't hit the cylinder cover at the
top<00:04:25.340> either

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
top either

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.950 
top either
that<00:04:27.550> looks<00:04:27.789> about<00:04:28.000> right<00:04:28.240> for<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.539> piston

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
that looks about right for the piston

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.990 
that looks about right for the piston
travel<00:04:29.349> so<00:04:29.889> now<00:04:30.039> put<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.370> engine<00:04:30.669> back<00:04:30.699> to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
travel so now put the engine back to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.240 
travel so now put the engine back to
upright<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.629> spin<00:04:32.319> the<00:04:32.440> crankshaft<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.129> see

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
upright and spin the crankshaft and see

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.080 
upright and spin the crankshaft and see
how<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.580> feels

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
how it feels

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.510 
how it feels
yes<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.199> feels<00:04:35.229> slightly<00:04:35.979> tight<00:04:36.220> at<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
yes it feels slightly tight at the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.210 
yes it feels slightly tight at the
bottom<00:04:36.550> but<00:04:37.509> that<00:04:37.659> will<00:04:37.810> soon<00:04:38.050> wearing

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
bottom but that will soon wearing

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.940 
bottom but that will soon wearing
finally<00:04:41.000> once<00:04:41.660> again<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.260> painting<00:04:42.830> the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
finally once again I'm painting the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.100 
finally once again I'm painting the
flywheel<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.970> time<00:04:44.240> it's<00:04:44.750> very

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
flywheel and this time it's very

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.340 
flywheel and this time it's very
exciting<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.130> other<00:04:46.310> side<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:48.110> for<00:04:48.290> the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
exciting is the other side so for the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.990 
exciting is the other side so for the
next<00:04:48.440> couple<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.860> days<00:04:49.040> every<00:04:49.580> time<00:04:49.760> I'm<00:04:49.880> in
