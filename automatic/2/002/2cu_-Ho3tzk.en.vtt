00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the middle and just provide some kind of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.070 
the middle and just provide some kind of
barrier<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.300> once<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> that

barrier so that once they get to that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710 
barrier so that once they get to that
big<00:00:25.410> center<00:00:25.830> pouch<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.880> big<00:00:27.119> center<00:00:27.449> area

it<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.469> blocking<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.549> walls<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it up blocking it with walls when that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940 
it up blocking it with walls when that
happens<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.259> run<00:02:07.590> free

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
happens and you could just run free

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
happens and you could just run free
through<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.250> base<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.789> always<00:02:09.119> makes<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.539> big

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
through a base it always makes for big

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.290 
through a base it always makes for big
raids<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.319> bad<00:02:10.890> defenses<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.970> he's<00:02:12.120> not

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
raids and bad defenses now he's not

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.720 
raids and bad defenses now he's not
going<00:02:12.510> two<00:02:12.569> three-star<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.140> space<00:02:13.379> but<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
going two three-star this space but the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.580 
going two three-star this space but the
was<00:02:13.879> more<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.269> farming<00:02:14.690> raid<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.140> he<00:02:15.470> got

was more of a farming raid and he got

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
was more of a farming raid and he got
all<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.860> resources<00:02:16.159> so<00:02:16.550> that's<00:02:16.700> what<00:02:16.879> really

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
all the resources so that's what really

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.580 
all the resources so that's what really
counts<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.690> comes<00:02:17.870> down<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.049> farming

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
counts when it comes down to farming

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.440 
counts when it comes down to farming
