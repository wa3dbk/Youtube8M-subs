00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 good 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.820
 to reduce their energy bill 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 and now the heating accessible to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 all communities now know 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.520
 that we must consider the wood energy 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.540
 in all construction projects or 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
 of renovation 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.830
 ten years ago when the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 cilouest is inaccessible while the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 civil engineering storage led a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
 budget overrun the masters 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.869
 had to give up the plate 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.770
 forest in favor of granulated see 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 fossil fuels 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.879
 in recent years the suppliers 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.360
 of shredded wood is equipped with trucks 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.550
 blowers 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 thanks to this technology of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.880
 boiler increasingly large 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 can now burn this fuel 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:52.010
 ecological economy 2008 on room 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 stone and firewood wood logs 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.370
 densified are distributors of 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.199
 wood pellets since the beginning of the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.729
 creation of this high level energy we 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.610
 actually invested in the truck 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.590
 blower did about six thousand 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.050
 cubic meters to the year where everything is 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.100
 blown all 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.780
 basically we're part of a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.619
 quality charter so we do that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 of ag 30 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.229
 we radiate over an area of ​​80 km 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.229
 around salbris 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.370
 this site departs from the community of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.250
 common malesherbois who rehabilitated 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.950
 an old shopping center in the center 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.590
 youth hostel is the center of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.090
 this original gas on this center 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.040
 commercial was a fuel boiler for 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.330
 reasons of economy and will 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.370
 orientation on energy wood 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.920
 it was decided to implement this 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.570
 type of boiler and boiler we 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.270
 are on a boiler room with a 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 mixed boiler 80 kg the boiler 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.660
 the silo and the blowing air are 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.670
 same level 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.369
 it gives us an advantage to have a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.500
 facility for the implantation of this type 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.510
 and which perfectly suited the site 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.390
 who is rehabilitated we are on a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.430
 silo of his completeness which is filled I 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 believe four times a year by means of a 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.080
 blower truck that offers ease 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:38.140
 filling and facilitate access by 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:39.910
 Too much security around the truck 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.489
 trans manu blower can blow the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.650
 plate lg 30 and I have 50 on a length 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.930
 up to 40 meters and a vertical drop 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.000
 up to 8 meters the flow is 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 about a cubic meter a minute and the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.760
 truck volume of 30 cubic meters and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.760
 emptied in half an hour 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.560
 the box is equipped with an engine 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.690
 autonomous 60 horses whose insulation 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.250
 phonic delivery guarantee to a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.250
 sound level of 85 decibels
