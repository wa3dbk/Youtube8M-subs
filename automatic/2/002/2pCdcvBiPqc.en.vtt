himself<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.090> she'll<00:02:28.480> be<00:02:28.600> surprised<00:02:29.139> with

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
himself I think she'll be surprised with

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.900 
himself I think she'll be surprised with
ease<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.630> window<00:02:33.510> jobs<00:02:34.510> third<00:02:35.790> from<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
ease of that window jobs third from the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.699 
ease of that window jobs third from the
top<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.299> screen<00:02:37.600> she<00:02:37.959> gets<00:02:38.170> away<00:02:38.380> well<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
top of the screen she gets away well and

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.259 
top of the screen she gets away well and
look<00:02:38.829> at<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> distance<00:02:39.579> she<00:02:39.670> has<00:02:39.850> over<00:02:40.120> these

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
look at the distance she has over these

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.379 
look at the distance she has over these
ladies<00:02:40.720> already<00:02:41.370> good<00:02:42.370> strong<00:02:42.970> run<00:02:43.180> off<00:02:43.359> that

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
ladies already good strong run off that

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.690 
ladies already good strong run off that
trail<00:02:43.870> leg<00:02:44.139> left<00:02:44.590> leg<00:02:44.709> hits<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.220> floor<00:02:45.459> well

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
trail leg left leg hits the floor well

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.129 
trail leg left leg hits the floor well
and<00:02:45.850> she<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.299> keeps<00:02:46.510> pulling<00:02:46.780> away<00:02:47.019> from

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
and she just keeps pulling away from

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.530 
and she just keeps pulling away from
them<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.730> cracking<00:02:48.730> race<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.120> think<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.389> will

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
them a cracking race I think this will

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.360 
them a cracking race I think this will
fill<00:02:49.660> her<00:02:49.750> with<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> lot<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.200> confidence<00:02:50.500> she

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
fill her with a lot of confidence she

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.160 
fill her with a lot of confidence she
needs<00:02:51.519> now<00:02:51.639> to<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.910> on<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.599> quick<00:02:52.810> track

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
needs now to get on a really quick track

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.410 
needs now to get on a really quick track
in<00:02:53.889> Central<00:02:54.430> Europe<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.970> she<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.239> really

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
in Central Europe so she can really

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.860 
in Central Europe so she can really
close<00:02:55.840> another<00:02:56.560> very<00:02:57.489> fast<00:02:57.819> time<00:02:58.090> indeed<00:02:58.480> here

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
close another very fast time indeed here

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.120 
close another very fast time indeed here
she<00:02:59.079> is<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.440> blocks<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.829> I've<00:03:00.010> actually

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
she is out the blocks and I've actually

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.190 
she is out the blocks and I've actually
spent<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.609> bit<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.760> time<00:03:00.910> working<00:03:01.359> with<00:03:01.540> her<00:03:01.720> to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
spent a bit of time working with her to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.539 
spent a bit of time working with her to
that<00:03:02.319> first<00:03:02.590> hurdle<00:03:02.829> because<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:03.250> always

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
that first hurdle because I always

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.129 
that first hurdle because I always
thought<00:03:03.730> she<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.120> little<00:03:04.420> bit<00:03:04.540> soft<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.049> it

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
thought she was a little bit soft to it

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.440 
thought she was a little bit soft to it
and<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.349> didn't<00:03:05.650> set<00:03:05.829> her<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:05.980> well<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:07.180> now

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
and it didn't set her up well but now

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.539 
and it didn't set her up well but now
look<00:03:07.810> at<00:03:07.930> her<00:03:08.019> well<00:03:08.200> she<00:03:08.349> keeps<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:09.010> she

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549
