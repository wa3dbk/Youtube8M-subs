00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.370 

today<00:00:07.819> we're<00:00:08.120> going<00:00:08.269> to<00:00:08.360> try

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
today we're going to try

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
today we're going to try
clock<00:00:09.760> this<00:00:10.760> is<00:00:10.910> kind<00:00:11.090> of<00:00:11.120> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210 

because<00:00:15.510> it<00:00:15.630> uses<00:00:15.990> copper<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.010> think

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
because it uses copper and I think

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.550 
because it uses copper and I think
that's<00:00:17.369> zinc<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.960> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.200> neat

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
that's zinc there but it's kind of neat

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
that's zinc there but it's kind of neat
to<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.640> done<00:00:20.820> when<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.150> think

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
to see what can be done when you think

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.570 
to see what can be done when you think
outside<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> box<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.010> inside<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
outside the box so let's go inside the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.900 
outside the box so let's go inside the
box<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.450> they're<00:00:24.599> doing

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
box to see what they're doing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
let's see what we've got fit all the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.139 
let's see what we've got fit all the
pieces<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.900> instructions<00:00:34.670> later<00:00:38.120> yeah

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
pieces and instructions later yeah

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.020 
pieces and instructions later yeah
plastic<00:00:39.840> bag<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.980> recycle<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.150 

that's<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.179> right<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.730> recyclable<00:00:55.160> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that's all right it is recyclable and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's all right it is recyclable and
here<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:58.609> parts<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
here are actually the parts that do the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.259 
here are actually the parts that do the
trick

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
trick

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.440 
trick
it's<00:01:01.199> pretty<00:01:01.410> neat<00:01:02.239> not<00:01:03.239> much<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.749> it<00:01:03.780> really

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
it's pretty neat not much to it really

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.930 
it's pretty neat not much to it really
as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> notice<00:01:06.870> we've<00:01:07.050> got<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.230> couple<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
as you notice we've got a couple of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.510 
as you notice we've got a couple of
strips<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> couple<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.430> copper<00:01:13.370> what<00:01:14.370> they

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
strips and a couple of copper what they

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.610 
strips and a couple of copper what they
really<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.120> when<00:01:15.870> you<00:01:16.050> put<00:01:16.230> them<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
really do is when you put them in the

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.160 
really do is when you put them in the
dirt<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:18.300> difference<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> two

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
dirt the difference between the two

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
dirt the difference between the two
metals<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.579> dirt<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.939> between<00:01:21.299> creates<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
metals and the dirt in between creates a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.280 
metals and the dirt in between creates a
little<00:01:21.899> battery<00:01:22.820> that's<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> trick<00:01:24.290> okay

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
little battery that's the trick okay

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.249 
little battery that's the trick okay
look<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.600> screwdriver<00:01:28.790> meeting

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
look at this it's a screwdriver meeting

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
look at this it's a screwdriver meeting
and<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.590> box<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:35.090> obviously

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and in this box we have obviously

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.149 
and in this box we have obviously
there's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> kink<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.369> what<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.520> up

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159
