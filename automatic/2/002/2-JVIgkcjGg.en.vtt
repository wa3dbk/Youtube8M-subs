00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello, I 'm going to prepare an Italian meringue 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.850
 a very versatile recipe that you 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.559
 can use it to cover goals or serve 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.900
 with desserts in general 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.390
 the sugar most suitable for doing this 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.650
 recipe is the granulated sugar union of 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.589
 sugar for recipe just put in a 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.640
 pot of sugar 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.640
 along with water 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:39.270
 and then I'll stir until the crystals of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 are melted and this syrup is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.910
 it starts to boil it starts to boil I do not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.780
 I can move, you have to wait for this 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.460
 causes a soft bullet point to arrive 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.460
 I'll show you one point. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.030
 look at this step the house is already 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.699
 starting to boil and I will not move 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.059
 Of course, if I touch this house 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.739
 can sugar to now while tail feb 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.739
 I'll beat the egg whites 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.090
 the white is already in the snow and I 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.090
 I'll see the tail point. 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.689
 this is the ideal first point in 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.610
 because of dense and colorless or 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.939
 last drop drops thick and forms a thread 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.619
 they perceive why it is called thick wire or 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.350
 soft bullet 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.110
 if I take a drop of this cause in a 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.869
 bowl with cold water will form a 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 soft bullet so the name of the tail 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.289
 At this point I'm going to dump right 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.569
 on the egg whites with the mixer 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.569
 connected at high speed 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:13.040
 it's just beating until it's combined 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.220
 now the medium has already made its debut and is 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.220
 Score 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.340
 look at the texture it looks firm and creamy 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.120
 with this danger you can cover a 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.400
 serve with fruit salad with 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.450
 ice cream and another sweet one that you 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.510
 prefer 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.460
 he gets soft he gets shiny he 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.490
 no sugar so you can too 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.200
 cover lemon pies a little thing that 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.780
 I forgot to tell you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.430
 you can also taste the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.100
 meringue can put drops of lemon 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.320
 the lemon cones orange raspberries 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.480
 or some other aroma of your choice 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.500
