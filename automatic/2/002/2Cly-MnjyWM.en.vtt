 if now on the subject of his dribbling this opa 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.109
 studying deeply and I feel a lot 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.649
 because today we should really prepare for what is coming 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.329
 in chile a new chile 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.329
 with a female president 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.139
 Thus 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.559
 It is imperative that they did not check what they prepare and we know what the 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.189
 big differences 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.449
 because difference 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.600
 only in the physical but that 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.569
 the total construction 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.129
 percent 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.129
 of the water 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.379
 I've been reading for example the island women are must some men 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.089

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.449
 me here and I discovered for example percent that women think with the 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.249
 heart 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.249
 and we drive him crazy crazy his head 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.799
 there there is a difference its quantity 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.120
 I read the book 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.209
 of the family remains the same 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.209
 who knows agur assured boudou 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.579
 now be the last place in the world ranking 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.749
 I read and I'm going there I discovered for example the difference 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.889
 between 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.469
 sex the reason 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.199
 no sex lose 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.169
 erotic sex and something very nice style that is like a feather passing it 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.789
 for agricultural activities 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.789
 if you've lost this with the cookie 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.830
 everything to the thread marian 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.830
 everything that goes between Sunday 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.069
 from there for example 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.179
 reads also to deaf pillar who is a psychologist dated in the fifth region 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.520
 and really good the book arises the opportunity that I can not say that believes 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.460
 that one do soon 1 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
 the book is called however says that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 and really impacted there I learned 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.919
 that the woman's thought is one more thought 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:01.990
 instead the thought of man 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.099
 a fish a very different thought very distant troops 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.270
 the urban pursues objective 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.270
 that is, a real thought 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.150
 no no no no you have to follow because the kings were that is real 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 this colony 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.460
 Maybe that's why you realize that there is something we do that does not seem 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.660
 very normal but that the woman the fact that it was always prolongs what 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.999
 pursued goal in life 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:37.680
 instead the woman 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.789
 with your magical thinking other things have already happened for example 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.129
 no santiago leader for example to san fernando 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.129
 with this objective you will reach affect 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.320
 instead the woman did not exist in the magical thought 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.030
 and call well thanks the precise time spaces for the plot to 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.490

 she puts in her happiness she is always out, it is worth saying they give control 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:15.939
 remote of his life 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.939

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.979
