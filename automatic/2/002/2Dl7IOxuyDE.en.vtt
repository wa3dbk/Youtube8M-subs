would<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.410> boring<00:03:01.680> because<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.160> more<00:03:02.310> like

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
would be boring because it's more like

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.980 
would be boring because it's more like
the<00:03:02.610> original<00:03:02.730> dead<00:03:03.150> space<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.660> still<00:03:03.870> very

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
the original dead space it's still very

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.960 
the original dead space it's still very
similar<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> main<00:03:04.680> game<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.280> it's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
similar to the main game but it's it's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
similar to the main game but it's it's
just<00:03:06.150> more<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> original<00:03:06.690> um<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:08.040> thing

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
just more like the original um the thing

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.130 
just more like the original um the thing
I<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.490> thinking<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.850> doing<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.750> called

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I was thinking of doing is is called

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.380 
I was thinking of doing is is called
pure<00:03:10.470> survival<00:03:10.830> where<00:03:11.280> everything<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.209> done

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
pure survival where everything is done

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
pure survival where everything is done
like<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:13.020> resources<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.800> build

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
like the resources you have to build

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.699 
like the resources you have to build
everything<00:03:14.459> health<00:03:14.820> ammo<00:03:15.390> guns<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.440> can't

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
everything health ammo guns you can't

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.490 
everything health ammo guns you can't
just<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:17.100> know<00:03:17.220> pick<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.750> health<00:03:18.750> or<00:03:18.959> ammo<00:03:19.290> uh

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
just you know pick up health or ammo uh

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.009 
just you know pick up health or ammo uh
and<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.239> that'll<00:03:21.510> make<00:03:21.540> things<00:03:21.660> really

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
and I think that'll make things really

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.210 
and I think that'll make things really
interesting<00:03:22.470> that's<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.650> playthrough<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.040> want

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
interesting that's a playthrough I want

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.449 
interesting that's a playthrough I want
to<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.340> myself<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.100> it'll<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.280> make

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
to do myself and I think it'll just make

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.509 
to do myself and I think it'll just make
things<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.760> lot<00:03:26.880> more<00:03:26.989> intense<00:03:27.989> both<00:03:28.800> for<00:03:29.310> me<00:03:29.400> to

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
