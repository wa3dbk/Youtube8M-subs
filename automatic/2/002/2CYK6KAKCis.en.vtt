too because they need to playmaker but

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.840 
too because they need to playmaker but
after<00:04:43.860> they<00:04:43.950> picked<00:04:44.100> up<00:04:44.250> eric<00:04:44.490> decker<00:04:44.640> they

don't really need any more playmakers
there<00:04:46.560> this<00:04:46.800> was<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> really<00:04:47.310> deep<00:04:47.730> wide

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
there this was a really deep wide

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.450 
there this was a really deep wide
receiver<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.140> know<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:49.680> had<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> lot<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.160> deep

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
receiver you know that had a lot of deep

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.850 
receiver you know that had a lot of deep
wide<00:04:51.030> receiver<00:04:51.510> depth<00:04:52.170> i<00:04:52.410> guess<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:52.800> say

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
wide receiver depth i guess you can say

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.550 
wide receiver depth i guess you can say
it<00:04:53.010> was<00:04:53.100> depth<00:04:53.370> and<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:54.810> decided<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.350> know

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
it was depth and they decided you know

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.280 
it was depth and they decided you know
they<00:04:55.830> didn't<00:04:56.010> need<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.160> lot<00:04:56.220> of<00:04:56.340> receiver<00:04:56.790> and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
they didn't need a lot of receiver and

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.600 
they didn't need a lot of receiver and
corners<00:04:58.290> they<00:04:58.800> needed<00:04:59.070> corners<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.550> they

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
corners they needed corners and they

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.820 
corners they needed corners and they
needed<00:04:59.790> a<00:04:59.910> safety<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.840> they<00:05:00.990> got<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.140> safety<00:05:01.410> and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
needed a safety so they got a safety and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.980 
needed a safety so they got a safety and
they<00:05:02.310> got<00:05:02.490> two<00:05:02.700> corners<00:05:03.180> from<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.420> draft<00:05:03.750> so

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
they got two corners from the draft so

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.300 
they got two corners from the draft so
hopefully<00:05:04.290> that<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.590> help<00:05:04.680> them<00:05:04.920> out<00:05:05.010> towards

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
hopefully that can help them out towards

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.680 
hopefully that can help them out towards
the<00:05:05.370> end<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.610> season<00:05:06.000> or<00:05:06.150> an<00:05:06.270> end<00:05:06.420> towards

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
the end of the season or an end towards

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.810 
the end of the season or an end towards
we're<00:05:07.050> not<00:05:07.170> really<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> end<00:05:07.560> but<00:05:07.980> towards<00:05:08.730> the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
we're not really the end but towards the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.890 
we're not really the end but towards the
beginning<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.240> season<00:05:09.390> but<00:05:09.630> hopefully

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900
