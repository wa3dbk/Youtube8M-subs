half<00:00:12.059> inches<00:00:12.540> tall<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.530> difference<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.009> lie

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
half inches tall the difference is lie

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.010 
half inches tall the difference is lie
in<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> Gidget<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.570> table<00:00:15.900> has<00:00:15.990> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
in that the Gidget one table has a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.730 
in that the Gidget one table has a
smaller<00:00:16.379> opening<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:17.130> 17<00:00:18.119> by<00:00:18.690> 7<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.260> 3/8

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
smaller opening it's 17 by 7 and 3/8

smaller opening it's 17 by 7 and 3/8
inches<00:00:20.100> tall<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.910> also<00:00:21.060> made<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.480> particle

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

board<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.859> our<00:00:23.220> Gidget<00:00:23.820> 2<00:00:24.029> table<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.630> made

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
board where our Gidget 2 table is made

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
board where our Gidget 2 table is made
for<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> bigger<00:00:25.470> sewing<00:00:25.800> machine<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.400> 24

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
for the bigger sewing machine so it's 24

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
by 12
it's<00:00:28.140> made<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> tougher<00:00:28.920> MDF<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.640> support

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it's made of a tougher MDF to support

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
it's made of a tougher MDF to support
those<00:00:30.210> heavier<00:00:30.539> machines<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.650> we've

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
those heavier machines as well as we've

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
those heavier machines as well as we've
got<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> bevel<00:00:32.520> around<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.600> insert

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
got a bevel around here for your insert

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
got a bevel around here for your insert
so<00:00:34.079> it'll<00:00:34.290> lay<00:00:34.440> flat<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.160> then<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> last

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so it'll lay flat and then the last

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.139 
so it'll lay flat and then the last
thing<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:38.129> wheels<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.030> when

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
thing it has it has two wheels so when

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.180 
thing it has it has two wheels so when
you<00:00:39.239> fold<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.750> it'll<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.649> portable

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you fold it up it'll be more portable

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
you fold it up it'll be more portable
one<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> things<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.210> wanted<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
one of the things we wanted to kind of

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
one of the things we wanted to kind of
go<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.579> you've<00:00:44.760> got

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
go over with you is when you've got

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
go over with you is when you've got
machine<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> platform<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
machine or the platform down you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
machine or the platform down you
definitely<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
definitely do not want to have your

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.840 
definitely do not want to have your
machine<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.219> you're<00:00:50.340> moving<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.700> up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
machine on here when you're moving it up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.119 
machine on here when you're moving it up
and<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.449> break<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> mechanism<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and down we can break the mechanism and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.709 
and down we can break the mechanism and
you<00:00:53.219> always<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> hear<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.090> sound<00:00:54.449> when

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you always want to hear this sound when

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
you always want to hear this sound when
you<00:00:54.840> grab<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.079> handle<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> hear

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you grab the handle you want to hear

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.490 
you grab the handle you want to hear
that<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.449> means<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.840> locked<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that because that means it's locked in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
that because that means it's locked in
position<00:00:58.850> sometimes<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.000> you've<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> down

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
position sometimes if you've got it down

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
position sometimes if you've got it down
you<00:01:01.410> may<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:01.949> locked

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you may think it's locked

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.920 
you may think it's locked
but<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.719> push<00:01:03.899> down

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
but it's actually not when you push down

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
but it's actually not when you push down
on<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> make<00:01:04.799> sure<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.369> hear<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
on it to make sure that you hear that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
on it to make sure that you hear that
sound<00:01:06.409> coming<00:01:07.409> over<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.189> thing

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sound coming over here the other thing

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.820 
sound coming over here the other thing
we<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.760> over<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.330> his<00:01:09.750> securing<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
we want to go over with his securing the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
we want to go over with his securing the
legs<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.760> important<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.270> both

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
legs it's very important in both

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620 
legs it's very important in both
cabinets<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> put<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.880> legs<00:01:15.180> support

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
cabinets that you put your legs support

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.740 
cabinets that you put your legs support
in<00:01:16.009> like<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> step<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
in like so and then you step on it to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.219 
in like so and then you step on it to
hear<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> sound<00:01:20.240> both<00:01:21.240> legs<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
hear this sound both legs you want to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.899 
hear this sound both legs you want to
hear<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.530> nice<00:01:22.799> tight<00:01:23.130> sound<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.759> that

hear that nice tight sound because that
make<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> secure<00:01:25.340> moving<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> gadget

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
make it secure moving over to the gadget

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
make it secure moving over to the gadget
too<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.810> comes<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> velcro<00:01:29.430> strap<00:01:29.460> and
