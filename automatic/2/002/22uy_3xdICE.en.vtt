Autosports<00:00:05.549> short<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> tell<00:00:06.480> you

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
Autosports short we're going to tell you

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.150 
Autosports short we're going to tell you
why<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:13.139> makes<00:00:13.349> an<00:00:13.590> aqua<00:00:13.980> battery

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
why so what makes an aqua battery

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.189 
why so what makes an aqua battery
different<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.089> typical<00:00:15.389> lead<00:00:15.839> acid

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
different than a typical lead acid

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.410 
different than a typical lead acid
battery<00:00:16.529> well<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> couple<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.670> things<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.210> is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
battery well a couple of things one is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480 
battery well a couple of things one is
it<00:00:18.570> doesn't<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.770> liquid<00:00:20.400> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it doesn't actually have a liquid in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
it doesn't actually have a liquid in
there<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.760> actually<00:00:21.090> more<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> gel<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
there it's actually more of a gel and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.859 
there it's actually more of a gel and
it's<00:00:22.590> held<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> sponge<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.789> second<00:00:24.449> thing<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's held in a sponge a second thing is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.109 
it's held in a sponge a second thing is
that<00:00:25.470> instead<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.039> having<00:00:26.400> individual<00:00:26.910> lead

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that instead of having individual lead

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390 
that instead of having individual lead
plates<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.689> has<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> spiral<00:00:28.619> core<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
plates it has a spiral core and that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
plates it has a spiral core and that
sponge<00:00:30.330> sits<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.720> between<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.380> holds

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
sponge sits in between there and holds

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
sponge sits in between there and holds
the<00:00:31.830> acid<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.279> place<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> best<00:00:33.660> things

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the acid in place one of the best things

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.479 
the acid in place one of the best things
about<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> Altima<00:00:34.620> battery<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.309> take

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
about the Altima battery if you take

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
about the Altima battery if you take
care<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> last<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.930> whole

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
care of it it's going to last a whole

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.049 
care of it it's going to last a whole
lot<00:00:37.380> longer<00:00:37.440> than<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.190> typical<00:00:38.340> lead<00:00:38.730> acid

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
lot longer than your typical lead acid

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.600 
lot longer than your typical lead acid
battery<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> gel<00:00:40.890> basically

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
battery because this is a gel basically

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.330 
battery because this is a gel basically
encase<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.450> sponge<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.739> no<00:00:43.950> leakage

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
encase in a sponge there is no leakage

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.180 
encase in a sponge there is no leakage
therefore<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.239> won't<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> any<00:00:45.930> corrosion

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
therefore you won't have any corrosion

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
therefore you won't have any corrosion
now<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> racing<00:00:47.940> environment<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.629> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
now in the racing environment this is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
now in the racing environment this is
especially<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> worry

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
especially good you don't have to worry

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 
especially good you don't have to worry
about<00:00:50.460> any<00:00:50.640> spillage<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.270> those<00:00:51.570> extreme

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
about any spillage in those extreme

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
about any spillage in those extreme
track<00:00:52.469> conditions<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.820> heavy-duty

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
track conditions or that heavy-duty

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
track conditions or that heavy-duty
off-road<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.920> batteries<00:00:56.370> typically

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
off-road now these batteries typically

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.459 
off-road now these batteries typically
have<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.180> cranking<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.719> preserve<00:00:58.050> than

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
have more cranking and preserve than

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
have more cranking and preserve than
your<00:00:58.680> factory<00:00:58.949> battery<00:00:59.640> without<00:01:00.480> losing

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
your factory battery without losing

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
your factory battery without losing
voltage<00:01:01.230> I'll<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
voltage I'll get into more on that in a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.349 
voltage I'll get into more on that in a
minute

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
minute

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
minute
another<00:01:04.170> thing<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> let's<00:01:05.159> say<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> leave

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
another thing is let's say you do leave

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
another thing is let's say you do leave
your<00:01:05.909> lights<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.110> battery<00:01:07.290> drains

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
your lights on and the battery drains

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.039 
your lights on and the battery drains
and<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> need<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> jumpstart<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> factory

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and you need to jumpstart it a factory

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
and you need to jumpstart it a factory
lead<00:01:10.200> acid<00:01:10.560> battery<00:01:10.950> creates<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> toxic

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
lead acid battery creates a lot of toxic

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 
lead acid battery creates a lot of toxic
gases<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.290> explosive<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:14.490> create

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
gases that are explosive these create

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.550 
gases that are explosive these create
much<00:01:15.299> less<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.869> much<00:01:16.080> safer<00:01:16.290> when

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
much less so it's much safer when

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.890 
much less so it's much safer when
jump-starting<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.189> car<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:18.570> these

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
jump-starting your car now these

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.899 
jump-starting your car now these
batteries<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.409> discharge<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.580> regular

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
batteries don't discharge like a regular

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
batteries don't discharge like a regular
lead<00:01:21.240> acid<00:01:21.570> battery<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
lead acid battery so if you have a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.109 
lead acid battery so if you have a
vehicle<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> don't<00:01:23.460> drive<00:01:23.700> every<00:01:23.939> day

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
vehicle that you don't drive every day

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.490 
vehicle that you don't drive every day
or<00:01:24.330> maybe<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.750> custom<00:01:24.990> car<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
or maybe a little custom car in the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
or maybe a little custom car in the
garage<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> great<00:01:26.490> option<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.030> bought<00:01:27.540> my

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
garage it's a great option I bought my

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
garage it's a great option I bought my
first<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.229> 12<00:01:28.530> years<00:01:28.740> ago<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.340> still<00:01:29.579> starts

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
first one 12 years ago it still starts

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
first one 12 years ago it still starts
my<00:01:30.060> car<00:01:30.299> today<00:01:30.680> optima<00:01:31.680> basically<00:01:32.070> has<00:01:32.220> three

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
my car today optima basically has three

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
my car today optima basically has three
batteries<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> blue<00:01:33.570> top<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> red<00:01:34.170> top

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
batteries they have a blue top a red top

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
batteries they have a blue top a red top
and<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.619> yellow<00:01:34.799> top<00:01:35.040> we're<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and a yellow top we're not going to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520 
and a yellow top we're not going to
worry<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> blue<00:01:36.540> top<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.140> designed

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
worry about the blue top that's designed

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
worry about the blue top that's designed
for<00:01:37.680> marine<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.130> we're<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> focus<00:01:39.180> on

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
for marine use we're going to focus on

the red top and the yellow top now we're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.469 
the red top and the yellow top now we're
going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> start<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.759> talking<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
going to start by talking about the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
going to start by talking about the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
they do that is they change the acid

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
they do that is they change the acid
content<00:01:59.549> around<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.469> won't

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
content around a little bit so it won't

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
content around a little bit so it won't
have<00:02:01.890> quite<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.490> cold<00:02:02.790> cranking<00:02:03.060> amps<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.570> the

want<00:02:18.960> otherwise<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:20.130> will<00:02:20.220> happen<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.670> every

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
want otherwise what will happen is every

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.970 
want otherwise what will happen is every
time<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.600> base<00:02:21.900> hits<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:22.470> hard<00:02:22.620> you'll

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
time that base hits really hard you'll

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.950 
time that base hits really hard you'll
see<00:02:23.160> your<00:02:23.310> lights<00:02:23.520> dim<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> yellow<00:02:24.660> top

see your lights dim with the yellow top

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.320 
see your lights dim with the yellow top
it's<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> eliminate<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.090> now

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
it's going to eliminate that so now

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.520 
it's going to eliminate that so now
we're<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> talk<00:02:27.780> about<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.110> red<00:02:28.290> top

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
we're going to talk about the red top

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.110 
we're going to talk about the red top
now<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> red<00:02:29.100> top<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.520> designed<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.090> a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
now the red top is designed to be a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.090 
now the red top is designed to be a
starter<00:02:30.540> battery<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.040> to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
starter battery now this is going to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.620 
starter battery now this is going to
have<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> little<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.670> cold<00:02:33.000> cranking<00:02:33.270> amps

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
have a little more cold cranking amps

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.150 
have a little more cold cranking amps
and<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.080> reason<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.010> has<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and the reason is is because it has a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.790 
and the reason is is because it has a
little<00:02:35.310> different<00:02:35.640> compound<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.420> acid<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
little different compound of acid in the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.430 
little different compound of acid in the
battery<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.090> layman's<00:02:39.390> terms<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.930> more

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
battery so in layman's terms the more

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.230 
battery so in layman's terms the more
cold<00:02:40.680> cranking<00:02:40.890> amps<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.940> easier

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
cold cranking amps you have the easier

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.640 
cold cranking amps you have the easier
it's<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> fire<00:02:42.990> up<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.200> hard<00:02:43.560> to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
it's going to be to fire up that hard to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
it's going to be to fire up that hard to
start<00:02:43.890> vehicle<00:02:44.280> now<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:44.880> has<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> cold

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
start vehicle now this has a cold

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
cranking rating of 800 amps now what

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.340 
cranking rating of 800 amps now what
that<00:02:49.350> means<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.580> will<00:02:50.820> supply<00:02:51.180> 800<00:02:51.960> amps

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
that means is this will supply 800 amps

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.220 
that means is this will supply 800 amps
