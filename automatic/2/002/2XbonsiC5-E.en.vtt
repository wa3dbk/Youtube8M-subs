00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.370
 hello today and trasher tell 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.799
 you about board game friday in the wild 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
 who quietly lived on a tropical 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.720
 island and here like a bolt from the blue 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.580
 sky on your head falls Robinson 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.539
 Naturally you need it as soon as possible 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.580
 get rid of your wondrous island 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.490
 inside a small box there are three fields and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.470
 several decks of different cards for 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.700
 Begin to put on the table three 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.580
 playing fields 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.120
 three step cards with a firebox 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.210
 that's the way the card is aging very 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.180
 stupid returns to the box remaining 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.570
 cards are divided into two piles 7 ordinary 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.870
 and 3 complex they are mixed separately 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 and then the ordinary ones are put complicated and all 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.109
 together on the field of aging 18 starters 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.739
 cards are shuffled and put on their 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.800
 field of 30 hazard cards form a deck 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.560
 in his field 20 points of life 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.250
 are located next to the attack deck and yet 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 2 separately finally from the deck of pirates 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.040
 randomly two cards are selected and all 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.200
 ready for arrival robinzon and every 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.439
 the game move robinzon will meet with 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.090
 hazards and try to overcome them he 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.060
 unlocks the top two cards from the deck 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.880
 hazards chooses one and the second 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.610
 sends a reset on a hazard map 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.040
 on the left is the number of cards that can be 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 open from the deck of attack for free 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320
 to overcome the danger level 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.119
 the hazard is indicated on the right in the first round 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 green in 2 yellow and in the third red 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.500
 the player opens free cards and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.350
 compares the sum of the numbers on them force and 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.549
 threats if this amount is equal or greater 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 threat forces 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.729
 the player takes this card by turning it over 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.070
 now it's his new card which 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.289
 goes to his personal discharge along with 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.810
 used in this round of cards 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.869
 if free to overcome the threat is not 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.800
 managed before the player gets a choice he 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.020
 may be 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.770
 and give so many lives what is the difference 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.020
 between the level of the threat and his attack power in 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.390
 this case Zak 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.410
 every health unit given he 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.780
 can burn 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.440
 that is, remove any card from the game 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.420
 attacks of course this is a great way 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.180
 get rid of minus cards however 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 burning card aging does not cost 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.000
 one a in two health units if the player 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 thinks he can still win 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.710
 he can pay a health unit 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.620
 to open another attack card and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.590
 add it to your amount so he can 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.490
 keep doing as much as you want 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.350
 many maps 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.080
 especially on the game 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.870
 threat maps have special properties 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.570
 they are played at the request of the player and 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.850
 they can all help him greatly 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.450
 naturally discussed in detail in 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.940
 the rules 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.690
 and here are the negative properties on the maps 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.060
 Aging is always obligatory to play if 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.130
 the player runs out of attack cards he 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.910
 add your own reset top card 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.910
 aging 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.090
 and then mixes and makes new 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.760
 deck of attack as soon as the threat is allowed 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.610
 for any benefit the player pulls 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.490
 two new cards and chooses a new one 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.740
 the threat will continue this way until 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.140
 will end the deck of threats then 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.290
 shuffled their reset and starts 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.190
 new round but now on yellow 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.650
 threat level 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.140
 and then on red as soon as 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.360
 red level of difficulty will come to an end 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.690
 the player will face two 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.209
 pirates their strength is indicated on the coat of arms 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.450
 and the number of attack cards in the upper left 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.940
 The corner of the pirates usually have more 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.160
 strong negative properties for a player 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.040
 but only consistently defeating both 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.690
 threat cards robinzon wins the game and 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
 floating away from the island 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.590
 but if during the game he loses 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 all health you have to pay yet 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.510
 the party will be lost friday 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.570
 it is very easy to learn but 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.919
 difficult enough game to win exactly 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.890
 for one player 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.650
 and if it seems easy to you rule 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.620
 prepared four levels for you 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.900
 difficulties dare to survive on the island already 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.800
 fairly aged and lower 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.800
 health
