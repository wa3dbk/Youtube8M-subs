00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
guess having a job isn't so bad and it's

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
guess having a job isn't so bad and it's
weird<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:52.000> be<00:01:52.119> saying<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:53.079> but

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.270
