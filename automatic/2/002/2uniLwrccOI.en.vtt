00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.160
 today to all welcome to lethal crisis' 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.830
 and I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.690
 manual taco thrower good 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.380
 I call them tacos I do not know how they 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.060
 I will call you and that is to explain a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.900
 little the truth is that the way 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 throw projectiles bullets whatever you want 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 best in the world is the simplest not the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 more complicated gun but the most 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.880
 simple and the most powerful and good this is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 a very powerful method and the simplest one since 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.289
 he had made many pistols but the most 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 simple is this and it's just to take the 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:40.260
 gum well with the index finger and thumb 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.780
 take it from the front throw it back 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.780
 put the projectile here 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.090
 and the truth that the firing power 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.900
 it's still very strong and now it 's a result 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.900
 a little the strength of this manual weapon 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.570
 well then get to make the tacos and 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.030
 you're just going to need a lot of 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.320
 all and paper but we're going 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.090
 bending like I'm going to do 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.800
 if you do not want to throw some tacos like that 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.640
 you just have to do the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.640
 weapon you want 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 that just like that and bending 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.380
 and when we have a fold like that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380
 and we have it 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.300
 we have to place it that way by the angle 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.300
 we do not take 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.340
 is that it is very powerful that the camera almost 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.219
 nor does he catch it let's make a taco more 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.219
 bigger with this 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.750
 and now 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.900
 having it like this all let's look towards this 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.900
 side 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.890
 Y 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.830
 force 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 teach a little of the scope and more or 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.870
 less but in general the scope that 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.400
 it's big here we talk about 17 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.269
 meters 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 so you can see that it arrives equal or more and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 It's very simple 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.700
 that fucking grace to the wall that is in 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 the background already that night 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.490
 I have stayed more or less with the height 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.400
 of the picture and it has bounced quite well 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.760
 that now I get a good trick is this 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.730
 These paper wads good well thought out 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.730
 with many folds and then yes what 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.060
 we wet it is not going to dissolve from the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.530
 trick is to get a little wet or put 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.810
 under the tap and 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.450
 we shoot and whoever does it is going to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.180
 it hurts and it's better to chop 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.570
 a lot not too much is not a weapon that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.310
 go protect yourself but not 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.430
 shoot in the face and well in the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.540
 arms and body itself it stings pretty well 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.540
 that another
