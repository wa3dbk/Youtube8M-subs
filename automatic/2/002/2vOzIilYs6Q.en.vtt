00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 it's a mistake any style of clothing 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.159
 One has to use so now we 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.009
 begins the age of graduations and 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.290
 depending on the college you have color right 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 usually always looking for reds 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.759
 we have a model here in red 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.790

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.460
 red for the graduations which is a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.580
 V neckline which is a very nice neckline and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.440
 it has the track you put on the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630
 waist 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.550
 so he gives a finish here in the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.890
 waist which is also a very dress 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.970
 in the shop for weddings, then 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.489
 gold silver wedding I have a model 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.590

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.970
 Look at this silk taffeta dress 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.400
 pure with that loop here and the brooch of 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.250
 shine, then it 's a neat dress 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.409
 which is very nice for a wedding for a 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.269
 wedding lunch time I think it is 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.420
 one asked so does that even want to talk 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.709
 because of his color his color is a 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.239
 golden nor saw an aged man 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.489

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.019
 it serves to which time both the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.430
 day as much as the night so much for the day 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.000
 how much for us who are asking 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.900
 quite like this is the fashion and along with 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.379
 to the graduation party wear that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.819
 is asking embroidered lace fabric as 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.430
 and how do you stay? 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.590
 have this lace dress is a dress 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.760
 well classic a three quarter sleeve 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.470
 because normally 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.870
 depending on the woman's age she does not 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.459
 Do you want to show the arm again? 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.370
 detail of the income giving this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.370
 Transparency I see that it's really cool 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.129
 Good now for the wedding, we have one. 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.980
 vestibulinho embroidery also a color 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.349
 very strong flashy I see that this is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 a strong tendency is for the mother to 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.829
 godmother put color and this detail 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:20.260
 also came with great force that is the 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:23.470
 application of tule rate on embroidery 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.300
 so it's a beautiful detail and a color 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.180
 beautiful, for a mother to a godmother 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.400
 a very nice color and colors for madrid 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.320
 what do you think is ideal for a 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.700
 godmother on the altar there so much at the moment 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.680
 so important, huh? 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.680
 The bride, like cuts, I think is 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.320
 Important drawing raw and black 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.720
 any color all colors look good on 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.539
 We have this green here with 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.060
 these glittering lights I see that is 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.120
 a dress is in the musseline skirt that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.750
 a godmother for a 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.020
 mom 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.240
 this pure silk dress covers what is 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.240
 a pretty color for the godmother to 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.979
 the mother of the groom I see that also goes 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.800
 please it comes with this area that still 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.470
 also since it is still so many years there 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.450
 she still continues to see us down through the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.940
 clothes company because at the altar you 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.280
 It is covered with the arm not okay as is 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.950
 with my lap outside so I think it 's 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.039
 boring is always make up pretty clothes 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.780
 especially the party clothes on the altar 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.849
 now something else is the fulfillment of the 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.729
 clothes as she is now both the 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.260
 wedding for graduation to party 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.460
 how do you comply with the other 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.830
 we now see that they are using a 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.520
 shorter, as well as others to the 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.630
 long knee goes from taste trend mode 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.210
 How do you stay? 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.400
 I think the long has to be long 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.740
 Needs and that's what we need. 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.900
 events at lunchtime like I said 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.750
 It's a cocktail party. 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.300
 The wedding there, we can use it in the 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.250
 knee that gets lighter right 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.090
 but at graduation in long marriage 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.090
 It's always long.
