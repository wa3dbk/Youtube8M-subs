 hi there i am again today it is 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.539
 time for my jewelry stash yes like 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.009
 You know I always have a lot of jewelry 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 for him 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.300
 bijou brigitte and today we go 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 see how i put the woman on the storage already 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 a bag is awful I now have one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.700
 found a whole new way so look 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.930
 nice come well you might 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
 well think why is it now 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 actually put your stash on because 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 you may still know what's there 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 was in fact a palette and with brushes 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.170
 but this female here it doesn't fit 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 more in this section in that cupboard 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 I had to make a choice there 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.480
 just exchanged it now for this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.040
 moment palette actually better 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.450
 safe in that cupboard without them seeing 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.850
 because they sometimes fell 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.649
 once behind and now so no more is now 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 would be nice with fast and easy is one 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.480
 female of singles that I bought 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.680
 I do not super nice but actually 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.939
 more important looking or funny 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 can wind and I had a bit of a 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.329
 men needed for all those chains 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 yes guys i really have a lot 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.740
 chains and very diverse too 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 for my hummingbirds of the six 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.240
 very nice who he drops off and very 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.190
 summers and I also have a lot 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 different kinds of things 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.549
 here you see, for example, a period 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 between me and my stone supposedly that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.000
 you belong to Me 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 you can have it tested and so here we 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.390
 two pretty expensive jewelry that I have for my 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.920
 had a birthday 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.659
 one with real natural stone a bit 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280
 from qicent to the freshwater pearls 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.440
 Willem recognized and perhaps because 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.270
 I once had him go to college and then 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.430
 wanted in two pieces so I dare may 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.689
 almost no longer on the ground and it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.280
 So did not know that willemijn 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.739
 very little about it being so coarse that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.510

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.890
