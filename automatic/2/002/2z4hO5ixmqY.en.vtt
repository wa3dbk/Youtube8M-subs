you'll<00:02:13.400> also<00:02:13.610> notice<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.330> case<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.780> I'm

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you'll also notice in this case that I'm

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.660

using<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.320> dual<00:02:15.500> monitor<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.160> you'll<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.490> why

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
using a dual monitor and you'll see why

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.390 
using a dual monitor and you'll see why
in<00:02:16.700> fit<00:02:19.990> it's<00:02:20.990> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.170> ask<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
in fit it's going to ask you to just to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.710 
in fit it's going to ask you to just to
enter<00:02:22.670> your<00:02:22.820> name<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> password<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:31.720> a

enter your name and password and a
password<00:02:32.810> int<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.050> we're<00:02:39.650> finalizing<00:02:40.100> our

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
password int and so we're finalizing our

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.949 
password int and so we're finalizing our
settings<00:02:40.850> they<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.090> take<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.270> few<00:02:41.480> seconds

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
settings they just take a few seconds

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:51.140 
settings they just take a few seconds
here<00:02:41.990> I

the correction we can change the screens
around<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.050> it's<00:04:34.050> been<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.229> long<00:04:34.440> morning<00:04:34.710> here

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.110 

there<00:04:38.490> we<00:04:38.610> go

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
there we go

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.450 
there we go
so<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.900> way<00:04:40.340> apply<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.919> now<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.280> actually

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
so that way apply so now and actually

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.600 
so that way apply so now and actually
see<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.120> most<00:04:45.750> moves<00:04:45.930> back<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.380> forth<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:49.610> get

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
see the most moves back and forth so get

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.000 
see the most moves back and forth so get
back<00:04:50.789> to<00:04:50.970> our<00:04:51.030> Metro<00:04:51.360> screen<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.139> in<00:04:52.919> a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
back to our Metro screen so in a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.260 
back to our Metro screen so in a
nutshell<00:04:53.220> there<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.729> have<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.150> really

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
nutshell there you have it it really

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.520 
nutshell there you have it it really
didn't<00:04:54.570> take<00:04:54.660> as<00:04:54.810> long<00:04:54.990> as<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.200> thought<00:04:55.350> it

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
didn't take as long as I thought it

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.010 
didn't take as long as I thought it
would<00:04:55.680> but<00:04:56.490> there's<00:04:56.669> windows<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.240> go<00:04:57.389> all<00:04:57.690> set
