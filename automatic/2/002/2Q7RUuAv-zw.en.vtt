on my modern show hair wig because that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
on my modern show hair wig because that
was<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.460> week<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.059> made<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.110> didn't

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
was my first week I made and I didn't

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.090 
was my first week I made and I didn't
space<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> tracks<00:00:50.100> well<00:00:50.399> enough<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.570> I

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
space out the tracks well enough so I

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
space out the tracks well enough so I
needed<00:00:53.100> some<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.520> hair<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.030> fix<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.449> one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
needed some more hair to fix that one

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
needed some more hair to fix that one
but<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.379> turned<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.949> pretty<00:00:56.160> pretty

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but this one turned out pretty pretty

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.540 
but this one turned out pretty pretty
nice<00:00:57.059> anyway<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.739> full<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> course

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
nice anyway it's not as full of course

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
nice anyway it's not as full of course
but<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.020> still<00:01:01.230> looks<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.649> pretty

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
but I think it still looks very pretty

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.179 
but I think it still looks very pretty
this<00:01:02.640> hair<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.030> sent<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.359> via<00:01:03.480> DHL<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.739> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
this hair was sent to me via DHL and I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
this hair was sent to me via DHL and I
think<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> arrived<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.180> three<00:01:06.600> days<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
think it arrived in like three days and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.130 
think it arrived in like three days and
so<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:09.060> insert<00:01:09.750> footage

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so that was really good insert footage

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.950 
so that was really good insert footage
of<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> hair<00:01:10.920> looked<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.689> before<00:01:12.689> i

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
of what the hair looked like before i

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.620 
of what the hair looked like before i
installed<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.220> did<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> factory<00:01:15.210> smell

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
installed it it did have a factory smell

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.490 
installed it it did have a factory smell
and<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> watched<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> conditioned<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and so I watched it and conditioned it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370 
and so I watched it and conditioned it
with<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.549> some<00:01:20.759> suave<00:01:21.060> conditioner<00:01:21.750> let<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
with just some suave conditioner let it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
with just some suave conditioner let it
air<00:01:22.590> dry<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.369> few<00:01:23.610> days<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
air dry for a few days and then I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
air dry for a few days and then I
decided<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.189> today<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.909> wear<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
decided to put it on today and wear it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
decided to put it on today and wear it
out<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> first<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
out for the first time so this is a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.160 
out for the first time so this is a
initial<00:01:30.090> review<00:01:30.540> oh<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> closure<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
initial review oh the closure and the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
initial review oh the closure and the
closure<00:01:34.170> texture<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.280> hair<00:01:35.490> texture<00:01:35.909> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
closure texture and the hair texture is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.590 
closure texture and the hair texture is
definitely<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.290> same<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.310> hair<00:01:39.180> texture

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
definitely not the same the hair texture

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
definitely not the same the hair texture
of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> closure<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> tighter<00:01:40.920> curl

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
of the closure is like a tighter curl

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.510 
of the closure is like a tighter curl
and<00:01:41.640> then<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.780> texture<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.710> actual<00:01:44.250> hair

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and then the texture of the actual hair

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.710 
and then the texture of the actual hair
is<00:01:44.759> definitely<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.780> loser<00:01:46.710> wavy<00:01:47.420> texture<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
is definitely a loser wavy texture I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.090 
is definitely a loser wavy texture I
don't<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.409> guys<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
don't know if you guys can see the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
don't know if you guys can see the
difference<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.750> there's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
difference but there's there's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
difference but there's there's
definitely<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.829> difference<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> think

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
definitely a difference so I think

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450 
definitely a difference so I think
that's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.530> weird<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.280> can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's a little bit weird and I can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
that's a little bit weird and I can
probably<00:01:56.640> change<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.860> probably

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
probably change that but that's probably

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.130 
probably change that but that's probably
the<00:01:59.250> only<00:01:59.570> bad<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.280> is

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
the only bad thing that I can say is

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.660 
the only bad thing that I can say is
that<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> closure<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> actual<00:02:05.250> hair<00:02:05.520> not

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that the closure and the actual hair not

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.999
