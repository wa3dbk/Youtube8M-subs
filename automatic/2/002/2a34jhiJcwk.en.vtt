anyway so what I like to do it for us

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
anyway so what I like to do it for us
it's<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.110> map<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.590> wherever<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's just like map out wherever it is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.760 
it's just like map out wherever it is
that<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.850> other<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:52.259> good<00:01:52.619> way

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that the other is going to go a good way

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.940 
that the other is going to go a good way
to<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.079> place<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.380> stick<00:01:55.920> or

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to do it is to place a stick or

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
to do it is to place a stick or
something<00:01:56.180> like<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.810> hope

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
something like that but don't hope

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.020 
something like that but don't hope
you're<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.780> ends<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.899> eyes<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
you're out at the ends of your eyes and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
you're out at the ends of your eyes and
then<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.719> align<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> your

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
then kind of like align it to your

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.670 
then kind of like align it to your
eyebrows<00:02:05.810> like<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> end<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.380> eyebrows

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
eyebrows like the end of your eyebrows

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.100 
eyebrows like the end of your eyebrows
but<00:02:08.640> obviously<00:02:09.209> everyone<00:02:09.539> has<00:02:09.629> differently

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
but obviously everyone has differently

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
but obviously everyone has differently
shaped<00:02:10.410> eyebrows<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.459> might<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:11.879> want

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
shaped eyebrows so you might not want

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.539 
shaped eyebrows so you might not want
do<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.629> you're<00:02:12.720> totally<00:02:13.280> shorter<00:02:14.280> or

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
do that if you're totally shorter or

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.030 
do that if you're totally shorter or
longer<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:17.250> never<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.830> pretty

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
longer you never know so just pretty

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.759 
longer you never know so just pretty
much<00:02:20.159> just<00:02:20.730> try<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.959> know<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.319> angle

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
much just try to get you know that angle

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.830 
much just try to get you know that angle
where<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.159> like<00:02:23.310> slightly<00:02:23.599> following<00:02:24.599> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
where it's like slightly following the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.440 
where it's like slightly following the
curve<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.409> your<00:02:25.819> bottom<00:02:26.819> lid<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.239> guess<00:02:27.420> that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
curve of your bottom lid I guess that

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.449 
curve of your bottom lid I guess that
that<00:02:27.599> will<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> good<00:02:28.170> person<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.340> just

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
that will be a good person so I'm just

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.740 
that will be a good person so I'm just
going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> start<00:02:30.000> drawing<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.420> first

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
going to start drawing out the first

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.289 
going to start drawing out the first
line<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.610> little<00:02:35.879> line<00:02:36.120> like

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
line and it's just a little line like

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.869 
line and it's just a little line like
that<00:02:36.329> at<00:02:36.659> an<00:02:36.690> angle<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:38.400> I'm<00:02:38.519> going<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
that at an angle and then I'm going to

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.589 
that at an angle and then I'm going to
draw<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.599> line<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.079> goes<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.440> top<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.599> like

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
draw the line that goes on top and like

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:50.410 
draw the line that goes on top and like
make<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.260> go<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.489> down<00:02:44.579> like<00:02:44.910> that

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.849 

until<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> little<00:02:52.109> triangle<00:02:52.650> shape

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
until you get a little triangle shape

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.020 
until you get a little triangle shape
like<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:55.310> chattering<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.819> just

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
like that chattering that you can just

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.500 
like that chattering that you can just
go<00:02:57.150> ahead<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.420> pull<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.720> in<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:02.390> once<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
go ahead and pull it in and once you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.530 
go ahead and pull it in and once you
fill<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.519> start<00:03:05.730> drawing<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
fill it in you can start drawing the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.530 
fill it in you can start drawing the
eyeliner<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> goals<00:03:07.920> over<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.030> eye<00:03:09.060> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
eyeliner the goals over the eye and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.759 
eyeliner the goals over the eye and
basically<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.799> eyeliner<00:03:11.159> is<00:03:11.459> thick<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
basically the eyeliner is thick on the

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.319 
basically the eyeliner is thick on the
outside<00:03:13.769> corner<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.280> thinner<00:03:14.730> actually<00:03:15.150> goes

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
outside corner and thinner actually goes

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.050 
outside corner and thinner actually goes
into<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> point<00:03:16.109> word<00:03:16.340> cat<00:03:17.340> looks<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:17.700> it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
into the point word cat looks like it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.319 
into the point word cat looks like it's
gone<00:03:18.599> because<00:03:19.139> if<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.609> thick<00:03:21.000> eyeliner

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
gone because if you do thick eyeliner

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.940 
gone because if you do thick eyeliner
all<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> way<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.139> it<00:03:22.319> will<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.560> make<00:03:22.680> your

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
all the way in it will just make your

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.330 
all the way in it will just make your
eyes<00:03:23.069> look<00:03:23.099> small<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.859> kind<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.130> just

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
eyes look small so you kind of just

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.009 
eyes look small so you kind of just
curve<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:30.180> do<00:03:30.389> small<00:03:30.780> strokes

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.259 

instead<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.139> just<00:03:37.260> doing<00:03:37.349> one<00:03:38.310> straight<00:03:39.239> line

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
instead of just doing one straight line

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:51.300 
instead of just doing one straight line
because<00:03:40.310> they'll<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.549> be<00:03:42.120> harder<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.599> do

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.870 

and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:54.050> kind<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.290> wobbly<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.790> you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
and then see it's kind of wobbly so you

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.400 
and then see it's kind of wobbly so you
can<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:56.060> go<00:03:56.300> ahead<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:56.840> make<00:03:57.140> everything

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
can just go ahead and make everything

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:12.020 
can just go ahead and make everything
even

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.480
