00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.160
 but hey who goes 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.920
 welcome again this channel which 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.529
 call to speak that my name is Alberto and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 I have a very special guest, I am 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.410
 channel fan the words of youtube 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.920
 the referee's time reading and 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.290
 then the plan consists of several 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.870
 questions related to your habit of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.550
 reading then we started I think that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.200
 It is important to say that our 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.570
 t-shirts look a lot like the holidays 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.310
 came with that and remember that I have 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.949
 this one that looked like he did and the search and 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.329
 I changed 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.550
 do not 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.379
 the first question says you have some 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.379
 specific place in your house to read 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 my bed or in the room or in the kitchen 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.329
 or in the room 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.329
 me neither 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.979
 the second question and fits separately 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.050
 used separator or a piece of paper 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.050
 paper that are always few tips 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.020
 so it's not like we do not care about the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.880
 ticket or a very important paper you can 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 stop reading because I need to have you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.080
 after finishing a chapter a 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.370
 a certain number of pages like that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.370
 you can stop achieving more 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.800
 this if I can stop reading just like that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.190
 but I like to finish in a chapter I 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.190
 as well 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.090
 good if for the things that for pleasure if 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.610
 that's how I read it until the chapter 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.970
 for those of the school is as far as I 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.970
 stay 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.610
 so clear 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.610
 yes 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.410
 comerso you take something while you read sometimes 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.660
 if it is required if I have many jobs 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.330
 late and I need to eat and I have to 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 read it at the same time I do not believe with vero 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.070
 but that's why I say but for pleasure 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.130
 like sometimes if I'm taking something but 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 no to everything 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.220
 I do not the thing that is going to fall and in the 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.170
 book 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.680
 can listen to music or watch tv while 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 you read 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.310
 acoustic sometimes but I prefer our 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.100
 way for the mobile you do not get distracted 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 I know it shows is not that like that too 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.050
 I read at school if it counts in the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.760
 hallway and with people noise I prefer 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 I prefer quietly but it does not matter 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.930
 is one book at a time or several several like that 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.599
 yes because he is reading several and he starts 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.609
 a book and which are themselves normally 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.129
 four thousand in four books at a time and 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.209
 do not get confused you usually said things 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.069
 very different 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.100
 I prefer to read nothing solid at the same time 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:53.800
 but suddenly this book normally 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.940
 you read at home or anywhere in 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.070
 any place I prefer to speak in my 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.230
 house but the best place is in my 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.909
 house in the other place the library 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.189
 it's a little bit 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.610
 in the library on its own because it's 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:11.360
 very cold and I always listen to people 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.360
 so 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.440
 That 's right, but many of them are expected 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 so I prefer to read instead where 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 there is a lot of noise because it 's like that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.170
 the next initial question is you 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.980
 like to read aloud water in your mind 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.780
 we do not know high and I am alone in my 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.780
 fourth jump like this 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.510
 It is very fun and more with the encouragement in 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.800
 English because I practice a lot if by 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.450
 example was reading the books of 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.450
 French position out loud 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.260
 can be heard not to be read 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:11.180
 then it is different but yes yes yes 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:11.180
 but yes it is 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:31.170
 of the books you keep as new 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.170
 the treatment but it is mistreated 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.620
 It's not like those who do not but it's not like that 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.620
 how are there credits 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.880
 and the last question is to write in 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.070
 your books yes a lot very much there 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.140
 I have books that babies have and everything 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.380
 the margin thus annotated with a jet of 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.380
 things 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.750
 to 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.230
 before I stressed 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.520
 that you have a whole text 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.050
 usually 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.780
 I mean 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.460
 and this is over 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.600
 I'm going to put it down here 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:55.060
 I think we saw it in I must say two but 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.830
 I do not know whose original it is and I think 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.450
 that's all for study I hope that you 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.520
 have liked this video 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.200

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.440
 comment to see more ball videos that 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.770
 we have a video on the channel leave in 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.129
 her face 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:17.629
 and we have to make the tie of kisses 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:20.409
 and the author doctors were very funny 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:23.710
 and characters 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.710
 Let's see 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.150
 and ready 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.670
 I was fast it was because we were with 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.750
 the incentive to go to dinner 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.750
 Since young
