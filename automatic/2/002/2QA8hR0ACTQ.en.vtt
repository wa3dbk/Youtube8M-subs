00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.660
 of bock adventure that episode number 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.910
 6 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.559
 My business said that everyone knows 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
 I captured my beautiful art for 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.180
 here in my beyond the legend of im and today 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.400
 Can you share who he is? 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 who spoke there was that the warriors 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.840
 on YouTube you said how much I have you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.730
 is netinha another explosion connected 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.790
 no haiti destroying you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 I do not know, I 'm looking for 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.989
 some doubt because because márcio 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.470
 will also have a double and we will not make 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.780
 a two- and- a-half league championship 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.760
 and an aunt from his father and I want to test 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 You end up with games to see if he is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.050
 able enough to be my 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 agreed I think I'll have to 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.729
 test to beat the pair to boy 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.180
 you respect me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 that life is not like that the other team 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 Woe to the gifts you gave me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 I gathered from here and put it in place. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 hidden because because the people who 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.960
 are allowed here sometimes go in and get 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 so it's complicated imagine not present 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 I do not see that's boring and I got two right 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 former head of the inscribed and I am 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.710
 paying for why not so death 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.020
 will complete 75 very good and now let's 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.329
 Pokemon battle sought feel 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.920
 prepared I'm more than prepared 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 is not connected 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.609
 You're not afraid of death when she 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.789
 saw a master good and old lucky when 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.789
 huh 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.049
 I'm afraid he's young not prepared. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.609
 Here I stopped 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.240
 go then I go to the right is not the 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.729
 my place 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.320
 This is my god from heaven and then 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.270
 just kidding, right? 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:13.620
 not already on 21 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:17.820
 already amanda and ham stone rolled and now it was 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.520
 the acinte as latitude and if you look mine is 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.550
 shine the matter is mine is shine people e 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.880
 it was given by I to 20 and commerce in 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.880
 s 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 I do not only can three exchanges and the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.879
 talking day three exchanges is if you can do 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.569
 all beauty three exchanges nor rock aac 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.709
 drug brain hopefully I took a 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.739
 getting high 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.959
 Ours was very high valley in the moral not to be 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.370
 the bomb the strongest attack a man who 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.019
 happened bats 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.129
 I'm thinking of doing a first 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:59.829
 exchange is already I like I think 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.829
 it's worth exchanging some things 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:20.989
 the effect the pope follows the luck will catch 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:22.579
 someone up to now the drug and dog 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.950
 No, people just have to change, I'll change. 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.780
 an exchange already the thunder bolt was already 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:39.190
 ended up serving 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:51.950
 I'm talking here, it's no use doing 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:57.430
 clothes can not be given now 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.430
 it was the eighth game a game 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.620
 the boss is the second exchange people are 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.739
 very strong blast his people are very 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:13.819
 strong 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:16.340
 thomas'm already have this guy is serious 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.829
 is not it possible for these pokémon and there 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.849
 I do not know how to take steroids. 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.139
 It was like this when someone did not know that she 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.660
 just not yet 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.960
 I did not even see the size of the audience 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.000
 wind and many a lot of old people she 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.080
 here the atmosphere is good and I go 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.310
 give a black river attack 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.300
 It's not good, it's always our old Pedro. 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.879
 mother's arrival was now 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.810
 it was bad old problem in morals and 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:53.669
 They want me to not kill any of them. 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.159
 pokémon white ribbon in 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.729
 This is good but against me beyond here. 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.629
 third shift is that's it right there is 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.469
 Really 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:08.009
 the blizzard the strongest attack I 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:10.680
 I got from Haiti, but I did not either. 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.129

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:19.460
 asthma attack and ipi is the act attack 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:24.349
 different people do not care, there's no way 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.150
 I gained another is that it has 11 more haydon 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:30.990

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:37.889

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:43.169

 PPCAAM that antônio no no no no 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.389
 if not never but I think the phantom 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.089
 is with a Pokémon that will work 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.000
 my team because the next day he has 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:02.430

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.990
 a very strong team gave it 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.419
 Because because that's what this is, this is it. 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.120
 I have potential that matters yes 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.029

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.159

 I 'm not going to show that the 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.270

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.350

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.980

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.090
 moral penalty is attached is that if you
