00:00:03.419 --> 00:01:06.460 
of Nexus 5 and today we are going to
look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> Nova<00:00:04.230> 3<00:00:04.440> game<00:00:04.620> on<00:00:04.770> it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.350 

so<00:01:07.470> let's<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.580> running<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:09.030> good

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so let's see so it's running very good

00:01:09.360 --> 00:03:09.380 
so let's see so it's running very good
on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> Nexus<00:01:10.260> 5<00:01:10.290> new<00:01:10.770> bags<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.190> all

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.790 

so<00:03:10.390> there's<00:03:10.600> very<00:03:10.900> good<00:03:11.200> performance<00:03:11.500> by

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
so there's very good performance by

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.740 
so there's very good performance by
Nexus<00:03:12.220> violin<00:03:12.610> playing<00:03:12.850> nova<00:03:13.210> 3<00:03:13.240> him<00:03:13.630> in<00:03:13.750> it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160 

and<00:03:19.750> i<00:03:20.320> think<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:20.770> running<00:03:21.240> with<00:03:22.240> almost<00:03:22.570> 40

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and i think it's running with almost 40

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:34.790 
and i think it's running with almost 40
frames<00:03:23.680> per<00:03:24.010> second<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:25.110> Nexus<00:03:26.110> 5

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.650 

so<00:03:35.280> loading<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.880> game<00:03:36.060> takes<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.420> little

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
so loading of this game takes a little

00:03:36.660 --> 00:04:53.080 
so loading of this game takes a little
bit<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> more<00:03:37.080> time<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.440> Android<00:03:37.650> devices

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.730 

as<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.540> what<00:04:54.900> for<00:04:55.169> if<00:04:55.320> I'm<00:04:55.500> playing

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
as you know like what for if I'm playing

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.850 
as you know like what for if I'm playing
this<00:04:55.919> game<00:04:56.100> on<00:04:56.160> Nexus<00:04:56.699> 5<00:04:56.880> wanting<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.780> very<00:04:58.080> go

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.650 

and<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.040> is<00:05:02.190> what<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.460> see<00:05:02.699> optimization

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
and this is what I see optimization

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:11.689 
and this is what I see optimization
means<00:05:03.900> everything<00:05:05.300> only<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.449> this<00:05:10.520> if<00:05:11.520> you

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
means everything only like this if you

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.670 
means everything only like this if you
don't<00:05:11.940> get<00:05:12.150> optimization<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.050> games<00:05:13.320> on<00:05:13.560> your

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
don't get optimization of games on your

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.140 
don't get optimization of games on your
device<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.270> will<00:05:15.270> feel<00:05:15.479> legs<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:17.150> that

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
device you will feel legs and that
