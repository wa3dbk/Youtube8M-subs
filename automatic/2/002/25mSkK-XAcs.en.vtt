00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.370
 in this video we will see how 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.590
 manage the files we have in 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.770
 the hosting that we have hired and be able to 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.750
 connect to that server to be able to 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.730
 upload change modify or delete 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.730
 any file with ftp 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.750
 Well, first we need 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.689
 download an ftp client that as I already 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.849
 we said the last time means file 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 protocol transfer protocol 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.379
 file transfer and that's what 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.579
 it helps us to manage all the 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.760
 documents that are going to make our 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.970
 page the html trades work 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.190
 photos the videos the php files that 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.370
 that the page has then to be able 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.570
 manage them and control those that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.250
 there will be anyone who 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.460
 connect once you enter the internet 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.260
 web page as well as how to manage them 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.780
 here in this direction that already puts 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.170
 link of the video we downloaded a 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.659
 client of a little program that is for ftp 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.900
 it's called files and then we give it 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.400
 here to download 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 and while it's downloading I'm going to 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.000
 explain a little bit how we are going to do 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.190
 the connection with that team that is where 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.040
 actually files you found 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.370
 of our good page when you 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.830
 have hired the here we are going to erase 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.230
 the installer when you have 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 hired 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.220
 the hosting had to give him a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.270
 address that is the address that has 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.670
 your page 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 which is associated with an ip address that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.950
 they are a few numbers 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.080
 that are needed to access 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.120
 they also had to give him a user and 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.680
 a password that is what 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.290
 I'll need later after I've downloaded 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.110
 We will not install a file 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 then using those directions that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.590
 have given us is how we can get into 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.720
 the directory that is going to make us 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.260
 save all the documents that do 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 missing for our good page we're going to 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.310
 install 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 we reject the additional downloads 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 well the installation process as they go 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.950
 to see is very simple 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.490
 well then once it has been downloaded 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.520
 it's not going to be this window we're going to 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 move along 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.970
 in the installation I'm going to put that a 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.700
 desktop icon and directory 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.380
 installation 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.450
 and Well he commented to install 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.980
 this is very fast and we already give 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.110
 directly to what 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.989
 here we can see it here it's very good 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.000
 Well, this program is the one we're going to 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.799
 to be able to enter our page well here 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.799
 as we see we have 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:59.630
 we have 22 parts in this part we can 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.130
 control in our our team and 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 this is the part where we are going to control 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.550
 the server where we have the hosting 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.110
 where are all the two files of the 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.410
 website how do we connect here 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.590
 Well, here we have to put 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.190
 ftp point the domain name that 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.760
 you have diaz and calling yourself jairo 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.000
 located puntocom the grant to be 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.580
 the address of the website www dot 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.280
 generated has located dotcom the name of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.810
 user and password is the one that you have 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.880
 had to give when when the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.010
 against domain function 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.409
 once put 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.689
 there is connecting us well and what 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.260
 they have truth then as you can see here 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:47.799
 it has come out in the directories that 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.700
 has this this domain jairo gacitÃºa 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.459
 dotcom has those folders okay is 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.990
 the one that interests us public html let's continue 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.010
 here 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.890
 we see an index file e.html this 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.080
 file is the one that is going to open when 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.760
 someone enter here and put jairo 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.159
 located dotcom 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.450
 as it looks, it is blank because 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.120
 we have not done anything on the page if 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.829
 this file is changed what what 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.810
 here we modify is what will come out 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.270
 here in the on the website well 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.910
 then how can we change the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.410
 files to start designing our 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.220
 page so we're going to have to need 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.750
 a web development program that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.150
 will explain in the next tutorial 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.070
 what program to use to be able 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.130
 develop our page for now 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.250
 this tutorial we have seen how to 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.020
 can we access the files 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.229
 something that may be useful at the beginning is 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.680
 do the following to have a copy 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.430
 of all the directories we can if 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.430
 we copy 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.550
 all the elements that we find in 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.600
 our on our page and we copy them 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.780
 to our desk 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.780
 and so what we have is a copy in 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.430
 our own team in our team 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.920
 of all the elements that make up the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.610
 page like that because we have it 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.379
 as backup 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.379
 it will be interesting to work directly 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.150
 in our team and once already here 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.129
 we have designed how we want it to be 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.259
 the page or any configuration that 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.580
 let's do it once it's already proven 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:32.830
 in local we can upload it to the server 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.520
 where is the hosting doing the same 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.229
 the same process of dragging but in 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.349
 this occasion would be from our team 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.289
 to the server well then once 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.629
 seen this as you can see here in my 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.340
 folder that I have on the desktop 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.139
 jairo cited to point with already copied 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.810
 all server files 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.449
 Well, in the next tutorial we are going to 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.779
 see how we can develop this 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.210
 file the index put html that programita 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.590
 use for changes to be seen 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.020
 reflected in anyone who 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.939
 enter here directly on the website 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.389
 until we are not only seeing how 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.889
 prepare the work environment but in 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.960
 brief we will begin with the development 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.270
 own, I hope you liked it 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.430
 so you can share it give me

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.150
 next tutorial
