00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
working at a blank layer you're gonna

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.750 
working at a blank layer you're gonna
want<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.350> work<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.710> a<00:03:48.740> duplicate<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.550> layer

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
want to work on a duplicate of the layer

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.970 
want to work on a duplicate of the layer
that<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.000> wish<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.300> enhance<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.930> then<00:03:51.590> change

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that you wish to enhance and then change

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.250 
that you wish to enhance and then change
its<00:03:52.160> blend<00:03:52.400> mode<00:03:52.840> changing<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.900> blend<00:03:54.110> mode

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
its blend mode changing the blend mode

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.110 
its blend mode changing the blend mode
alone<00:03:54.500> lightens<00:03:55.040> or<00:03:55.190> darkens<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.760> entire

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
alone lightens or darkens the entire

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.210 
alone lightens or darkens the entire
image<00:03:56.390> but<00:03:57.020> that's<00:03:57.200> not<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.470> intended<00:03:57.920> effect

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
image but that's not the intended effect

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.980 
image but that's not the intended effect
instead<00:03:58.970> what<00:03:59.390> we<00:03:59.510> want<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.780> do<00:03:59.870> is

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
instead what we want to do is

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.800 
instead what we want to do is
selectively<00:04:00.710> apply<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:02.180> do<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:02.540> we're

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
selectively apply it to do so we're

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.900 
selectively apply it to do so we're
going<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.020> add<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.500> conceal<00:04:03.980> all<00:04:04.250> layer<00:04:04.580> mask

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
going to add a conceal all layer mask

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.370 
going to add a conceal all layer mask
basically<00:04:05.660> we're<00:04:05.810> going<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.990> fill<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.290> with

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
basically we're going to fill it with

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.110 
basically we're going to fill it with
black<00:04:06.440> when<00:04:06.860> we<00:04:06.950> create<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.490> and<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:07.790> gonna<00:04:07.880> do

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
black when we create it and I'm gonna do

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.970 
black when we create it and I'm gonna do

well<00:04:33.850> there<00:04:33.970> are<00:04:34.060> certainly<00:04:34.330> more<00:04:34.510> ways<00:04:34.750> to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
well there are certainly more ways to

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.810 
well there are certainly more ways to
add<00:04:35.050> contrast<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.830> visual<00:04:36.130> interest<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.700> an

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
add contrast and visual interest to an

add contrast and visual interest to an
image<00:04:37.090> these<00:04:37.390> methods<00:04:37.630> are<00:04:37.900> tried-and-true

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
image these methods are tried-and-true

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.530

in<00:04:38.830> my<00:04:39.010> workflow<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.090> encourage<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:40.480> to

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
in my workflow so I encourage you to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.880 
in my workflow so I encourage you to
give<00:04:40.750> them<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.900> try<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:41.500> sure<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.770> you're

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
give them a try and I'm sure that you're

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.350 
give them a try and I'm sure that you're
gonna<00:04:41.980> agree<00:04:42.280> there<00:04:42.670> aren't<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.940> lot<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.180> frills

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
gonna agree there aren't a lot of frills

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.230 
gonna agree there aren't a lot of frills
with<00:04:43.570> them<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.230> results<00:04:44.650> are<00:04:44.770> fantastic

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240
