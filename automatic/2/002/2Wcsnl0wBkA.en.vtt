00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
those then I got a good amount of I'd

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.400 
those then I got a good amount of I'd
say<00:03:41.389> about<00:03:41.419> 20<00:03:42.260> or<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.769> maybe<00:03:43.069> 50<00:03:43.669> 1<00:03:44.630> by<00:03:44.780> 4<00:03:45.139> I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
say about 20 or so maybe 50 1 by 4 I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.170

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.430 
think it's dark pink bricks and these
are<00:03:47.299> going<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.510> be<00:03:47.599> from<00:03:47.750> molding<00:03:48.169> I<00:03:48.230> thought

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
are going to be from molding I thought

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.449 
are going to be from molding I thought
it'd<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.650> interesting<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:49.130> make<00:03:49.340> some<00:03:49.549> pink

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
it'd be interesting to make some pink

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.940 
it'd be interesting to make some pink
minecraft<00:03:52.459> weapons<00:03:52.849> but<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.329> pink<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.799> can

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
minecraft weapons but in pink so you can

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
just picture that in pink that'd be

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.629 
just picture that in pink that'd be
pretty<00:03:57.470> cool<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.430> got<00:03:58.579> those<00:04:00.190> what<00:04:01.190> else<00:04:01.370> I

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
pretty cool so I got those what else I
