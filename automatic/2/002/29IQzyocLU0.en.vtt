more than once especially now that

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.120 
more than once especially now that
Cataclysm<00:00:24.930> isn't<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.529> yet<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:26.039> all

Cataclysm isn't out yet and we're all
just<00:00:26.310> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.580> waiting<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:28.820> stuff<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just kind of waiting and stuff that we

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240 
just kind of waiting and stuff that we
could<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.539> maybe<00:00:31.289> isn't<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.769> fun<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> used

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
could do maybe isn't as fun as it used

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.540 
could do maybe isn't as fun as it used
to<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.620> we've<00:00:34.620> taken<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.309> phenomenon

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to be so we've taken to this phenomenon

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.400 
to be so we've taken to this phenomenon
of<00:00:36.350> doing<00:00:37.350> laps<00:00:37.620> around<00:00:37.950> dollar<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of doing laps around dollar in so I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.880 
of doing laps around dollar in so I
thought<00:00:41.040> maybe<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:43.110> could<00:00:43.140> turn<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.680> into

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
thought maybe we could turn this into

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
thought maybe we could turn this into
something<00:00:44.190> fun<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.750> mated<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.350> idea

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
something fun and so I mated this idea

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
something fun and so I mated this idea
called<00:00:47.570> super<00:00:48.570> dollar<00:00:48.809> n<00:00:49.020> cart<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:50.480> if

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
