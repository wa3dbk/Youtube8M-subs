00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:17.021
 I am mixed race, a mix of colors oh oh 

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.526
 Oh half-breeds, I come from here and elsewhere 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.978
 Walking barefoot in the city, in sandals in the jungle 

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:33.064
 You know the mix is ​​easy, just be simple 

00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:37.804
 I am an eclipse, an unusual meeting, 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.675
 I am proud to be Métis, I have the chance to choose 

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:43.768
 Everybody ! 

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:48.022
 I am mixed race, a mix of colors oh oh 

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:52.931
 Oh half-breeds, who come from here and elsewhere 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.305
 I am mixed race, a mix of colors oh oh 

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:03.604
 Oh mestizo, I come from here and elsewhere oh oh 

00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:09.091
 If sometimes I get lost in the middle of both shores 

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:14.431
 If I need landmarks, my roots guide me 

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:19.250
 A basic feeling, a momentum, a chance 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.657
 Such a beautiful mosaic and in my heart it dances 

00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:24.700
 Disiz! 

00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:27.283
 I am living proof that all humans are the same 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.499
 I am the child of Adam and Eve I am a dream like Ishmael in Israel 

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.737
 Renounce your hatred and make the angels smile, mix the Ganges and the Thames, 

00:01:33.797 --> 00:01:37.874
 Métis from India and Brazil We are Métis like Sade, Bob Marley 

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.776
 You can laugh or bar yourself We can talk about it 

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.209
 Multicolored, anti-assards 

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.774
 and all my roommates prance for ideas of a more mixed world 

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:50.077
 A mixture of colors oh oh 

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.091
 Oh half-breed, who comes from here and elsewhere 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.386
 I am mixed race, a mix of colors oh oh 

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:04.844
 Oh half-breeds, who come from here and elsewhere oh oh 

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.376
 Two different beings who mix to make one 

00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:13.863
 I am mixed race 

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.573
 Two cultures, two past that come together to become one 

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:18.936
 I am mixed race 

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.700
 Two ways of thinking that come together to become one 

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.098
 I am mixed race 

00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.877
 No need to travel to say that I have come a long way 

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:32.376
 Stronger, stronger, it makes: 

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:37.272
 Everyone, everyone!
