you<00:02:11.260> something<00:02:11.500> though<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.980> equivalent<00:02:12.700> of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
you something though the equivalent of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.620 
you something though the equivalent of
this<00:02:13.540> cup<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> half<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:15.150> beater<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.570> to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
this cup and a half of a beater so to

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.080 
this cup and a half of a beater so to
speak<00:02:17.100> wouldn't<00:02:18.100> be<00:02:18.190> two<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> half<00:02:18.790> eggs

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
speak wouldn't be two and a half eggs

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.000 
speak wouldn't be two and a half eggs
now<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.750> had<00:02:19.959> broke<00:02:20.170> two<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> half<00:02:20.709> eggs

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
now if I had broke two and a half eggs

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.470 
now if I had broke two and a half eggs
into<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> glass<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.820> would<00:02:21.940> probably<00:02:22.150> come

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
into this glass it would probably come

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.150 
into this glass it would probably come
to<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:23.100> so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to here so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.770 
to here so
there's<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> lot<00:02:25.760> less<00:02:25.970> calories<00:02:26.240> because

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
there's a lot less calories because

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.150 
there's a lot less calories because
there's<00:02:26.960> less<00:02:27.080> fat<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.620> guess<00:02:27.830> less

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
there's less fat I guess less

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.010 
there's less fat I guess less

retrospect<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.830> were<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.430> would<00:03:20.330> put<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
retrospect I were you I would put the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.470 
retrospect I were you I would put the
basil<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> powder<00:03:21.590> garlic<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.420> after<00:03:23.420> you

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
basil and the powder garlic in after you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.120 
basil and the powder garlic in after you
put<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.750> vegetables<00:03:23.960> before<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.740> put<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
put the vegetables before you put the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820 
put the vegetables before you put the
egg<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.870> think<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:26.990> it's<00:03:27.200> sitting<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.560> top

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
egg I think because it's sitting on top

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.630 
egg I think because it's sitting on top
now<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.970> okay<00:03:29.650> now<00:03:30.650> i<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> quarter<00:03:31.430> cup

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
now that's okay now i have a quarter cup

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.410 
now that's okay now i have a quarter cup
of<00:03:31.880> fat-free<00:03:33.340> craft<00:03:34.420> shredded<00:03:35.420> mozzarella

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
of fat-free craft shredded mozzarella

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.380 
of fat-free craft shredded mozzarella
also<00:03:38.420> want<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.810> that

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.480 

like<00:03:44.990> I<00:03:45.170> said<00:03:45.230> whole<00:03:45.830> thing<00:03:46.069> will<00:03:46.220> have<00:03:46.340> about

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
like I said whole thing will have about

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.610 
like I said whole thing will have about
70<00:03:47.060> calories<00:03:47.270> each<00:03:47.750> when<00:03:47.930> we<00:03:48.080> divide<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.500> in

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
70 calories each when we divide it in

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.620 
70 calories each when we divide it in
for<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.160> about<00:03:49.600> 280<00:03:50.600> calories<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.410> whole

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
for so about 280 calories for the whole

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.000 
for so about 280 calories for the whole
280<00:03:53.630> calories<00:03:53.840> for<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.319> whole<00:03:54.500> thing<00:03:54.709> isn't

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
280 calories for this whole thing isn't

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.199 
280 calories for this whole thing isn't
that<00:03:55.130> what<00:03:55.280> someone<00:03:55.490> does<00:03:55.580> lean<00:03:55.790> cuisine

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
that what someone does lean cuisine

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.740 
that what someone does lean cuisine
meals<00:03:56.480> are<00:03:56.720> 280<00:03:57.290> calories<00:03:57.880> matching<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.060> ok

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
meals are 280 calories matching that ok

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.810 
meals are 280 calories matching that ok
so<00:04:00.020> that's<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.440> not<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:00.920> lot<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.250> hard<00:04:01.430> work<00:04:01.490> for

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
so that's it not a lot of hard work for

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.970 
so that's it not a lot of hard work for
this<00:04:01.850> one<00:04:02.260> you're<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.410> bake<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.860> I
