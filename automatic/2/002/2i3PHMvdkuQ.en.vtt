00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.470
 very good kids welcome to heart 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.660
 to player dotcom today we are going to see one 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.050
 of the latest releases of nvidia it 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.029
 it's about the new gtx 650 tybus and let's go 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.980
 to see how this graphics card of less 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.970
 of 200 euros moves the last games 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.010
 generation the gtx 650 tybus is a 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.920
 graphic card that has gigas 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.809
 of gddr5 memory and with some of the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.910
 characteristics and specifications of 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.800
 the high performance cards between 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.650
 them the kepler architecture and the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.540
 gpu boost technology also supports the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.079
 latest nvidia technology as you can 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.370
 be direct 11-s lay physics on video 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.039
 television among others 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 Well, here we have the card from 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 here you can see perfectly the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
 fan and everything is covered in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.780
 black plastic to improve the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.180
 ventilation in the lower part we see 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 the pci express 3.0 connection 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.870
 and at the top we see the connector 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 for that lay and the connector 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.360
 6-pin power in the part 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.590
 superior we see that busy in the fish 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.460
 we see the holes for ventilation 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 a port display port a hdmi and two 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.390
 ports for dv 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 Well, since we've seen a bit 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.130
 graphs on the outside and some of their 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.630
 data now let's really see what 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.759
 we are interested in how it moves 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 games now let's start by battle 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.689
 filtres right now you are seeing it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.939
 the frob here in the upper corner 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.799
 left right now is in the 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.189
 configuration of graphics in ultra and 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.549
 you see that it stays around 38 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.399
 45 fps which is quite fluid as 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.020
 not see any jerk paste moment there 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.200
 to say that in the pc that we are 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.210
 playing on a core i7 3 16 gb of memory 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.390
 ram and a hard drive ssd 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 well now let's see we keep it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.569
 around the 39 38 40 we are going to change 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.480
 the configuration on high to see what 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.610
 improve as you see the difference then 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440
 quite noticeable since nothing nothing 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 change the jump and we are already kept 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.569
 around 60 fps or so 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.030
 stable and certainly would be the option 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.800
 ideal to play online since in ultra 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.360
 well we could play here without any 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.489
 problem but no doubt in the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 high graphical configuration will not go 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.129
 much more fluid 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
 good after seeing as new from the fil 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.299
 3 now we are testing in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 for speed most wanted and we see that it 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.610
 stable at 60 fps as you do see 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.159
 what does even a collision do not 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 there is usually no frame drop if 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.330
 let's go to the graphical adjustments 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.670
 we see that most of the options 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.520
 graphs are high except some that 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.070
 another detail such as environmental inclusion 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.050
 and geometry detail that are in 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.300
 medium but good still we can play 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.700
 almost fluidly with the graphics to the fullest 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.060
 around 60 frames per 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.150
 second 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.730
 as we have said before the gtx 650 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.650
 activus makes use of nvidia physics 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.930
 and a good example of this is what 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.270
 we are seeing borderlands 2 currently 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.520
 is happening around 60 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.209
 frames per second stable and if 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.209
 let's go to the options menu 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.840
 we see that both the graphic adjustments 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.269
 as the physical adjustments we have it 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.310
 everything to the maximum except some filter that 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.379
 another but good basically addressing the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.319
 two we can play almost everything in ultra 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.879
 still with a fluency of 60 frames per 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.310
 second 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.500
 well can you express that the gtx 650 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.780
 tybus is a graphics card that barely 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.640
 comes to 200 euros we have already seen that 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.129
 moves the last games 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.799
 generation also has the latest in 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.510
 technologies like the 11 strip and the use 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.549
 of physics as we have seen in porter 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.769
 I do not recommend, I recommend 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.900
 download and install nvidia geforce 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.030
 experience since we optimize everyone 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 pc games with just one click on 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.720
 base to the hardware of our pc 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.069
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.069
 video and see you next
