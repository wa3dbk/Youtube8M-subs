the years and it's going to hold true to
what<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.110> important

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
what it is I don't think it's important

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.140 
what it is I don't think it's important
I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.979> depends<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.340> who's<00:01:20.549> tattooing<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
I think it depends on who's tattooing it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
I think it depends on who's tattooing it
not<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> tattoo<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> everybody<00:01:22.799> tattoos

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
not what the tattoo is everybody tattoos

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
not what the tattoo is everybody tattoos

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.920 
think everything most of the things you
tap<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.009> need<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.729> type<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:38.970> outline<00:01:39.570> maybe

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
tap to need some type of outline maybe

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
tap to need some type of outline maybe
it's<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> thick<00:01:41.009> outline<00:01:41.430> maybe<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's not like a thick outline maybe it's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's not like a thick outline maybe it's
a<00:01:42.090> light<00:01:42.840> outline<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:44.189> outlines<00:01:44.610> in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a light outline but you need outlines in

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480 
a light outline but you need outlines in
a<00:01:44.909> tattoo<00:01:45.299> over<00:01:45.509> time<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> tattoos

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
a tattoo over time a lot of the tattoos

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.700 
a tattoo over time a lot of the tattoos
with<00:01:47.700> no<00:01:47.880> outline<00:01:48.329> end<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.990> looking<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
with no outline end up looking like and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
with no outline end up looking like and
that's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> truth<00:01:50.670> there's<00:01:51.420> great<00:01:51.840> artists

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that's the truth there's great artists

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
that's the truth there's great artists
out<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.829> they'll<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.130> stuff<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.579> no

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
out there and they'll do stuff with no

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850 
out there and they'll do stuff with no
outline<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> two<00:01:55.049> tiers<00:01:55.320> later<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
outline you see it two tiers later and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.609 
outline you see it two tiers later and
it's<00:01:56.119> gone<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.509> yeah<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> definitely<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it's gone you know yeah I definitely a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.290 
it's gone you know yeah I definitely a
lot<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.860> line

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
lot of line

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.100 
lot of line
I<00:02:00.580> but<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> same<00:02:02.030> thing<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.480> I<00:02:02.600> usually<00:02:02.750> wear<00:02:03.080> I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
I but a same thing like I usually wear I

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.170 
I but a same thing like I usually wear I
think<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:03.740> necessary<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.580> create<00:02:04.910> like

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
think it's necessary to like create like

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.570 
think it's necessary to like create like
that<00:02:05.330> sharp<00:02:05.630> edge<00:02:05.780> or<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:07.010> focal<00:02:07.370> point

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
that sharp edge or like that focal point

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.640 
that sharp edge or like that focal point
on<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> piece<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.300> just<00:02:08.510> to<00:02:08.630> like<00:02:08.840> going

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.650 
on the piece but just to like going

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.810 
on the piece but just to like going
through<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.160> hard<00:02:10.430> outline

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
through it just to hard outline

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.400 
through it just to hard outline
throughout<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> whole<00:02:11.450> area<00:02:11.930> just<00:02:12.260> because

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
throughout the whole area just because

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.730 
throughout the whole area just because
like<00:02:12.860> somebody<00:02:13.760> says<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.410> don't<00:02:15.410> really<00:02:15.470> see

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
like somebody says so I don't really see

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.410 
like somebody says so I don't really see
any<00:02:15.860> lines<00:02:16.070> in<00:02:16.250> your<00:02:16.400> face<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.030> I'll<00:02:17.390> use

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
any lines in your face you know I'll use

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.900 
any lines in your face you know I'll use
things<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:17.990> accent<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.040> eyes<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
things like accent the eyes and it like

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.300 
things like accent the eyes and it like
in<00:02:20.060> certain<00:02:20.210> areas<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.040> everything<00:02:22.040> else<00:02:22.190> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
in certain areas but everything else is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.150 
in certain areas but everything else is
shading<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.790> think<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> same<00:02:24.650> it's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
shading I think it's all the same it's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.700 
shading I think it's all the same it's
equal<00:02:25.520> outline<00:02:26.210> or<00:02:26.450> not<00:02:26.600> outline<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.470> just

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
equal outline or not outline it's just

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.960 
equal outline or not outline it's just
you<00:02:28.070> got<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.460> right<00:02:28.550> contrast

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
you got to have the right contrast

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.600 
you got to have the right contrast
levels<00:02:29.360> reality<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.380> best<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.830> them<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.340> put

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
levels reality the best of them they put

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.490 
levels reality the best of them they put
an<00:02:31.730> outline<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:32.870> they<00:02:33.020> they

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
an outline in there but then they they

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.350 
an outline in there but then they they
cover<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:33.980> with<00:02:34.160> some<00:02:34.370> black<00:02:34.550> shading<00:02:34.940> or<00:02:35.210> they

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
cover it with some black shading or they

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210 
cover it with some black shading or they
shade<00:02:35.630> off<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.380> don't<00:02:36.560> see<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.010> but

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
shade off of it so you don't see it but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.220 
shade off of it so you don't see it but
