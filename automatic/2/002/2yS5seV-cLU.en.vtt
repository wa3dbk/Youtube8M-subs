00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
end it's going to end slightly

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.520 
end it's going to end slightly
differently<00:06:00.860> it's<00:06:01.010> going<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.190> like<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:05.530> then

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
differently it's going to like this then

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.600 
differently it's going to like this then

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
you're going to go five three and then

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.960 
you're going to go five three and then
right<00:06:19.010> after<00:06:19.100> three<00:06:19.400> you're<00:06:19.520> going<00:06:19.640> to<00:06:19.700> end<00:06:19.850> it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970
