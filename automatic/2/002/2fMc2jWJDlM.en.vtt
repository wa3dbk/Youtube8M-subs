00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.879
 Peru has proposed that the new agenda 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.510
 sustainable development for the 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.510
 the post-2015 scenario is oriented 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.350
 in this direction because we do not pretend 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:21.330
 talk about development if it is not 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.260
 is for all we will follow therefore 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.380
 encouraging and participating in a way 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.050
 proactive in negotiations for the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.539
 establishment of a new agenda 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.399
 global sustainable development 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.950
 inclusive for the post 2015 scenario in 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.380
 this sense we have assumed the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.610
 Responsibility to host 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.530
 to the twentieth conference of the parties 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 of the nations framework convention 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.769
 united on climate change cop 20 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.800
 what implies from now an effort 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.260
 preparatory very intense both in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.090
 organizational matter as in what is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.950
 refers to negotiation management 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.860
 organization monitoring of agreements 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.289
 that are being configured in different 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020
 levels to be able to establish in a 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:20.090
 near future that we hope will be in the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 2015 in addition a new regime 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 international for climate change 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.230
 it is necessary to act so that they assume 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.120
 concrete global commitments regarding 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.080
 to the need to mitigate emissions 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.220
 pollutants but above all 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 especially in the case of our 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.610
 real region and perform urgent tasks 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 of adaptation what is what it requires 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.930
 in turn specify the offers 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.250
 dice to channel resources 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 knowledge and technology on behalf of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.860
 industrialized world towards the countries 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.950
 We are vulnerable in this effort 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.160
 for reaching equitable agreements and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.160
 universal on these matters with the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 decisive and committed support of all the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.410
 region the solution is to analyze the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.709
 problem not from a limited perspective 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.040
 from a sectoral perspective but from 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.519
 a global perspective 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.280
 Peru is aware of the nefarious 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.590
 effects of climate change and is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.109
 in solidarity with the people who suffer 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.810
 this situation so he will strive 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.620
 in working with them in the framework of 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.620
