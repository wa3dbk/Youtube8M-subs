very<00:05:21.840> much<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.350> line<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:23.130> our<00:05:23.490> existing<00:05:24.450> sort

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
very much in line with our existing sort

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.270 
very much in line with our existing sort
of<00:05:24.870> idea<00:05:25.290> that<00:05:25.380> we're<00:05:25.710> trying<00:05:25.890> to<00:05:26.070> get<00:05:26.160> out

of idea that we're trying to get out
there<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.930> think<00:05:28.169> it<00:05:28.260> would<00:05:28.410> be<00:05:28.620> effective

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
there and I think it would be effective

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.260 
there and I think it would be effective
effectiveness<00:05:30.240> wise<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:32.040> think<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.669> like<00:05:33.180> I

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
effectiveness wise I think it like I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.480 
effectiveness wise I think it like I
said<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:33.660> it's<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.410> line<00:05:34.650> with<00:05:34.919> what<00:05:35.100> we<00:05:35.130> are

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
said it's it's in line with what we are

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.460 
said it's it's in line with what we are
already<00:05:35.700> doing<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.510> hopefully<00:05:36.750> work<00:05:37.200> what

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
already doing so hopefully work what

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.580 
already doing so hopefully work what
we're<00:05:37.620> doing<00:05:37.860> is<00:05:37.980> already<00:05:38.400> effective<00:05:39.590> doable

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
we're doing is already effective doable

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.890 
we're doing is already effective doable
very<00:05:41.390> very<00:05:42.390> doable<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:43.680> then<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:45.210> hook<00:05:45.480> I

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
very very doable and then the hook I

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.260 
very very doable and then the hook I
could<00:05:46.260> definitely<00:05:46.530> see<00:05:46.980> this<00:05:47.610> catching<00:05:48.150> on

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
could definitely see this catching on

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.159 
could definitely see this catching on
and<00:05:48.419> hopefully<00:05:48.990> being<00:05:49.260> forward<00:05:49.980> worthy<00:05:50.310> right

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
and hopefully being forward worthy right

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.830 
and hopefully being forward worthy right
