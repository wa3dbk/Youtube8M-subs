00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.000
 Hello everyone and psychomotor 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.189
 people following with the previous video 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.039
 of the maps of the future we were 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.020
 commenting on what this ray could be 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.000
 what was on top of what would be the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.910
 electric tower of trÃ nsit that would be 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.010
 this image that we see here because it is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.500
 the ray is above I was thinking of a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.140
 principle as I told you that ray 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.140
 belonged to this tower was the same 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.390
 drawing but seeing that the drawing here 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.469
 of what is the water and the fin of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 shark is above that ray that 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.920
 electric beam could be perfectly 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.900
 consequence of what happened in transit 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.910
 when we connect all the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.480
 ships making all 63 on the maps 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.750
 in buried the transit and in day race 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.030
 we had to connect all the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.210
 towers not all electric towers 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.280
 all the energy of the electrical towers 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.140
 then when we connect the snap card 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.080
 already they were connected between them all between 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.860
 yes then that energy needed her 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.170
 maximum 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.680
 that energy is very important for a 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.800
 future and already have left prepared in 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.770
 that end in that interest when we have 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.200
 everything in buried all connected and the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.560
 last connected nap card that is the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.350
 buried in transit then that sounds 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.820
 sound that kind of radio rap 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.340
 that kind of communication radio and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.620
 something will happen in the future then I 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.720
 I think this ray here is this the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 electricity sign 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 this century is going to be very important in the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 future and I think this symbol will be 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.440
 consequence of what we did in 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.210
 transit and that's why it would be right on top 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.430
 of this that would be the symbol of transit 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 this would be my thought of why 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.730
 this is the symbol of electricity and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.460
 keep in mind that maxis wanted 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.610
 store all that electricity and could 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.210
 use that way that way 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 heart with the great energy accumulated in 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.580
 the ionosphere 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.790
 that energy could use it for 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 put it in connection directly with the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.090
 pyramid 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.640
 and thus be able to carry out their plans 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.110
 So much this map of the water as I told you 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 yesterday like this that would be the one of the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.030
 electricity we will see in a future 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.850
 who knows how much is left for that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.330
 but we will wait without patients 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.569
 much remains to be resolved from this wall 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.560
 Much remains to be discovered 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:11.069
 and little by little we will go 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.470
 to that end although I think that still 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.500
 there are so many 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.480
 the time that she wants to give the ex 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.480
 subscribe and until the next video
