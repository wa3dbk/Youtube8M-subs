 brothers and sisters as well as brothers e 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.509
 sisters madame and monsieur and more 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 has more put it vidal perosa descend 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.809
 first light of evening returns usable 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 will has never split ends are 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.870
 again with us we go is Chinese 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.930
 I don't know it is commanded to be Beijing 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:24.029
 postaccio, however, are the tastes of us 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 week yes no 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 work, however, violence supercup I 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 I suppose you mainly count for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 as the surrender and not in the sense of 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 policies of all that of the center 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 after the door to the plays are born 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 always when in the garment that the most thing 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 important then the episodes but the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.640
 difference but made them also in Rome 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.710
 you hear I ask you a question as well as from 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 man willing to journalist always on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.480
 I also am a human being piece 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.480
 made four days in london i saw 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.039
 hallucinating stuff, I mean, I don't know 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.360
 of US that all pay bolt 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.760
 who was a competitor Jamaican but the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.500
 stronger competition Cammarelle embrace 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 the opponent finished also on the side 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.690
 half but how is it that in our football we 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.369
 we are so if not because we are so of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 low level because we do controversy 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.470
 where it does not exist at the bottom because there 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.049
 controversy amuses why not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.850
 we know how to do without it because I am the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.320
 best way to normalize 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.729
 at least in public the causes of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.409
 defeat because, for example, we would need to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.180
 ask yourself about the replacements I have 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.350
 made mazzarri and micro and has none 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.509
 nobody spoke 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.880
 in the end the controversy shifts the goal 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.610
 from a thing that bothers and therefore is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.350
 the most comfortable way if we want also 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 if obviously the one most present in the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.710
 the new oriental market the juventus 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.079
 great success but there is also a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.450
 very famous Italian singer yes I think 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.729
 that tiziano iron here where they remain also 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.060
 low the music they are doing 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.220
 double deck feel to the basic product 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 controversy today eca controversy with zeman 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 in zeman's career it is only one outlet 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.010
 a joke that raged about 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.620
 Juve fans forum 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.170
 john elkann shooting his faithful made 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.810
 his and I must say that it was inevitable 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.600
 because lately the zeman attacks 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.090
 they are weekly now so let's do it 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.670
 the point has passed mid-August today 16 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.360
 naples disaster cannot be done with the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.440
 juve that if the atmosphere is Rome as well 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.390
 we have yet to start sampling a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.030
 only begins the championship 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.980
 the atmosphere a bit over the top too 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 that you should not try to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.390
 tone down and focus on 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
 what happens in the field and for juve 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.780
 until now in the last period always 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.010
 have been good news great midfield 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.720
 isla that has not yet done his 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.370
 entrance for luck in a while arrives 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.780
 pogba that showed up for a 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.150
 young but with great promises to the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.160
 I would say juve always misses the attacker 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.450
 yes we don't mark america you know if 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 we call yes numerically missing 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.360
 certainly in terms of quality too 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.670
 that is, a flourishing man is an area man 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.310
 goleador however does not make you make a leap of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.480
 quality at least this is the hypothesis 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 current starting base from which 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880
 we can make a comment 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.580
 I saw that you asked al 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.350
 president I am thrilled but 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.420
 president adriana blandly la 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.820
 answer is clear that there is to say that the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.040
 juve is confronted with real ones 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.500
 corporate squadrons to the point of view 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.269
 economic because open example would be 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.160
 1, however, also well the juve the manchester 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.019
 united pulled out 30 million for the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.610
 more tag than all those from him 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 are figures that no Italian school 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.150
 including the juve can afford to 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.250
 pour and almost was born question that done 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.300
 like this and almost like a fight you learn clouds 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.519
 entirely because then you can also 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.870
 spend badly as told by raids 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.480
 but at the start 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.400
 there is little to do then in the end 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.030
 flicking through the daisy they are paraded 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.780
 off all the petals who remains remains 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
 llorente 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.299
 i heart remains core s though i think that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.040
 may there be also because the other one 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.290
 surprise let's see what comes 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.090
 so two weeks is true as he said 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.590
 also generic because already last year 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.510
 and even more so that this year the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.099
 collective will be the weapon of the juve that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.989
 anyway to buffon and pay him two 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.150
 world-class champions therefore 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.099
 on those with perfect taxes and up 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.900
 these notes greet you as we are 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.190
 Italians do not ask you who this is 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.049
 because it is not an Italian group not 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.959
 we can love you italian spa and we are 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.910
 Italians proud to be gb 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.370
 appointment to the berlusconi and see you 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.829
 Sunday night obviously help for 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.480
 lose if the quarry tells coresa thing 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.250
 so let's wait for a game 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.650
 absolutely false 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.389
 in which milan will perhaps manage to win 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.190
 Juve will try to lose direction 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.270
 I remember a decisive Ferrara penalty 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.370
 who then put his hands in his hair 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.020
 aware of the misfortune that it would be 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.820
 happened after winning berlusconi is 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.560
 hidden dincer milan 2 to 1 and yes because 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.660
 we are absolutely not superstitious 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.160
 we are Italian, rip off the superstitious e 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.160
 then saints navigating in the sun
