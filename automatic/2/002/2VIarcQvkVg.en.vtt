00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
our farm because we have been looking at

our farm because we have been looking at
it<00:00:24.640> for<00:00:24.670> quite<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.029> while<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.599> when<00:00:25.900> you<00:00:25.960> think

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
about it as you roll across a field the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.480 
about it as you roll across a field the
soil<00:00:29.230> is<00:00:29.439> different<00:00:29.830> you're<00:00:29.949> gonna<00:00:30.039> go<00:00:30.279> over

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
soil is different you're gonna go over

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.190 
soil is different you're gonna go over
some<00:00:30.640> hills<00:00:31.089> and<00:00:31.420> you<00:00:31.480> may<00:00:31.599> have<00:00:31.720> some<00:00:31.900> clay

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
some hills and you may have some clay

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.840 
some hills and you may have some clay
hills<00:00:32.500> or<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:32.800> may<00:00:32.920> have<00:00:33.010> some<00:00:33.190> sandy<00:00:33.640> Hills

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.760 
hills or you may have some sandy Hills
you<00:00:34.180> get<00:00:34.329> into<00:00:34.540> some<00:00:34.690> lower<00:00:34.899> ground<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.590> it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
you get into some lower ground and it

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.380 
you get into some lower ground and it
may<00:00:35.890> be<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:36.040> little<00:00:36.309> heavier<00:00:36.579> ground<00:00:36.969> it's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
may be a little heavier ground it's

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.029 
may be a little heavier ground it's
different<00:00:38.050> out<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.469> in<00:00:38.559> different<00:00:38.829> parts

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
different out there in different parts

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.229 
different out there in different parts
of<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.219> field<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.730> if<00:00:39.850> you're<00:00:40.000> going<00:00:40.149> to

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
of the field and if you're going to

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.000 
of the field and if you're going to
plant<00:00:40.570> all<00:00:40.840> those<00:00:41.110> parts<00:00:41.469> of<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.590> field<00:00:41.770> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
plant all those parts of the field the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.250 
plant all those parts of the field the
same<00:00:42.039> and<00:00:42.550> treat<00:00:42.850> them<00:00:43.030> all<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.270> same<00:00:43.629> when

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
same and treat them all the same when

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.049 
same and treat them all the same when
the<00:00:44.350> soils<00:00:44.680> are<00:00:44.800> completely<00:00:45.250> different<00:00:45.399> it

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
the soils are completely different it

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.459 
the soils are completely different it
doesn't<00:00:46.270> make<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> whole<00:00:46.690> lot<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:46.899> sense<00:00:47.140> so

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense so

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.560 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense so
variable<00:00:47.890> rate<00:00:48.039> seeding<00:00:48.430> does<00:00:48.699> seem<00:00:48.969> like<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
variable rate seeding does seem like the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.869 
variable rate seeding does seem like the
way<00:00:49.719> to<00:00:49.750> go<00:00:49.870> yes<00:00:50.469> but<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.070> still<00:00:51.309> comes<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:51.609> to

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
way to go yes but it still comes down to

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.150 
way to go yes but it still comes down to
economics<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.660> quite<00:00:53.289> frankly<00:00:53.500> when<00:00:53.890> corn

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
economics and quite frankly when corn

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.860 
economics and quite frankly when corn
was<00:00:54.309> worth<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.550> dollar<00:00:54.730> 50<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.449> we<00:00:55.660> were<00:00:55.750> only

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
was worth a dollar 50 and we were only

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.099 
was worth a dollar 50 and we were only
getting<00:00:56.320> 130<00:00:57.070> 150<00:00:58.030> bushel<00:00:58.359> yields<00:00:58.750> there<00:00:58.899> just

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
getting 130 150 bushel yields there just

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.020 
getting 130 150 bushel yields there just
weren't<00:00:59.260> enough<00:00:59.530> dollars<00:00:59.829> there<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:00.940> to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
weren't enough dollars there for it to

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.819 
weren't enough dollars there for it to
be<00:01:01.149> worth<00:01:01.359> messing<00:01:01.870> with<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:02.559> always

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
be worth messing with and what we always

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.920 
be worth messing with and what we always
thought<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.399> well<00:01:03.760> do<00:01:04.120> we<00:01:04.240> really<00:01:04.480> even<00:01:04.570> know

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
thought is well do we really even know

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.420 
thought is well do we really even know
what<00:01:04.960> next<00:01:05.350> year<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.560> gonna<00:01:05.680> bring<00:01:05.980> because

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
what next year is gonna bring because

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.180 
what next year is gonna bring because
let's<00:01:06.670> say<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.060> plant<00:01:07.620> 30,000<00:01:08.620> corn

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
let's say that I plant 30,000 corn

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.390 
let's say that I plant 30,000 corn
plants<00:01:09.700> per<00:01:09.880> acre<00:01:09.910> that<00:01:10.690> might<00:01:10.960> be<00:01:11.200> more<00:01:12.010> than

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
plants per acre that might be more than

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.970 
plants per acre that might be more than
what<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:12.970> want<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.540> sandy<00:01:13.990> soil<00:01:14.260> but<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.830> might

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
what we want in sandy soil but it might

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.160 
what we want in sandy soil but it might
not<00:01:15.010> be<00:01:15.190> quite<00:01:15.610> as<00:01:15.850> much<00:01:16.030> as<00:01:16.390> what<00:01:16.540> we<00:01:16.660> want<00:01:16.870> in

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
not be quite as much as what we want in

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.830 
not be quite as much as what we want in
real<00:01:17.530> heavy<00:01:17.860> good<00:01:18.610> soil<00:01:19.090> highly<00:01:19.600> fertile

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
real heavy good soil highly fertile

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.810 
real heavy good soil highly fertile
ground<00:01:20.260> but<00:01:20.680> do<00:01:21.160> we<00:01:21.340> know<00:01:21.460> what<00:01:21.610> we're<00:01:21.730> gonna

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
ground but do we know what we're gonna

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.610 
ground but do we know what we're gonna
get<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.180> rainfall<00:01:22.360> we<00:01:22.750> might<00:01:22.900> get<00:01:23.080> 30<00:01:23.320> inches

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
get for rainfall we might get 30 inches

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.350 
get for rainfall we might get 30 inches
of<00:01:23.680> rain<00:01:23.890> we<00:01:24.100> might<00:01:24.280> get<00:01:24.430> 15<00:01:24.850> inches<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.210> rain

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
of rain we might get 15 inches of rain

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.240 
of rain we might get 15 inches of rain
so<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.110> made<00:01:26.410> a<00:01:26.440> whole<00:01:26.650> lot<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.860> difference

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
so that made a whole lot of difference

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.560 
so that made a whole lot of difference
so<00:01:27.400> we<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.790> kind<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.000> looked<00:01:28.180> at<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.330> as

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
so we just kind of looked at it as

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.710 
so we just kind of looked at it as
that's<00:01:29.470> our<00:01:29.830> way<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.190> basically<00:01:30.940> hedge<00:01:31.390> our

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that's our way to basically hedge our

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.570 
that's our way to basically hedge our
risk<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:35.200> but<00:01:35.560> seriously<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.130> mean<00:01:36.400> the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
risk so but but seriously I mean the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.030 
risk so but but seriously I mean the
economics<00:01:37.420> play<00:01:37.720> such<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:37.990> huge<00:01:38.140> role<00:01:38.980> in

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
economics play such a huge role in

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.130 
economics play such a huge role in
farming<00:01:39.820> you've<00:01:40.240> got<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.600> take<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> look<00:01:41.020> at

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
farming you've got to take a look at

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.430 
farming you've got to take a look at
that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.960 
that
well<00:01:41.560> now<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.800> commodity<00:01:42.250> prices<00:01:42.880> are

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
well now that commodity prices are

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.910 
well now that commodity prices are
higher<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.480> we're<00:01:43.840> getting<00:01:44.110> higher<00:01:44.290> yields

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
higher and we're getting higher yields

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.010 
higher and we're getting higher yields
you<00:01:45.280> know<00:01:45.400> now<00:01:45.610> we<00:01:45.670> want<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.570> manage<00:01:46.720> things

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you know now we want to manage things

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.150 
you know now we want to manage things
just<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.380> little<00:01:47.410> bit<00:01:47.650> differently<00:01:48.070> and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
just a little bit differently and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160 
just a little bit differently and
actually<00:01:49.090> manage<00:01:49.390> them<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.570> little<00:01:49.810> better<00:01:49.900> I

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
actually manage them a little better I

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.170 
actually manage them a little better I
know<00:01:50.410> for<00:01:50.590> some<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.890> us<00:01:51.010> we<00:01:51.400> can<00:01:51.700> manage<00:01:51.910> things

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
know for some of us we can manage things

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.490 
know for some of us we can manage things
better<00:01:52.330> than<00:01:52.690> others<00:01:52.930> if<00:01:53.080> you've<00:01:53.230> got

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
better than others if you've got

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.810 
better than others if you've got
irrigation<00:01:54.160> on<00:01:54.280> your<00:01:54.400> ground<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.700> know

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
irrigation on your ground you know

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.280 
irrigation on your ground you know
exactly<00:01:55.210> how<00:01:55.360> much<00:01:55.480> water<00:01:55.690> you're<00:01:55.960> gonna<00:01:56.050> get

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
exactly how much water you're gonna get

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.810 
exactly how much water you're gonna get
you<00:01:56.590> can<00:01:56.740> play<00:01:56.920> around<00:01:57.040> with<00:01:57.220> your<00:01:57.430> rates<00:01:57.610> on

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
you can play around with your rates on

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340 
you can play around with your rates on
planting<00:01:58.270> quite<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> bit<00:01:58.750> because<00:01:58.900> if<00:01:59.200> you've

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
planting quite a bit because if you've

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.110 
planting quite a bit because if you've
got<00:01:59.380> some<00:01:59.740> variants<00:02:00.190> out<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.550> field<00:02:00.790> you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
got some variants out in that field you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.060 
got some variants out in that field you
can<00:02:01.300> fine<00:02:01.570> tune<00:02:01.600> your<00:02:01.930> program<00:02:02.560> with<00:02:02.770> variable

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
can fine tune your program with variable

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.830 
can fine tune your program with variable
rate<00:02:03.250> seeding<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:03.970> you've<00:02:04.060> got<00:02:04.180> exactly<00:02:04.720> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
rate seeding so you've got exactly the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.540 
rate seeding so you've got exactly the
right<00:02:04.960> amount<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.290> plants<00:02:05.650> out<00:02:05.770> there<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:06.370> take

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
right amount of plants out there to take

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.639 
right amount of plants out there to take
maximum<00:02:07.120> use<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.990> what<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.350> have<00:02:08.530> available

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
maximum use of what you have available

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.170 
maximum use of what you have available
in<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.160> source<00:02:09.340> I<00:02:09.520> want<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> give<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.000> an

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
in the source I want to give you an

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.660 
in the source I want to give you an
example<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.230> fields<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.890> we're<00:02:12.280> going

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
example of the fields that we're going

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.980 
example of the fields that we're going
gained<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.090> most<00:02:13.300> out<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.630> doing<00:02:13.900> this

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
gained the most out of doing this

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.839 
gained the most out of doing this
variable<00:02:14.500> rate<00:02:14.650> planting<00:02:15.099> fields<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.700> have

sandbars running right through them and
it's<00:02:18.790> rented<00:02:19.270> ground<00:02:19.569> it's<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:19.989> like<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.290> own

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
it's rented ground it's not like we own

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
it's rented ground it's not like we own
the<00:02:20.500> ground<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.069> rented<00:02:21.459> ground<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.000> we'll

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the ground it's rented ground and we'll

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.600 
the ground it's rented ground and we'll
go<00:02:22.599> along<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.080> we'll<00:02:23.260> get<00:02:23.500> tremendous<00:02:23.860> yield

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
go along and we'll get tremendous yield

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.100 
go along and we'll get tremendous yield
tremendous<00:02:25.239> yield<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.660> all<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> sudden<00:02:25.870> we

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
tremendous yield and all of a sudden we

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.110 
tremendous yield and all of a sudden we
hit<00:02:26.200> those<00:02:26.380> sandbars<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.310> yield<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.730> like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
hit those sandbars and the yield is like

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.990 
hit those sandbars and the yield is like
one<00:02:28.540> third<00:02:29.020> or<00:02:29.290> less<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.280> couple<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.670> years<00:02:30.850> ago

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
one third or less a couple of years ago

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.900 
one third or less a couple of years ago
we<00:02:31.330> got<00:02:31.360> zero<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.530> those<00:02:32.770> areas<00:02:33.250> when<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.700> was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
we got zero in those areas when it was

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.940 
we got zero in those areas when it was
really<00:02:34.209> dry<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.020> what<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.440> want<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.739> do<00:02:35.830> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
really dry so what we want to do is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.559 
really dry so what we want to do is
we'll<00:02:36.100> be<00:02:36.130> planting<00:02:36.640> higher<00:02:36.790> populations

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
we'll be planting higher populations

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.449 
we'll be planting higher populations
when<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.110> hit<00:02:38.260> those<00:02:38.440> sandy<00:02:38.920> spots<00:02:39.190> we're

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
when we hit those sandy spots we're

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.520 
when we hit those sandy spots we're
gonna<00:02:39.550> cut<00:02:39.790> our<00:02:39.880> population<00:02:40.510> way<00:02:40.720> down<00:02:41.050> we'll

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
gonna cut our population way down we'll

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.470 
gonna cut our population way down we'll
put<00:02:41.739> less<00:02:42.010> fertilizer<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.849> there<00:02:43.090> we'll

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
put less fertilizer on there we'll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.380 
put less fertilizer on there we'll
manage<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.260> area<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.250> zone<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.150> little

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
manage that area that zone just a little

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.080 
manage that area that zone just a little
bit<00:02:46.540> differently<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.350> we<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.769> maximize

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
bit differently so we can maximize

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.460 
bit differently so we can maximize
overall<00:02:49.090> profitability<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.050> farm<00:02:50.290> and

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
overall profitability on the farm and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.009 
overall profitability on the farm and
also<00:02:51.010> maximize<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.000> grain<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.450> we're<00:02:52.900> going

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
also maximize the grain that we're going

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.840 
also maximize the grain that we're going
to<00:02:53.140> get<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.830> happens<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.640> put

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
to get see what happens is if you put

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.610 
to get see what happens is if you put
too<00:02:55.000> many<00:02:55.120> plants<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.780> an<00:02:55.930> area<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.440> doesn't

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
too many plants in an area that doesn't

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.289 
too many plants in an area that doesn't
have<00:02:56.830> much<00:02:57.010> moisture<00:02:57.489> or<00:02:57.549> much<00:02:57.730> fertility

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
have much moisture or much fertility

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.479 
have much moisture or much fertility
then<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:59.080> produce<00:02:59.260> nothing<00:02:59.620> but<00:02:59.950> if<00:03:00.040> we<00:03:00.190> only

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
then you produce nothing but if we only

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.340 
then you produce nothing but if we only
plant<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:01.030> few<00:03:01.209> plants<00:03:01.450> out<00:03:01.720> there<00:03:01.750> those

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
plant a few plants out there those

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.740 
plant a few plants out there those
plants<00:03:02.709> can<00:03:02.860> survive<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.610> put<00:03:03.790> ears<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:04.630> we

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
plants can survive and put ears on so we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.930 
plants can survive and put ears on so we
can<00:03:04.870> do<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.019> better<00:03:05.290> job<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.709> overall<00:03:06.640> crop

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
can do a better job of overall crop

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.570 
can do a better job of overall crop
production<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.600> produce<00:03:08.049> more<00:03:08.380> food<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:09.459> the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
production and produce more food for the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.880 
production and produce more food for the
US<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.180> kind<00:03:10.569> of<00:03:10.660> need<00:03:10.780> food<00:03:11.049> nowadays<00:03:11.380> you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
US we kind of need food nowadays you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.809 
US we kind of need food nowadays you
know<00:03:11.980> they're<00:03:12.100> talking<00:03:12.280> about<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.549> food

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
know they're talking about this food

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.210 
know they're talking about this food
versus<00:03:13.209> fuel<00:03:13.239> thing<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:13.870> farmers<00:03:14.440> we<00:03:14.709> want<00:03:15.130> to

versus fuel thing as farmers we want to
raise<00:03:15.370> more<00:03:15.850> food<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.290> with

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
raise more food and we can do it with

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.830 
raise more food and we can do it with

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
Darren said we did buy a new planter for

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.349 
Darren said we did buy a new planter for
this<00:03:26.980> next<00:03:27.220> spring<00:03:27.459> we're<00:03:27.640> going<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.910> put<00:03:28.090> some

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
this next spring we're going to put some

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.060 
this next spring we're going to put some
a<00:03:28.540> new<00:03:28.720> case<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.109> H<00:03:29.230> planner<00:03:29.560> we're<00:03:29.799> going<00:03:29.980> to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
a new case a H planner we're going to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.190 
a new case a H planner we're going to
put<00:03:30.220> some<00:03:30.459> AG<00:03:30.640> leader<00:03:31.090> units<00:03:31.570> on<00:03:31.750> there<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.109> we

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
put some AG leader units on there so we

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.860 
put some AG leader units on there so we
can<00:03:32.350> control<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.070> rate<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.910> our<00:03:34.180> seeding<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
can control the rate of our seeding and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.810 
can control the rate of our seeding and
plant<00:03:35.290> higher<00:03:35.620> populations<00:03:36.370> where<00:03:36.519> we<00:03:36.640> need

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
plant higher populations where we need

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.520 
plant higher populations where we need
it<00:03:36.850> lower<00:03:37.209> populations<00:03:37.930> where<00:03:38.109> we<00:03:38.230> need<00:03:38.380> it

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
it lower populations where we need it

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.140 
it lower populations where we need it
it's<00:03:38.650> gonna<00:03:38.739> be<00:03:38.920> fun<00:03:39.100> well<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.700> don't<00:03:39.940> have

this equipment you could still do the

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.680 
this equipment you could still do the
same<00:03:42.040> thing<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.400> could<00:03:42.549> get<00:03:42.760> out<00:03:42.910> make<00:03:43.480> some

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
same thing you could get out make some

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.479 
same thing you could get out make some
adjustments<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.260> your<00:03:44.320> planter<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.130> problem

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
adjustments on your planter the problem

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.860 
adjustments on your planter the problem
is<00:03:45.609> in<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> spring<00:03:46.090> everyone's<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> hurry

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
is in the spring everyone's in a hurry

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.990 
is in the spring everyone's in a hurry
trying<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.799> crop<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:48.970> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
trying to get the crop in and it is a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.060 
trying to get the crop in and it is a
little<00:03:49.269> bit<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.570> work<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:50.019> most<00:03:50.290> machines<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
little bit of work on most machines to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.130 
little bit of work on most machines to
make<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.730> change<00:03:52.090> out<00:03:52.359> there<00:03:52.600> with<00:03:52.870> new

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
make that change out there with new

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.170 
make that change out there with new
high-tech<00:03:53.620> equipment<00:03:53.920> it'll<00:03:54.489> shift<00:03:54.730> for<00:03:55.090> you

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
high-tech equipment it'll shift for you

on the go so as you're driving across

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.770 
on the go so as you're driving across
the<00:03:57.489> field<00:03:57.700> you've<00:03:57.910> got<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.239> field<00:03:58.450> mapped

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
the field you've got the field mapped

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.479 
the field you've got the field mapped
out<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.440> can<00:03:59.590> change<00:03:59.829> that<00:04:00.069> variable

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
out and you can change that variable

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.520 
out and you can change that variable
seating<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.510> good<00:04:01.660> deal<00:04:01.780> yeah<00:04:02.049> it's<00:04:02.230> an<00:04:02.500> ax
