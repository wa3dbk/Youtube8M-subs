added some chin hair the outfit as I
mentioned<00:02:04.469> before<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.460> odd

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
mentioned before it's kind of odd

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
mentioned before it's kind of odd
because<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.360> see-through<00:02:06.689> originally

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
because it was see-through originally

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.830 
because it was see-through originally
but<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.220> decided<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.759> paint<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
but here they decided to paint it a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.589 
but here they decided to paint it a
little<00:02:10.020> darker<00:02:10.649> than<00:02:10.830> skin<00:02:11.190> tone<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
little darker than skin tone to kind of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.990 
little darker than skin tone to kind of
a
