00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.180
 welcome to this video tutorial today 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.270
 I'm going to show you how to assemble a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.390
 installation of windows 8 on a disk 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.750
 hard usb for it previously I have 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.870
 downloaded an installation iso of 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 windows 8 from the microsoft site 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 can you use any other I've 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.900
 mounted through damon tools 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.050
 why the incognito that appears in this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050
 side 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.630
 and the files are already mounted on the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.630
 unit g 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.900
 well the first thing we should do is 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.020
 prepare the usb hard drive to be able to 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.770
 host the files and to make it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 profitable car 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.629
 I like I already have windows 8 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.680
 I use the windows x keys to go to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680
 disk manager 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.080
 unit 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 as you can see here 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 h of usb is the p 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.670
 it is formatted 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.590
 he changed the name 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
 and then we will make sure 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.610
 once you have finished formatting that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.270
 the partition is the active 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.190
 We hope to change the name already is 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.220
 well as the menu is disabled that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.960
 means that the partition is active if 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.290
 we would not have to mark this element 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.290
 from the menu 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 well then what we're going to go is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.670
 to the wood folder 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.970
 of the windows 8 installation disc 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.550
 to do auto run cable the hard drive 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.240
 usb 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.920
 we return to the keyboard shortcut windows xy 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.920
 we go to the symbol of the system 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.200
 in administrator mode and this is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.200
 important 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
 administrator 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.829
 let's go to the unit g 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.469
 the unit that has downloaded me from 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.069
 microsoft where is the original disk 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.700
 of the installation of windows 8 we enter 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.480
 in the boot folder 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.480
 and we execute 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.120
 the next command butschek with the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.950
 parameter in this 60 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 so that it generates 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.830
 what is necessary for the unit that is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.970
 the hdd usb hard drive 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.970
 be autorun cable 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.300
 well as you can see 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.860
 it is right 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.860
 we went out 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.340
 and now it would only be 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.340
 copy the files 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.950
 on the hard drive 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.750
 what have we done 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.860
 auto run cable 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.930
 remember that if you want to perform now 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.830
 the installation you will have to enter the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.980
 bios of your computer so that the 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.190
 usb hard drive be more priority more 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.150
 priority in the boot that the disk 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.810
 hard pc 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.750
 once the installation starts and it 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.239
 asks you to restart in the next one 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.299
 on that restart remember to put back 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.459
 the highest priority PC hard drive in 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.530
 the boot than the usb hard drive 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.730
 so that it does not start again 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.739
 installing windows 8 good I hope 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.759
