 I wanted it more or less there for 76 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.869

 video yesterday without me asking for 11 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 the ripper that the new s mg and the code 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.850
 on the machine should be 2 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.520
 Let's just say it's like you 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.159
 You know, many shanks personalities come out. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.720
 eurocodes is as much camouflage as it is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.009
 customization item for your character 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.420

 voice of his judges basically it okay 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.170
 logical that they will do something to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 to catch the eye they put nothing 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.829
 dollars 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.509
