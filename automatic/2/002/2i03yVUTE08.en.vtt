this short lesson shows the use of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.340 
this short lesson shows the use of
chromatic<00:00:17.670> scales<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.750> part<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.199> your

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
chromatic scales as part of your

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.160 
chromatic scales as part of your
improvisation<00:00:19.740> sequence<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:21.960> thing

you<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.010> play<00:00:23.340> something<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
improvise over and in this case it's a C

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.839 
improvise over and in this case it's a C

each<00:00:32.460> chord<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.110> want<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> big<00:00:34.469> Fistful

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
each chord you do not want a big Fistful

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
each chord you do not want a big Fistful
of<00:00:35.130> chord<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.450> notes<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> you
