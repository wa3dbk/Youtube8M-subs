00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
be wrong but just like a new color

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 
be wrong but just like a new color
overlay<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.689> still<00:01:43.110> looks<00:01:43.439> amazing

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
overlay but it still looks amazing

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.670 
overlay but it still looks amazing
overall

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
overall

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.520 
overall
um<00:01:46.000> see<00:01:47.000> what<00:01:47.150> else<00:01:47.300> prime<00:01:47.780> critical<00:01:48.410> I<00:01:48.500> think

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
um see what else prime critical I think

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.290 
um see what else prime critical I think
this<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.370> new<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.580> haven't<00:01:49.940> seen<00:01:50.150> this

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
this is kind of new I haven't seen this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.650 
this is kind of new I haven't seen this
before<00:01:50.920> over<00:01:51.920> time<00:01:52.160> or<00:01:52.460> when<00:01:52.640> attacking<00:01:53.000> crit

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
before over time or when attacking crit

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.160 
before over time or when attacking crit
crit<00:01:54.200> rate<00:01:54.440> plus<00:01:54.920> four<00:01:55.280> percent<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:57.020> think

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
crit rate plus four percent so I think

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.360 
crit rate plus four percent so I think
that<00:01:57.410> kind<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.770> stacks<00:01:58.190> over<00:01:58.460> with<00:01:59.140> the<00:02:00.370> this

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
that kind of stacks over with the this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.180 
that kind of stacks over with the this
thing<00:02:01.640> critical<00:02:02.360> bro<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:03.470> probably<00:02:03.710> a

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
thing critical bro so that's probably a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.690 
thing critical bro so that's probably a
six<00:02:04.970> percent<00:02:05.390> increase<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.200> your<00:02:06.350> crib<00:02:06.700> so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
six percent increase of your crib so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.219 
six percent increase of your crib so
that's<00:02:07.729> pretty<00:02:08.090> awesome<00:02:08.179> too<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.929> don't<00:02:09.110> have

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that's pretty awesome too I don't have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's pretty awesome too I don't have
all<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.619> stats<00:02:09.830> maxed<00:02:10.280> out<00:02:10.399> because<00:02:10.850> I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
all the stats maxed out because I

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
to do more damage than you see I kinda

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.089 
to do more damage than you see I kinda
agree<00:04:55.669> with<00:04:55.909> that<00:04:56.439> considering<00:04:57.439> that<00:04:57.469> it<00:04:57.889> used

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
agree with that considering that it used

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.879 
agree with that considering that it used
to<00:04:58.250> do<00:04:58.400> like<00:04:58.580> eight<00:04:58.879> stacks<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.599> damage<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.740> if

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
to do like eight stacks of damage so if

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.559 
to do like eight stacks of damage so if
they<00:05:01.039> were<00:05:01.099> to<00:05:01.310> keep<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.759> instead<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.300> all

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
they were to keep that instead of all

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.110 
they were to keep that instead of all
these<00:05:02.719> homing<00:05:03.199> missiles<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.830> think<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:04.969> would

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
these homing missiles I think it would

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.930 
these homing missiles I think it would
have<00:05:05.330> been<00:05:05.419> a<00:05:05.479> lot<00:05:05.599> a<00:05:06.139> lot<00:05:06.500> better<00:05:06.860> than<00:05:07.639> just

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
have been a lot a lot better than just

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.020 
have been a lot a lot better than just
having<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.229> vessels<00:05:10.039> like<00:05:10.280> kind<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.669> home<00:05:10.819> on

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
having the vessels like kind of home on

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.350 
having the vessels like kind of home on
the<00:05:11.150> monsters<00:05:11.599> but<00:05:12.469> for<00:05:13.190> me<00:05:13.340> not<00:05:13.699> playing<00:05:13.969> a

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
the monsters but for me not playing a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300 
the monsters but for me not playing a
shallower<00:05:14.690> in<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.080> while<00:05:15.259> I<00:05:15.590> find<00:05:15.889> that<00:05:16.039> new

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
shallower in the while I find that new

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.249 
shallower in the while I find that new
animation<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.270> new<00:05:17.449> homing<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.080> is

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
animation and the new homing this is

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.040 
animation and the new homing this is
kind<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.620> likeable<00:05:19.129> it<00:05:19.669> still<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:20.750> think<00:05:20.960> it

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
kind of likeable it still I think it

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.300 
kind of likeable it still I think it
still<00:05:21.379> does<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.770> /<00:05:22.490> damage<00:05:23.030> kind<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.449> thing

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
still does that / damage kind of thing

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.830 
still does that / damage kind of thing
depending<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.430> how<00:05:25.610> many<00:05:25.669> mesos<00:05:26.270> hits<00:05:26.599> that

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
depending on how many mesos hits that

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.600 
depending on how many mesos hits that
one<00:05:26.990> monster<00:05:27.529> so<00:05:28.520> that's<00:05:28.879> pretty<00:05:29.150> good<00:05:29.419> too<00:05:29.719> um

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
one monster so that's pretty good too um

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.730 
one monster so that's pretty good too um
some<00:05:31.610> other<00:05:31.849> things<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.599> I<00:05:32.810> do<00:05:32.990> like<00:05:33.469> about

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
some other things that I do like about

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
the shadow ER the shadowy revamp is uh

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.969 
the shadow ER the shadowy revamp is uh
this<00:05:38.479> little<00:05:39.080> icon<00:05:39.289> right<00:05:39.500> here<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:41.800> think<00:05:42.800> I

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
this little icon right here I think I

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.230 
this little icon right here I think I
don't<00:05:43.129> know<00:05:43.219> what<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.430> is<00:05:43.460> but<00:05:43.759> it's<00:05:43.909> like<00:05:44.090> it

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
don't know what that is but it's like it

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.420 
don't know what that is but it's like it
says<00:05:44.389> a<00:05:44.419> plus<00:05:44.840> 5<00:05:45.110> max<00:05:45.560> of<00:05:45.830> my<00:05:45.949> shadow<00:05:46.219> where

says a plus 5 max of my shadow where

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.519 
says a plus 5 max of my shadow where
instinct<00:05:46.969> I<00:05:47.180> don't<00:05:47.810> know<00:05:47.870> whether<00:05:48.020> if<00:05:48.319> it

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
instinct I don't know whether if it

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.290 
instinct I don't know whether if it
increases<00:05:48.860> my<00:05:49.129> shower<00:05:49.490> words<00:05:49.789> think<00:05:50.000> or<00:05:50.120> not

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
increases my shower words think or not

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.490 
increases my shower words think or not
but<00:05:51.139> that's<00:05:51.919> really<00:05:52.310> helpful<00:05:53.199> let<00:05:54.199> me<00:05:54.319> be

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
