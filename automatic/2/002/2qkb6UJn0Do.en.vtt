tutorial I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.249 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
make<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> dramatic<00:00:04.830> black<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.400> white<00:00:05.580> look<00:00:06.259> so

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
make a dramatic black and white look so

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.530 
make a dramatic black and white look so
as<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.740> see<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.189> example<00:00:08.420> what<00:00:09.420> we

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
as you can see on this example what we

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
as you can see on this example what we
have<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> left<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.340> dramatic<00:00:11.550> black

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
have on the left is the dramatic black

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.390 
have on the left is the dramatic black
and<00:00:12.389> white<00:00:12.570> what<00:00:13.320> we<00:00:13.469> have<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.099> side

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and white what we have on the right side

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
and white what we have on the right side
is<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.120> regular<00:00:15.570> black<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.529> white<00:00:16.710> or

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
is just a regular black and white or

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.000 
is just a regular black and white or
desaturation<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.289> we're<00:00:19.439> trying<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> create

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
desaturation so we're trying to create

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.240 
desaturation so we're trying to create
the<00:00:20.160> effect<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> left<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.070> just

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the effect on the left so if we just

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.089 
the effect on the left so if we just
work<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.580> our<00:00:23.730> original<00:00:24.210> photo<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.830> all<00:00:25.830> we

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
work on our original photo here all we

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
work on our original photo here all we
need<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.279> do<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.760> add<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.330> simple<00:00:27.900> adjustment

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
need to do is add one simple adjustment

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130 
need to do is add one simple adjustment
layer<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.429> look<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.630> head<00:00:30.779> over<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
layer to get this look so head over to

85% now if you want more of a contrast

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.730 
85% now if you want more of a contrast
you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.750> bring<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> black<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> white

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you can bring the black and white

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
you can bring the black and white
sliders<00:01:29.189> closer<00:01:29.520> together<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> want

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
sliders closer together or if you want

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
sliders closer together or if you want
less<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> contrast<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.220> leave<00:01:32.340> them

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
less of a contrast you can leave them
