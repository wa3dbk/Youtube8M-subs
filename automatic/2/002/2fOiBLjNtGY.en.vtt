00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.750
 I received a call from a friend who live 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.670
 in the West Bank 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.560
 he told me that a foreign painter is 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.970
 came to gaza and did a drawing and 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.779
 only once after finishing it and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.730
 leave gaza 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.980
 he wanted video footage of this drawing 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.960
 but when they came to film 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.270
 they found that the children had 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.200
 damaged some places of this drawing they 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.710
 asked me to do some 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.469
 retouching 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.300
 I only touched up on 1% of 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.460
 drawing they did not say they had 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.230
 which was drawn painter then this has 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.390
 was a surprise to me when I saw 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.410
 in the media we talked about banksy and 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.240
 from his presence at gaza 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.770
 of course I heard about banking 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.870
 if before I know it's a big 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.040
 internationally renowned artist very 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.810
 known for his drawings that cause 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.670
 always controversy and that pose 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.950
 questions that talks about things that get 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.480
 relate to humanity I do not exaggerate 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.190
 saying that I still do not believe 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.820
 that I had an even indirect touch 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.100
 with banksy 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.720
 it's a nice feeling I felt 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.250
 something very big because 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.020
 the touch-ups that I did on the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.909
 drawing is something very 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.880
 modest it's just to help in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.740
 making a simple gesture even that it has me 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 deeply marked the graphic design 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.249
 and basing it on simplicity for 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.359
 convey the idea because this art 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.219
 is for everyone 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.109
 it is an art far from exhibitions and 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.969
 museum that needs a decor of the 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.100
 light and especially that addresses to 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.580
 the elite to people like artists or 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 Christians and those who endlessly 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 banksy count the came to gaza he did 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.370
 a permanent exhibition that addresses 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 to all social classes palestine 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.330
 and that's what makes his work united 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.910
 hilarious graffiti in general 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.350
 the specificity of beauties and who speaks 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.660
 sensitive issues and advocates 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.550
 manual favor breast what left some 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.350
 traces in the Gaza band is that it 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.810
 has gone through a critical period 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 after the war is under blockade he has 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.290
 left deep traces and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.660
 the morale of people and he did appreciate 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.040
 this kind of drawing to people I believe 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.440
 that it was a nice gesture on the part 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 of a bauxite bomb artist from 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.040
 switch to gaza 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.400
 in my opinion he wanted to transmit a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 message through this cat for beth 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.150
 Hanoune as a disaster area 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
 the band of gaza the cat is in the process of 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.870
 search the rubble to find 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.670
 something to play he was looking for 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.500
 child of the wool ball or are 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.150
 parties as young and those who 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.800
 communicate this symbol is that of the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 scrap replaces the east ball where 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.280
 the balloon there are a lot of symbols 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.200
 in his drawings it's a point of view 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 on his work everyone sees his end
