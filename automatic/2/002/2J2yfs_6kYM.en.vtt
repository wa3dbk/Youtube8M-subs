welcome<00:00:01.500> back<00:00:01.680> here's<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.490> change<00:00:02.850> the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
welcome back here's how to change the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
welcome back here's how to change the
oil<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.389> mean<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.659> one<00:00:03.840> note<00:00:04.080> first<00:00:04.950> remove

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
oil I mean this one note first remove

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.530 
oil I mean this one note first remove
the<00:00:06.080> top<00:00:07.080> oil<00:00:07.290> cap<00:00:07.760> leave<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.970> loosely<00:00:09.330> in

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
the top oil cap leave it loosely in

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
the top oil cap leave it loosely in
position<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.200> dose<00:00:10.500> doesn't<00:00:10.860> get<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.099> there

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
position so dose doesn't get in there

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.849 
position so dose doesn't get in there
and<00:00:12.980> some<00:00:13.980> takes<00:00:14.309> 4.5<00:00:15.059> liters<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.540> oil<00:00:15.859> now

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and some takes 4.5 liters of oil now

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.890 
and some takes 4.5 liters of oil now
I've<00:00:17.039> already<00:00:17.369> drained<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.910> oil<00:00:18.109> but<00:00:19.820> to

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
I've already drained the oil but to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.710 
I've already drained the oil but to
access<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.470> oil<00:00:23.039> drain<00:00:23.369> clog<00:00:23.670> its<00:00:23.939> underneath

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
access the oil drain clog its underneath

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.609 
access the oil drain clog its underneath
on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> driver<00:00:26.160> side<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> front<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.500> it's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
on the driver side at the front and it's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550 
on the driver side at the front and it's
a<00:00:28.740> number<00:00:28.949> fourteen<00:00:29.369> socket<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:31.260> torque

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
a number fourteen socket on the torque

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
a number fourteen socket on the torque
on<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.099> thirty<00:00:32.430> four<00:00:32.640> Newton<00:00:33.000> meters<00:00:33.300> as

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
on that is thirty four Newton meters as

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.240 
on that is thirty four Newton meters as
well<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.649> automatic

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
well just like the automatic

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.490 
well just like the automatic
transmission<00:00:35.899> drain<00:00:36.899> plug<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.660> need

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
transmission drain plug so you just need

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
transmission drain plug so you just need
a<00:00:40.559> copper<00:00:41.010> seeding<00:00:41.340> washer<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a copper seeding washer and this is the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
a copper seeding washer and this is the
same<00:00:43.559> washer<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.190> used<00:00:44.489> unloaded<00:00:45.059> my

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
same washer that's used unloaded my

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.720 
same washer that's used unloaded my
transmission<00:00:45.719> drain<00:00:46.079> plug<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
transmission drain plug so you got to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.660 
transmission drain plug so you got to
get<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> those<00:00:48.210> otherwise<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> oil<00:00:50.100> soap

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
get one of those otherwise the oil soap

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
get one of those otherwise the oil soap
will<00:00:50.969> leak<00:00:51.210> oil<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.230> plug<00:00:54.079> when

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
will leak oil through the plug when

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
will leak oil through the plug when
you've<00:00:55.230> talked<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.489> thirty<00:00:57.090> four

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you've talked that up to thirty four

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.740 
you've talked that up to thirty four
Newton<00:00:57.600> meters<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.109> remove<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.070> oil<00:00:59.100> filter

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.350 

and<00:01:01.840> it<00:01:02.740> will<00:01:03.130> be<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.370> quite<00:01:03.700> tight<00:01:04.030> so<00:01:04.270> you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
and it will be on quite tight so you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.470 
and it will be on quite tight so you
might<00:01:04.510> need<00:01:04.660> tool<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.200> get<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.380> off<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.450> just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
might need tool to get it off and just

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.330 
might need tool to get it off and just
wipe<00:01:07.960> down<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.230> side<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.830> engine<00:01:08.980> block

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
wipe down the side of the engine block

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
wipe down the side of the engine block
with<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> cloth<00:01:10.470> drain<00:01:11.470> all<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.680> oil<00:01:12.010> out<00:01:12.040> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.430 

fit<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> new<00:01:16.540> filter<00:01:18.510> but<00:01:19.510> before<00:01:20.050> you<00:01:20.230> fit

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
fit the new filter but before you fit

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.690 
fit the new filter but before you fit
the<00:01:20.590> new<00:01:20.740> filter<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:24.430> some

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
the new filter you have to get some

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.290 
the new filter you have to get some
clean<00:01:25.210> new<00:01:25.630> engine<00:01:26.020> oil<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:27.160> put<00:01:27.520> some

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
clean new engine oil and just put some

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.600 
clean new engine oil and just put some
one<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.630> rubber<00:01:28.870> ring<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.220> gets<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.460> good

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
one the rubber ring so it gets a good

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.650 
one the rubber ring so it gets a good
seal<00:01:30.910> against<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> side<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.900> engine<00:01:33.660> so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
seal against the side of the engine so

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.380 
seal against the side of the engine so
just<00:01:34.869> remember<00:01:35.260> with<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.500> new<00:01:35.680> filter<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.390> an
