 side of the picture it's a bit tense 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.550
 between the 2 9 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.670
 rory kockott wanted to show that he 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 also had seen here and there 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.700
 it welcomes more he escaped a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.030
 yellow cardboard for veneer at the head a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 little unorthodox strangulation 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.540
 South African which leads to a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.309
 dimitri penalty yachvili his foot 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 left has settled right away in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.390
 his garden of aguilera 3 to 0 is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 biarritz who shows himself effective who 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 also shows enterprising after this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.489
 touch the castrais who gets down to the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.739
 fault the ongoing benefits for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 biarritz a few minutes later the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 vista of yachvili always in master at 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 play his forwards who advance and pass 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 on foot for maybe raphaël lakafia 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 positioned in number 7 today the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.390
 go a little long no trial 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.430
 but a penalty 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.170
 it was the first opportunity to biarrotte 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 fabien remains of the first opportunity that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 came to materialize a good domination 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 at the level of the territory of the tourniquets and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.729
 especially we work well done and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 castres in all that will you tell me he 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.939
 had castres average rates plays as soon 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 that they can castrais it with 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.540
 including the appropriateness of acrobatics 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 also as caballero who takes this 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.020
 ball 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 with the foot and then cocotte who sees 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.830
 which creates a shift in the small side 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 for the overflow of roman martial 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.530
 was replacing today martial well 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.820
 plated by fabian balshaw yes even though 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.470
 the opportunities of a caste reasons 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.850
 were few in this first 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.400
 half time they remained dangerous 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.890
 especially by rory kockott who knew 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.570
 animate around these groupings 12 to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.700
 3 for biarritz at half time 4 1 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.130
 Yachvili penalty 4 out of 4 before the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.840
 eyes under the eyes of all damien 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.600
 traille and then the scrub biarrot a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 little bit jostled but there is also 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 the initiative side well with this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.550
 inspiration from marcelo bosch argentin 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.800
 in the center voice and marcelo bosch who 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.650
 find an interval between scrum and 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.240
 the line defense castraise and that ends 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.160
 at the foot when it could have been 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.630
 continue to make a shadow pass a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 due it should have been to the golden balls of the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.459
 noise seen the end of the action the income 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.320
 since benoît baby had gone to his 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.150
 height on the right he prefers the foot 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.670
 it saturday saturday has really had very little 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 that ngwenya then retype the ball and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.910
 then went to point in ut 15 to 3 for 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.530
 biarritz so that concretizes this time 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.290
 strong this great initiative of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.730
 the Argentinian and then it's the milks 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.890
 castric tries to get his hands on 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110
 the balloon an action since they have the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.400
 wind in the back also an action a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.140
 castrais time that will be 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.730
 rewarded with a penalty and a time 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.440
 castrated they have a cost and its 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.810
 men are looking for intervals 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.140
 in the biarrote defense but until 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.560
 bout he 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.700
 they stumbled on 7 out of 7 defensives so 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.340
 they were forced to furnish the score 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.989
 appears the game at the foot of coconut 15 to 3 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.450
 since 15 to 6 so after this penalty 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.550
 cocottes but here is the left foot of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 dimitri yachvili goes wrong the wind him 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.510
 was unfavorable and the balloon flees the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 posts four failures in this 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.640
 second period for the scrum-half 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.440
 biarritz and the castrais who are trying 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.390
 to ignite the game with particular 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.530
 the entrance of thales against is still 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.810
 long there we say that it's there 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.739

 that pedro tongue pick up the ball and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.599
 is then caught by thales 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.459
 is forced to stoop they do not arrive 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.250
 not to put off the gas to go 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.769

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.930
 take-away minute triggered by the 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.680
 before biarrots with arnaud heguy at the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.840
 order 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.069
 yachvili that departs for peyrelongue 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.470
 speed with 7 passes and 2 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.599
 interceptions toro mccabe at the entrance to 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.959
 this moment we believe in the blows of 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.280
 theater 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.290
 finally sir mathieu a penalty 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.780
 it's the payroll for them for 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.910
 the biarrots on this penalty which has 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.250
 been a little litigious on the on 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.569
 the on the bench prevail but in all 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.370
 Roman case cabannes did some 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.040
 scares in all the biarrot audience 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.650
 fourth failure for yachvili in this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.260
 second period last scrum for 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.959
 castres the siren does not want to delay to 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.510
 sound and therefore penalty in favor of 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.389
 rory kockott the number one director 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.579
 top 14 for bonus bonus point 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.210
 for castres it goes 15 to 9 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.590
 final score logical score of course everything 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.419
 the world is happy we can see the picture 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.280
 from laurent through to dimitri yachvili or 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.800
 at the biarritz has won rest in the 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.330
 race for qualification and castres 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.979

 castrais who asked us a lot of 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.050
 problems they kept very well the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.130
 balloon we a little bit feverish 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.740
 I think we could have with a little 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.410
 more success at the foot 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.789
 have a slightly more favorable score and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.070
 to be a little safer 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.870
 it was a bit of a mess but I would say 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.210
 we have been solid we have been united 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.510
 and victory is important to us 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.510
 tonight
