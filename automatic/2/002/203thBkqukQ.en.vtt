00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello everyone in this video will be about 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.830
 soldering plastic probably everyone either 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.510
 have you ever come across 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 maybe with such a problem when you fall 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.570
 plastic crumbles all fucking 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.940
 in this video I will show one example 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 soldering plastic is not a video lesson not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 video is an indication of how to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.289
 do personally i do so there is still 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.330
 many types of soldering but I will tell 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 today about one of them soldering 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.719
 soldering iron and solder can still hairdryer 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.880
 everyone there specifically here I have to do 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.920
 it was a pitbike pitster pro from 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.379
 I got the previous owner 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 nishtyaki a broken plastic well, 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.030
 many more things have been fixed at all 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 but specifically there is no plastic behind 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.000
 can see as always it happens 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 such a cool dude has come become 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 collapse and you like this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 it turns out two pieces of plastic so it 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.620
 It was a matter of principle very well 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 waste plastic where not visible 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 okay, a few pieces 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.159
 principle, even the seam is not visible, it will not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 I will not strip or steal anything but 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.580
 principle is not necessary 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.049
 soldering iron I already basking in well here 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 general, I will start now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.060
 soldering plastic base well I took it off 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.970
 plastic so it looks like this solder 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.119
 one shock well what's all about 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.799
 principle of soldering let's choose these two parts 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.630
 combine as they are without paint it is not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.490
 it is necessary to protect anything already, in principle, everything 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.009
 just wipe the highway 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 and dirt and start soldering technology 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.350
 I will show before starting soldering 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 painted plastic from motorcycles every 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.000
 it is necessary to repainted on the edge that is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 here 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.899
 peeling paint can preliminary 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.670
 be there I do not know anything can be there 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.950
 sandpaper something else just 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.909
 further she will burst and file 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.680
 the seam but now I will start the most such 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.000
 so I combined before you understand them 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 it is necessary to combine the seam 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.290
 as tight as possible further by concreteness 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.290
 soldering soldering begin to solder 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.230
 we kind of swim where the soldering iron and do 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.600
 such as the waves further we take 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.820
 smearing that is, it turns out as if 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.490
 we mix plastic one part another 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 as if the soldering iron is not quite the one for 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.410
 these goals are more convenient than ordinary direct 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.100
 I have at hand another sky therefore 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.100
 do this 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:44.870
 here is one side done now then 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:48.230
 the corner Well, in general, that's all 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.990
 In general, I soldered the plastic 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.460
 here it is the whole curve I'm a little bit now 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.550
 will process quite a bit and the ideal 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.800
 Here I will not bring this here by 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.360
 the edges did not solder the fact that the soldering iron is not 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.780
 prolazil given to me in general and to anything 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.000
 here 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.250
 pleased that the plastic is very thick 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.770
 what is thin when plastic is it 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.440
 immediately burns such a method as if soldering 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.110
 he may sometimes not fit sometimes 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.760
 if this is any force words there 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 plastic number it is better as a thread 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.650
 reinforce there for example fiberglass or 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.489
 some kind of epoxy and not on 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.190
 such a 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.260
 I hope that someone this video was 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.480
 interesting or useful therefore 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.580
 subscribe to my channel i will 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.320
 I hope to release a lot of interesting videos 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.510
 interesting also leave your 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.670
 comments under the video on youtube not 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.830
 We forget to put the Huskies also have 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.370
 vkontakte link will be in the description 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.370
 so
