00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
not sure i was thinking about doing a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.140 
not sure i was thinking about doing a
competitive<00:04:05.799> montage<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.459> can<00:04:06.610> be<00:04:06.700> like<00:04:06.880> a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
competitive montage I can be like a

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.840 
competitive montage I can be like a
public<00:04:07.959> montage<00:04:08.380> or<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.890> could<00:04:09.190> even<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.580> both

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
public montage or I could even be both

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.600 
public montage or I could even be both
and<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:11.320> would<00:04:11.500> republic<00:04:11.920> montage<00:04:12.310> would<00:04:12.489> just

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
and I would republic montage would just

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.509 
and I would republic montage would just
be<00:04:12.760> like<00:04:12.790> sprays<00:04:13.600> with<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.170> feeds<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.280> stuff

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519
