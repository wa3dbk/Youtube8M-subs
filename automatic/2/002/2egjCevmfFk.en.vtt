 that is also public there everyone can 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.310

 That was really cool that was 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 The best thing about the stand was the bartender 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.299
 in vain made rings and now easy 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.170

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.319
 All things were actually you 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.450
 wanted to say if we were such a ne 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.980
 chatting are already going on it would be 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.750

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.879

 Feedback the thumbs up really top off 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.680
 Next week it will be even better because 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.840
 starts the best time of the year 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 at least as far as technology is concerned with ifa 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.829
 then comes the new iphone already 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.109
 noted cell phone rausgebracht and 41 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.670
 megapixel all the videos come all 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.829
 very soon we are looking forward to it i hope 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.260
 we too and now let's get away 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.299
 I look at myself with my buddy 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.769
 joshua often turns me on 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.450
 these videos helps in swimmer 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.680
 gone to test if this cover 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.690
 does what she promises 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.849
 Of course, one replaces one without a mobile phone 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.609
 inside that means pushing up 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.650
 turn the levers to the side and then the 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.480
 Keep the cover under the water if you are now 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.030
 bubbles would rise then 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.829
 mean that water will come to hell 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.329
 that was not the case and so 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.440
 said cover already the first part of 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.069
 passed our test 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.200
 and now it gets serious or half serious 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.690
 because I have the sunniest pz what from 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.669
 house is already waterproof so well 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
 then water would come in then 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.150
 my cell phone would not break 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.609
 but I anticipate that remains 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.120
 dry there is nothing through cell phones 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.880
 in it 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.709
 is above the locked and it can be 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.900
 as always perfect use 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.639
 it 's even so good that one easily 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.530
 can write an sms 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.810
 if I would be on water on it 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.329
 then that does not go down immediately because 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.299
 is still air in the envelope inside 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.870
 under water but it really can 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.790
 not bad 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.830
 if now I really try to press in 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.900
 the love is crazy on it but even 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.060
 if there something does then is it 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.019
 not on my sake but further 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 only by chance 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.150
 But what goes under water is filming 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.609
 and make photos and recordings see 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.590
 you at the end of the view are really good 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.690
 So for me , I'm the one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.520
 summer this cover really holds 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.169
 dense effect is an area I would 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.900
 Say for example is a sandy beach 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.300
 because they are still later or are planning 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.130
 among you what you are on the beach 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
 have a cell phone perfect protect and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.910
 you wanted to film something under water 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.060
 then you have a really good one here 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.919
 found the product that makes it possible for you 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.100
 I love it again and the one with 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.830
 you leave no water drops inside 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.930
 So now the video is finally here 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.330
 I say then it comes to shiver that 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.940
 right on the ifa or on facebook and 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.940
 or twitter list new alex
