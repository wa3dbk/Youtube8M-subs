00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.010 
so this instrument it's kind of new to
me<00:03:05.630> but<00:03:06.280> everything<00:03:07.280> about<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.240> ideal

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
me but everything about it is so ideal

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.620 
me but everything about it is so ideal
for<00:03:09.050> what<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.440> look<00:03:09.680> for<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.010> sound<00:03:10.400> viola<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
for what I look for in sound viola I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.559 
for what I look for in sound viola I
used<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.470> play<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.920> slightly<00:03:13.280> smaller

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569
