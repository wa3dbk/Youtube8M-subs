00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.470
 good city kids by everis and 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.810
 Lord as you have heard it will 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.340
 teach how to make a formula sound 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.930
 1 in gta 5 and the truth is that it has 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.670
 seemed like a pretty good curiosity 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.930
 it's not a trick or anything but it 's something 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.310
 quite curious with the new sounds 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.169
 that he has gotten and good because the truth is 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.450
 it's really cool we've been casting 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.590
 a laugh that the wow and teach how to 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.510
 Do the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 put your vehicle to the saints 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.470
 custom does not matter which car is worth not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.420
 will change the sound and what you have 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.370
 what to do is go to atl action and put 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 one that is called a scale of fa 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.890
 OK and good once we have the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.140
 Of course, the only thing we have to do 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 is to go down the street with the only thing 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.260
 we have to do is to run by 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.329
 next to someone and chipping 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.039
 simply because you are in a game 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.359
 online and you see down the street running 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.969
 inviting at the same time and when you 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.710
 go by or be ahead of 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.120
 someone will listen to you as if you were a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.469
 formula one not the truth is that it is 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.879
 Pretty cool is something quite funny 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.220
 that has really touched me and I wanted 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.450
 show you what is a simple curiosity and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.030
 Well I'll teach you how 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.320
 listen to the sound for the other 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.820
 people because you are not going to 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.620
 listen like now I'm going to teach 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 also how it sounds for you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.189
 same or for the person who 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.170
 and also for the person who is 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.729
 listening so well then first 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.600
 I will put as it sounds to the other 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.600
 person who is like that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.159
 the truth is that it is quite 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.049
 handsome looks with formula 1 and the way in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.970
 what we would listen to doing 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.950
 this would be like that, so it's normal 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.479
 car chirping vale but I do not know why 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.790
 because the other players listen to us 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.500
 the other way different so good 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.149
 Well, I'm going to just put a couple of 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.409
 It takes more for you to listen to it and nothing 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.149
 I hope you liked that 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.680
