00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello guys welcome to this new 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.250
 video and today I bring you a top 5 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.509
 bosch network repositories for this day 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.089
 surely many people have done the 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.989
 jailbreak in our last days with 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.250
 new edition and if you are not very if not 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.500
 You have tried much getting 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.570
 surely a little bit of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.310
 recommendation of a few 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.400
 repositories so you do not need 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.499
 no more to be able to download everything 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.849
 that you need without having to have many 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.490
 repositories is worth it because that too 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.650
 annoying when it comes to updating so 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.020
 guys, we go direct 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.090
 the first repo that I recommend yes or yes 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 what is the lime you have to have in your 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.430
 device esic goÃ¡is repo de ixe 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.190
 likes I love it because it has a lot 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.260
 of themes applications and also has 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 many applications created I think that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 is the repo that more applications created 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 have I do not think any repo has more 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.140
 applications that ixe the jce and the truth 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.630
 is that here I find almost everything 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 and I recommend it, yes or yes, as I said 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.070
 you have is that there is an infinity of 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.950
 applications of sound themes of all 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.409
 is that tsonga would not end 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.240
 and what is said here any application 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.149
 almost any application you want 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.840
 is that is that there are plenty of 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.119
 they the second repo that I recommend is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.009
 he repudiates it and puts before you surely 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.500
 will make this web page which is a 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.600
 news portal and has some reports 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.939
 a few years ago and the truth is 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.729
 I recommend it a lot because apart from 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.110
 have applications created and such a theme of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.670
 such sounds everything has applications 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500
 created but the good thing is that the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 they update very fast at least I've 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.250
 seen that in live on stage always 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
 usually have the latest version of the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.649
 applications instead perhaps in the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.270
 Other repos has the previous version 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.369
 then the dysphonia of almost always 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
 almost always I find the last 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.880
 updated version of the applications 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.829
 created what is very good because 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.060
 example now many applications that 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.950
 are updating to have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.170
 compatibility with the juve 6 of iphone 5 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.489
 the iphone already have encounter and maybe in 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.380
 other rest is the version 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.630
 previous of this application that is only 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 compatible with the contractionary rays and 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.190
 that recommended too 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.200
 in the third place I recommend the one 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.840
 symphony the truth is that I love 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.150
 is also re pons is based on 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.239
 applications created have no subject without 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.870
 sounds like the previous two repos are 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.830
 simply based on applications and twix 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.230
 cracked is worth as you see tubes are 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.049
 trachea two the majority and the truth 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.000
 I recommend a lot I love it as well 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.910
 I said is a type x lite just that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.560
 has applications are worth I love 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.030
 because that's what applications said 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.280
 it is downloaded very fast for example the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.349
 day there was a collapse in all in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 all the rest the ais impulse 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.000
 it worked perfectly they adapted 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.030
 very fast and they also have a great 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.010
 large inventory of applications worth 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.370
 as I said as is the case with iphone 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.079
 you already have many applications I think 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.840
 that they even have some more some 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.940
 specific without full has it and also 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.250
 they have a forum in which you can 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.829
 ask for applications and they can if 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.930
 enter go up to the network then that's 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.849
 great pixels also does it no way 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.650
 that I know does not, but it's a 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.960
 pretty good function and as I said 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.990
 It has quite specific applications 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.800
 that is simple in this report are and in 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.220
 others do not 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.590
 so it's also one to add 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.140
 in penultimate position I recommend to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.360
 jackson which is also from 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
 loaded applications has enough 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.200
 applications after this repo is that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.630
 I have always downloaded with an application 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.460
 it has always worked for me I do not know why 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.180
 but it is the most reliable I believe in my 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.400
 point of view the only thing a little bad is 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.710
 that maybe do not have so many applications 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.530
 nor are they as up-to-date as in the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.780
 other report worth applications there are but 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.760
 if you want the latest versions on 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.500
 all because of what I said because of problems 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.080
 of compatibility the latest version to 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.300
 Sometimes it is necessary then you 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.040
 I recommend the other repos but not for 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.660
 that reason if you have to download this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 network for since for me at my point of 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.160
 opinion is very good as I said has 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.010
 a lot of applications created and it 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.560
 based on that in last position in the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.230
 fifth in Seoul and there I think it's a 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.390
 Very good repo maybe they are not up to standard 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.000
 of the others in terms of applications 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.940
 but have created many issues many 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.220
 tweets of everything has everything 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.250
 between sounds the truth is that there is a 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.370
 great variety I think it is with more 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.890
 variation of content but in the same 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.870
 place so it's one also for 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.900
 download especially if you like the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 issues and twix modifications so 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.090
 It is also one to add and good 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.770
 guys this has been the top 5 repos 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.630
 I hope you liked it if you have 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.820
 Any suggestions in the comments 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.890
 maybe I've left some I think 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.750
 not at least this is my top 5 maybe 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.310
 presents me with a new one that I did not know 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.600
 who had discovered it in the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.280
 comments 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.020
 so if you know of some very good and 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.840
 you recommend a lot in the comments 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.460
 You can leave the usual like if it has 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.980
 liked subscribe if you are not subscribed 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.980
 and see you next video until later
