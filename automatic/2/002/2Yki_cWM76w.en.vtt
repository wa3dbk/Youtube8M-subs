00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello everybody of everything i need and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.719
 in today's river is more fashion then 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.450
 for gta san andreas in a cast of today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's going to be a gta show a new desert he 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 will modify the entire gta san desert 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170
 andreas will add vegetation or 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.230
 be the desert will not be more deserted 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 that's right the way it modifies every part 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.410
 really from the desert bringing the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.630
 ventures is not with you is walking 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.699
 by the images really gets much more 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 Beautiful desert, I prefer it, that way. 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.160
 more beautiful than now it is certainly not more 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 huh 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.300
 but okay so it does not work and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
 not only modifies it're also adds 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.129
 There's a new road in the vicinity there. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 It really makes the module look more beautiful. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.000
 it is heavy well light anyone with good 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 and also does not add just those two 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 things are in the shadow case and places 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.730
 all vegetation by army uniform 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 all right 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.989
 it also adds a shadow type it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.780
 improves the shadow of gta san andreas that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.969
 you will notice in the vehicles on the bike and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 I'm driving there that the bike has a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 Very realistic shade you add this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 also the move is automatically there 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.670
 one thing that I found rather chubby and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.400
 some trees, for example the shade 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 gets well sometimes is not all 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 some only I thought a little 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 disclosed 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 but the rest of the fashion is very good. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
 for who was wanting this way 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.229
 for those who really like graphics 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 better the graphics of the game 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 It's worth it because you crave cef 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 It will be more deserted, it will be much more 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.060
 beautiful, so now it's enough. 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 Let's go and install people now. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.360
 Let's go to the installation is as always. 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.130
 The subscription to the video will be the link 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.689
 way you will lower in extracting and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 also deleting the video will leave a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.030
 link of a video where I show the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 installation of the loader module then 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.689
 here at enrollment 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.159
 watch if you do not have you will 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.229
 have to be there they gta to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.350
 Easily install this template here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.869
 It's because you taking it, you're going to stay. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 much easier to remove install on 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.890
 if so, then that video here 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.600
 If you do not have this video, you will 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 another naked installed after this back 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 here is very easy is here in the description 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.270
 video link so let's go 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.220
 I'm already here then with 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.720
 mold this right here is part of the module is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.770
 very simple installation as I said 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
 for you, right? 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.830
 You're going to copy all this here is copy. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.770
 your folders 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.540
 All this file here copy here 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.100
 remembering that the paste in the mold is not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140
 so now we're going to find a bet 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.240
 of gta san andreas that page which 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 contains all files in gta v 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 locate my voice locates one of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.350
 You, come on, come on, get it all. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
 copy right here in gta san's folder 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.520
 andreas I 've already located here to stay 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.140
 faster here in the video, right? 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.630
 arriving here in her you will see this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.730
 folder here what is the folder so that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.200
 Are you going to watch install in another? 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.920
 video that is here in the description is 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.740
 so I opened this folder here and it glues beauty 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.350
 like the template files you are going to 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.600
 install copy in case not glue here 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.030
 and this was it only 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.470
 is very easy simple is there 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.980
 now I want to remove how I 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.230
 I come here in the same folder and delete 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.380
 these three folders that we put 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.570
 this file deleted it's just removed 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.000
 the mold is very easy're why if 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.070
 moves and that is good the oil side is good by 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.410
 this is because you put the modes that 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.330
 Do you want it later when you want more? 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.030
 I just came here from Christmas the files are 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.920
 It was easy, then, that's it. 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.750
 You can close here then now as always. 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.330

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.790

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.410
