00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
gameplay there this is a just this is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.259 
gameplay there this is a just this is
still<00:02:13.019> an<00:02:13.170> early<00:02:13.260> build<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.920> game<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.430> so

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
still an early build of the game so so

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.390 
still an early build of the game so so
but<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.930> idea<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:20.190> best

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
but you get the idea and then the best

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.789 
but you get the idea and then the best
thing<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.970> my<00:02:21.209> opinion<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.080> we're<00:02:22.350> introducing

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
thing in my opinion is we're introducing

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.610 
thing in my opinion is we're introducing
boss<00:02:23.070> fights<00:02:23.459> should<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.480> liked<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:24.989> but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
boss fights should have liked them but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.560 
boss fights should have liked them but
the<00:02:25.799> main<00:02:25.980> evil<00:02:26.580> characters<00:02:27.120> from<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
the main evil characters from the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.270 
the main evil characters from the
summary<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.230> movie<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.070> actually

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
summary of the movie and you actually

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
summary of the movie and you actually
battle<00:02:29.850> them<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.269> get<00:02:30.450> out<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> really

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
battle them you get out like a really

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.960 
battle them you get out like a really
old-school<00:02:31.650> arcade<00:02:32.340> style<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.450 

it's<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.690> new<00:02:36.810> thing<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.260> us<00:02:37.320> it's<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.070> bit

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's a new thing for us it's a bit

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.710 
it's a new thing for us it's a bit
something<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.970> we've<00:02:39.150> never<00:02:39.300> known<00:02:39.540> before

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
something that we've never known before

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.910 
something that we've never known before
and<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:41.580> think<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.680> suits

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
and we think that it really really suits

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.400 
and we think that it really really suits
the<00:02:44.130> gameplay<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.880> well<00:02:45.060> let<00:02:46.020> me<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.290> try

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
