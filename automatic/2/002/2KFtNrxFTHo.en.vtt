00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 good the purpose of this video these camps to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.770
 about five minutes you can 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.629
 use any particular DSLR 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.629
 guns in fully manual mode 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.490
 good I admit I put the bar a little 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.199
 haughty it's a little competitive at 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.550
 unless I can give you the basics 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.289
 of the photo with three elements 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.760
 important it would be not bad little note 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.470
 fast before starting the video thank you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 to my boyfriend tyloo for lending me his 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 channel for by the demonstrations and the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 following these tutorials will be done in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.680
 live on my switch before being put on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.390
 my channel but I took a little bit of 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 delay with that it will start at the end of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 month or even the beginning of March 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.160
 so suddenly I speak of my switch 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 alesi subscribe it starts to the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
 end of the month about l esi subscribe 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.399
 otherwise I wallowed myself came in them 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 sultry with a cushion each his 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.260
 technique let me peace brief bravo 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 you bought your first dslr very 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.170
 certainly a cannon who are very 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 popular among youtuber to greatly 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 of reason it's super small machine 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 and you will definitely not need 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 to thought for years and you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.239
 can still increase the quality 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 of your videos by simply changing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.180
 the goal 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 keep in mind that your goal is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 80% of your image quality so yes 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.119
 the case obviously affects especially the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 noise level and that kind of things 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.119
 but we're already going into details 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.619
 complicated it's not the purpose of the video 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.000
 finally in three minutes 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 I would like you to master three 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 elements of the photo the iso the singer 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 speed and disrupt it again 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.840
 I use English words by habit 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 and because I think it's better 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 for a lot of reasons that I already have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.500
 explained in lots of videos 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.880
 there are more resources in English on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.009
 internet you want to talk search 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.360
 it's easier short use 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.560
 acronym now that you 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.840
 avoid a waste of time in culture 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.189
 first place the iso also called to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 to be that on some cameras 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 if you see that it's the same thing 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 iso its control actually what is the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.210
 camera is making light that has returned 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.890
 in the sensor once 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.119
 the shutter of the device opens to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.829
 receive light and therefore 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 the information on the world is at the end 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.640
 he interprets it digitally 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 for the dslr and at the time of the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.159
 film you actually bought from 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.020
 small rolls of film with 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.759
 at the already configured on you buy from 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.649
 the film at 200 iso to have 200 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.869
 iso for example it was not changeable 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.340
 in this case as far as I know I will 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.020
 type in comments I feel since 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.159
 the digital age when you change the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.259
 iso it just changes 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.850
 the numerical interpretation of light 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.209
 once that reaches the sensor of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.890
 the device 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.269
 by and large when change tell me oh with 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.980
 the little button on the top on the 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.660
 600d and on the six days is full 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.340
 of haunted devices what is it going to do 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.769
 it is to increase the brightness of your 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.420
 scene the disadvantage of iso is that 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.400
 when you turn to troubles or iso 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.290
 you're going to have that grain label on 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 grain is a kind of small pattern 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.860
 of pretty ugly artifacts on the image that 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.540
 is very easy to spot when we 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.250
 know who is due to the fact that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 the camera really has to cough up the image 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.470
 has its limits to have something 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.120
 visible 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.920
 note as a rule in any case on 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.849
 the channels that if you have to exceed 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.799
 the 800 iso 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.120
 it's usually a little bit 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.680
 too much and you'll do better to alger the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.790
 light to your scene rather than 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.440
 to increase say them high and so 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.390
 of course having had us second 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.769
 element the shooter speed the shooter 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.660
 speed is the speed at which 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.019
 the shutter of the camera will take some 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.489
 imagery 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.379
 again like for these three 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.030
 more items wanted to increase or you the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.829
 descent and more the brightness of the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.239
 scene will change but it hides something 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.889
 to note it's motion blur 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.660
 if you shoot scenes with a lot 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.579
 actions or sudden movements 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.930
 you will see blur in 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.579
 the image every time we make a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.109
 movement which means that your 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.790
 operator is not fast enough 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.250
 if we take an example a speed 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.750
 shutter 1 of 50 will give you 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.950
 a scene that is very bright but 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.780
 which has a lot of motion blur 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 while a shutter speed of 1 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.889
 on 500 will give you a scene a little 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.540
 less luminous but without any blur 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.000
 personal movement I prefer to use a 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.680
 shutter speed between 1250 and 1 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.269
 500 that simply because in effect 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.769
 special tracking business and that 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.910
 it's very hard to follow a point in 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.590
 the scene when everything is completely 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.060
 cloud etc its bubble and in addition to them 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.440
 action videos it's better to have a 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.630
 movement that is super fluid so 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.190
 no blur in the picture so a little 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.990
 speed high enough the last element 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.730
 it's the safe pair we can also see 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.540
 under several names this is the number with 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.790
 a little chef 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.050
 before we call it f stops all that 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.490
 it's the same thing it's bitterness 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.740
 it depends on our purpose is your 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.620
 camera me for example in the hand I 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.350
 a 600d with an 18-55 that I can put 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.210
 at least with 4 and maximum at f25 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.010
 once again the more you increase 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.900
 your aperture the more dark salmonella 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.520
 more wanted to hurt more with miner 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.600
 but that's not all because the 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.860
 urgent loss is also a point 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.050
 Extremely important 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.820
 depth of field or depth of field 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.040
 in English if you are looking on the table 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.360
 the depth of field simply it's 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.040
 this kind of effect you see 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.810
 often at the movies or basically a 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.340
 character is going to be completely honest 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.870
 and the background is going to be completely 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.520
 blur those good parameters that you 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.320
 use it's going more or less advanced at 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.260
 at the possible cost until 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.480
 everything is clean everything is ugly blur and 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 disgusting brief they mistakenly believed 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.220
 speed perceived super simple way 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.550
 the three govern the brightness of the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.560
 scene 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 but the three years when the benefits and 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.020
 their different utility than just doing 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.610
 the light 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.770
 and if you can fiddle with that on 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.330
 your cannon and not you have already won 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.620
 a lot of time especially watching 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.090
 a youtube video of five minutes I 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.710
 have no way proof finish this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.510
 video so I'm going to thank another one 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.180
 time my friendship but lent his canyon 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.380
 game waiting for you on twitch finally from 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.640
 I know that I talk about it a lot 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.930
 right now but it's something I 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.160
 will launch that is important to me 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.380
 because I'm pretty happy with it 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.030
 do it so go ahead 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.530
 please and we end up 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.060
 soon for short films because 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.620
 that's it I'm finally going to have my 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.970
 new pc from here seed a week 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.470
 two and a half weeks I'll start 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.300
 editing videos I made 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.470
 angeles i'm over excited it'll be 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.470
 super cool and that's it hi
