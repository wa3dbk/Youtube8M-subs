00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
earlier on and I bought myself a bit of

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.590 
earlier on and I bought myself a bit of
brass<00:01:55.980> l-shaped<00:01:56.980> it's<00:01:57.310> ten<00:01:57.580> mill<00:01:57.820> by<00:01:58.030> ten<00:01:58.330> mill

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
brass l-shaped it's ten mill by ten mill

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.170 
brass l-shaped it's ten mill by ten mill
and<00:01:59.290> what<00:01:59.440> I'm<00:01:59.560> gonna<00:01:59.680> do<00:01:59.890> now<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.460> I've<00:02:00.880> cut

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
and what I'm gonna do now is I've cut

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.420 
and what I'm gonna do now is I've cut
myself<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.720> new<00:02:01.900> knot<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.409> right<00:02:02.650> size<00:02:03.040> and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
myself a new knot to the right size and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.460 
myself a new knot to the right size and
follow<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.729> grooves<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.600> slots<00:02:04.900> also

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
follow the grooves in the slots also

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.899 
follow the grooves in the slots also
should<00:02:05.770> sound<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.220> lot<00:02:06.340> better<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.700> brass

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
should sound a lot better the brass

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.430 
should sound a lot better the brass
should<00:02:07.210> give<00:02:07.330> me<00:02:07.450> more<00:02:07.630> sustain<00:02:08.080> than<00:02:08.349> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
should give me more sustain than the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.130 
should give me more sustain than the
wood<00:02:08.590> did<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.550> I'm<00:02:09.849> gonna<00:02:09.970> cut<00:02:10.300> it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
wood did so I'm gonna cut it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320 
wood did so I'm gonna cut it
so<00:02:11.800> as<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.400> I've<00:02:12.760> got<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> bridge

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so as you can see I've got the bridge

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.050 
so as you can see I've got the bridge
cut<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.810> length<00:02:13.960> I've<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> nice<00:02:15.460> new<00:02:15.490> pack

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
cut to length I've got a nice new pack

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.850 
cut to length I've got a nice new pack
of<00:02:16.270> diamond<00:02:16.870> needle<00:02:17.230> files

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
of diamond needle files

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.710 
of diamond needle files
they<00:02:18.160> come<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.490> loads<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> different<00:02:18.940> sizes

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
they come in loads of different sizes

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.600 
they come in loads of different sizes
there's<00:02:19.930> about<00:02:20.020> eight<00:02:20.230> different<00:02:20.620> files<00:02:20.890> so

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
there's about eight different files so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
there's about eight different files so
I've<00:02:21.880> got<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> triangular<00:02:22.720> file<00:02:23.050> here<00:02:23.350> and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
I've got a triangular file here and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.980 
I've got a triangular file here and
there's<00:02:23.710> also<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.100> sort<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.490> knife<00:02:24.700> shaped<00:02:25.240> file

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
there's also a sort of knife shaped file

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.320 
there's also a sort of knife shaped file
which<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.440> really<00:02:26.770> useful<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.370> well<00:02:27.640> let's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
which is really useful as well let's

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.660 
which is really useful as well let's
mark<00:02:28.600> out<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.960> string<00:02:29.320> slots<00:02:29.650> first<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
mark out the string slots first the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.580 
mark out the string slots first the
distance<00:02:31.090> across<00:02:31.240> each<00:02:31.870> string<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> e

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
distance across each string to the e

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.100 
distance across each string to the e
string<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> old<00:02:33.460> NHA<00:02:33.760> was<00:02:34.270> forty<00:02:34.630> four<00:02:34.840> mil

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
string on the old NHA was forty four mil

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.250 
string on the old NHA was forty four mil
but<00:02:35.560> if<00:02:35.710> I<00:02:35.860> make<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.250> 45<00:02:36.640> millimeters<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:38.140> if

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
but if I make it 45 millimeters then if

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
but if I make it 45 millimeters then if
you<00:02:38.380> do<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.560> math<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.340> make<00:02:39.520> each<00:02:39.730> string

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you do the math I can make each string

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.750 
you do the math I can make each string
nine<00:02:40.420> millimeters<00:02:41.230> apart<00:02:41.380> next<00:02:42.370> job<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.730> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
nine millimeters apart next job is to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.060 
nine millimeters apart next job is to
mark<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> position<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.930> both<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.500> E<00:02:44.530> string

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
mark the position of both the E string

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.670 
mark the position of both the E string
slots<00:02:45.550> 45<00:02:46.209> millimeters<00:02:46.810> apart<00:02:46.959> onto<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
slots 45 millimeters apart onto the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.770 
slots 45 millimeters apart onto the
brass<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.400> measured<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.940> distance<00:02:49.390> from<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
brass I measured the distance from the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.140 
brass I measured the distance from the
ends<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.560> mark<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.160> E<00:02:51.190> string<00:02:51.700> slots

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
ends of the mark to the E string slots

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.180 
ends of the mark to the E string slots
so<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:52.840> an<00:02:52.930> equal<00:02:53.200> distance<00:02:53.530> from<00:02:53.650> both<00:02:53.920> ends

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
so it's an equal distance from both ends

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.280 
so it's an equal distance from both ends
and<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.610> centered<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.870> gonna<00:02:56.080> actually

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and it's centered I'm gonna actually

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.040 
and it's centered I'm gonna actually
mark<00:02:56.650> off<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.220> 9<00:02:57.400> millimeter<00:02:57.670> spices<00:02:58.540> now<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
mark off the 9 millimeter spices now and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.729 
mark off the 9 millimeter spices now and
make<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> not<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:04.000> bit<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.600> patience<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.380> get

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
make the not so bit of patience you get

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.300 
make the not so bit of patience you get
there<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:08.230> it's<00:03:08.350> really<00:03:08.500> enjoyable<00:03:09.010> doing

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
there but it's really enjoyable doing

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.890 
there but it's really enjoyable doing
this<00:03:09.430> sort<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.730> job<00:03:09.970> as<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.630> see<00:03:10.810> I've

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
this sort of job as you can see I've

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.410 
this sort of job as you can see I've
made<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.440> six<00:03:11.800> marks<00:03:12.310> at<00:03:12.520> nine<00:03:12.700> millimeters

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
made the six marks at nine millimeters

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.199 
made the six marks at nine millimeters
with<00:03:14.080> my<00:03:14.260> foil<00:03:14.620> that's<00:03:15.430> gonna<00:03:15.640> be<00:03:15.790> for<00:03:16.000> fatty

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
with my foil that's gonna be for fatty

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.180 
with my foil that's gonna be for fatty
and<00:03:16.660> that's<00:03:16.959> gonna<00:03:17.170> be<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.560> thinny<00:03:17.769> now

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and that's gonna be for the thinny now

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.560 
and that's gonna be for the thinny now
I've<00:03:18.370> just<00:03:18.400> got<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.760> make<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> slots<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.420> bit

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
I've just got to make the slots a bit

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.660 
I've just got to make the slots a bit
bigger<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.230> work<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.100> just<00:03:21.340> take<00:03:21.549> them

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
bigger and work on it and just take them

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.000 
bigger and work on it and just take them
down<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> bit<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.209> depth<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.560> doesn't<00:03:23.860> take

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
down a bit in depth so it doesn't take

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.250 
down a bit in depth so it doesn't take
long<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.970> I've<00:03:25.090> been<00:03:25.180> at<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.480> five<00:03:26.019> minutes

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
long what I've been at it five minutes

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
bead the G and the D one of the things

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.910 
bead the G and the D one of the things
about<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.090> nut<00:03:31.330> that<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.600> bought<00:03:31.870> online<00:03:32.320> fake

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
about the nut that I bought online fake

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.360 
about the nut that I bought online fake
quid<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.510> can<00:03:34.630> see<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.989> slot<00:03:35.350> well<00:03:36.160> they

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
quid is you can see the slot well they

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.220 
quid is you can see the slot well they
would<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.580> same<00:03:36.880> depth<00:03:37.269> which<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.780> really

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
would have same depth which is really

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.550 
would have same depth which is really
crap<00:03:38.560> because<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.000> fatty<00:03:40.440> obviously<00:03:41.440> will

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
crap because the fatty obviously will

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.470 
crap because the fatty obviously will
sit<00:03:41.830> higher<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.459> than<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.820> thinny<00:03:43.090> which

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
sit higher up than the thinny which

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600 
sit higher up than the thinny which
means<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.930> strings<00:03:44.320> will<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.620> sloped<00:03:45.100> you

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
means the strings will be sloped you

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.920 
means the strings will be sloped you
really<00:03:45.850> want<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.390> have<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.660> gross

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
really want this to have to gross

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.380 
really want this to have to gross
different<00:03:47.410> sizes<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> strings<00:03:48.640> sit<00:03:49.060> flat

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
different sizes so the strings sit flat

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.900 
different sizes so the strings sit flat
and<00:03:49.450> even<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.320> can<00:03:50.440> bar<00:03:50.650> them<00:03:50.920> easily<00:03:51.130> so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
and even so you can bar them easily so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.850 
and even so you can bar them easily so
I've<00:03:52.030> got<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.450> slightly<00:03:52.780> larger<00:03:53.049> groove<00:03:53.500> there

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
I've got a slightly larger groove there

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.860 
I've got a slightly larger groove there
that<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.489> fit<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.940> tip<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.390> file<00:03:55.600> in

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
that you can fit the tip of the file in

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.050 
that you can fit the tip of the file in
there<00:03:56.080> virtually<00:03:56.290> whereas<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.160> one's<00:03:57.459> got

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
there virtually whereas that one's got

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.330 
there virtually whereas that one's got
shout<00:03:58.480> out<00:03:58.660> for<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.140> thinny<00:03:59.530> but<00:04:00.070> yeah

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
shout out for the thinny but yeah

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.670 
shout out for the thinny but yeah
purposively<00:04:01.000> larger<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.930> reckon<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.470> a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
purposively larger so I reckon that's a

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.949 
purposively larger so I reckon that's a
good<00:04:02.950> start<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.970> basically<00:04:04.360> needs<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.840> be

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
good start it basically needs to be

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.680 
good start it basically needs to be
fitted<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.950> slide<00:04:06.220> guitar<00:04:06.400> now<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.239> must

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
fitted to the slide guitar now I must

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.569 
fitted to the slide guitar now I must
drill<00:04:07.989> those<00:04:08.230> two<00:04:08.560> holes<00:04:08.769> there<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.340> we<00:04:09.430> can

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
drill those two holes there so we can

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.510 
drill those two holes there so we can
mount<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.970> up

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
mount it up

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.030 
mount it up
I've<00:04:12.450> got<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> two<00:04:12.870> screw<00:04:13.260> holes<00:04:13.290> drilled

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I've got the two screw holes drilled

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.920 
I've got the two screw holes drilled
there<00:04:14.310> before<00:04:14.850> Eddie<00:04:14.970> got<00:04:15.120> some<00:04:15.300> strings<00:04:15.660> on

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
there before Eddie got some strings on

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.110 
there before Eddie got some strings on
obviously<00:04:16.680> I'm<00:04:16.770> gonna<00:04:16.860> change<00:04:17.220> strings<00:04:17.670> but

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
obviously I'm gonna change strings but

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.940 
obviously I'm gonna change strings but
let's<00:04:18.630> just<00:04:18.870> try<00:04:19.050> and<00:04:19.110> get<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> nut<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.680> first

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
let's just try and get the nut in first

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.920 
let's just try and get the nut in first
to<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.310> what's<00:04:20.459> going<00:04:20.790> on<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.540> I've<00:04:21.660> only<00:04:21.780> gone

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
to see what's going on so I've only gone

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.260 
to see what's going on so I've only gone
down<00:04:21.989> half<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.500> mil<00:04:22.650> anyway<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.850> there's<00:04:24.030> plenty

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
down half a mil anyway so there's plenty

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.300 
down half a mil anyway so there's plenty
of<00:04:24.510> room<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.290> course<00:04:25.470> I've<00:04:25.560> got<00:04:25.590> files<00:04:26.010> so

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
of room and of course I've got files so

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.550 
of room and of course I've got files so
I<00:04:26.370> can<00:04:26.520> easily<00:04:26.640> correct<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.270> deck<00:04:27.560> well

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
I can easily correct the deck well

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.130 
I can easily correct the deck well
that's<00:04:28.740> absolutely<00:04:29.310> Parker<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.480> first<00:04:30.810> look

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
that's absolutely Parker of first look

the Easter who needs to go down ahead of

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.330 
the Easter who needs to go down ahead of
a<00:04:33.420> lot<00:04:33.570> more<00:04:33.600> don't<00:04:34.500> take<00:04:34.710> him<00:04:34.890> off<00:04:35.010> at<00:04:35.130> one

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
a lot more don't take him off at one

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.850 
a lot more don't take him off at one
time<00:04:35.580> just<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> few<00:04:36.480> wipes<00:04:37.020> there<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.680> go

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
time just a few wipes there you go

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.190 
time just a few wipes there you go
that's<00:04:38.550> much<00:04:38.850> better<00:04:39.120> sitting<00:04:39.690> down<00:04:39.900> the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
that's much better sitting down the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.090 
that's much better sitting down the
grooves<00:04:40.470> now<00:04:40.760> ice<00:04:41.760> tree<00:04:42.300> needs<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.600> bit<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> work

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
grooves now ice tree needs a bit of work

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.280 
grooves now ice tree needs a bit of work
let's<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.340> do<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.640> same<00:04:44.850> with<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.270> but<00:04:46.260> a

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
slope on the back that the distri vv5

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.930 
slope on the back that the distri vv5
