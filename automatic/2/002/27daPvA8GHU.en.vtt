00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.469
 there were threats of 20 thousand 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 threatened by 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.849
 my address is regularly received last 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.140
 two years 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.060
 they were on the phone were carried on 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.109
 this 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.399
 it is known that this is not the first attack on 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.119
 the post was held blindly 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 success 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.249
 these are the results 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.449
 but this attack was to play this attack 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.120
 already have children 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.030
 I think that all these actions are one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.690
 of the reasons 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.960
 probably not one of them was investigated 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.240
 accordingly it may affect 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.550
 the behavior will be gone 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.720
 until the end of the investigation 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 Tambov fact 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.620
 committed crime 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.220
 I think soon excited 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.310
 criminal case 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.730
 pr bobrov g 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 I doubt that there will be any 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 results for the reason that 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.180
 honored people who are current 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.970
 a few weeks have opened 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 theoretically ipad on the Baksan HES 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.850
 they were able to uncover a single attack 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.829
 on public figures 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.060
 in the republic 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.820
 which occurred 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.460
 over the past five years if you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.630
 assumptions who for what and why could 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.660
 make an attack 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.570
 n all sorts of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.520
 sex crime circles 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.310
 the one for little money 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 can 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.200
 even if such shares unfortunately here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.140
 in the republic mayor 43 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 but it is an irritant 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.470
 I think when to decide 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.670
 and without precise definition 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.259
 your social organization 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.040
 issued a statement 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.390
 consciously because with the conduct 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.450
 conference 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.340
 is it so with us all the time 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.830
 what provocations happen 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.869
 private land legal 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.579
 relationship 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.529
 and in order to 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.819
 close this problem once and for all 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.909
 in order to start a dialogue between 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.639
 if nationality 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.349
 and ethnic groups 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.299
 why are you 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.609
 people's diplomacy has always been on 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.909
 Caucasus figures them this time 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.260
 disagreement relationship 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.269
 we decided 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.299
 really start this conference and start 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.659
 dialogue 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.189
 between these clubs 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.230

 and the council discussed the balkar people with 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.299
 Cossack community 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.409
 met with communist leaders recession 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.649
 Kiev and the waters of Russia 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.639
 if you have villages nii Russians spoke 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.729
 over the summer conference support 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.729
 I think this conference 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.049
 Gomel residents did not allow those who are not 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.539
 were interested in the percentage of such 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.069
 relationship 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.569
 in nationality 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.569
 lecture to residents 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.369
 whether the plant will be decisive for 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.209
 stabilization of the situation 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.759
 ride a rollercoaster 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.369
 Ria question section news is not 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.239

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.889
 now was not long ago 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.229
 percentage of the republicâ€™s residents 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.819
 security guarantees 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.609
 and it is very important 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.419
 rub if republic authorities found 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.419

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.729
 public places of sight 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.529
 then protest moods which 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.239
 here is simple brand new
