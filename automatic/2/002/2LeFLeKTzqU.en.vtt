00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
hop on the apex bandwagon and they're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.270 
hop on the apex bandwagon and they're
actually<00:02:12.320> developing<00:02:12.530> apps<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.160> the

actually developing apps for the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.880 
actually developing apps for the
platform<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.240> recommend<00:02:15.020> keeping<00:02:15.170> tabs<00:02:15.620> on

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
platform so I recommend keeping tabs on

platform so I recommend keeping tabs on
these<00:02:16.040> themes<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.330> developers<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.900> are

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
these themes and the developers that are

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.870 
these themes and the developers that are
doing<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.520> lot<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.670> themes

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
doing it because I think a lot of themes

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.700 
doing it because I think a lot of themes
will<00:02:20.060> be<00:02:20.150> coming<00:02:20.480> up<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.320> Apex

Nova so you can kind of do a
cross-platform<00:03:13.220> test<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.150> see<00:03:14.690> which<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.140> the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
cross-platform test and see which is the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.320 
cross-platform test and see which is the
