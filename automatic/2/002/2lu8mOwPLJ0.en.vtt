00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.649
 hi everyone the two machines 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.320
 so today I'm showing you the 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.070
 Following my guy keenan tae-yong that 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.830
 I called jack 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.610
 so I bought him jeans that I 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.640
 let's show you so that was on 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.290
 ebay june to 2 3 jean not too expensive time 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 that it was at 5 euros the three jeans 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.130
 so I took advantage 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.300
 but I do not like it because 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.230
 it is a little shiny glittery kind 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.760
 people prefer that they be more 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.650
 but it did not show on the pictures and 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.140
 I think it's a bit too wide 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.750
 that's it then if not what I did I 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.070
 bought a cheap doll from high 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.170
 school so I do not like this at all 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.630
 doll of course but it's for 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.370
 recover the shirt and the tie 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.590
 so I'll open it that cost 6 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.670
 euros so I said he bought it and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.670
 I'm going to put him will show you 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.680
 so that's what it gives so it has a 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.989
 white shirt with a red tie 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880
 does it come off with a scratch 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.140
 behind these practices to put in 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.970
 there's just getting hands to 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.990
 to be able to put on the sleeves 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.650
 in just a little 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.960
 this is not it's not very suitable for 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 this type of dolls as you can 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.020
 far is it for fashion dolls 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.750
 like that so the jeans ba it's going and in 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.850
 do the converses it's going great with 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.680
 the red color of the tie so I 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.930
 shows you how it's done so that's it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 the first outfit actually so if I 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.690
 see other opportunities with 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.750
 barbie ken clothes 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.590
 if his life goes this will be great so there 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.049
 I like this style 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.619
 that's simple but I like 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.240
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.100
 rained in fact he just told me to cut 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.450
 and eyelashes now because they are 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 too long as you said it's 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.900
 sure it's not going at all I've hurt them 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.060
 stuck in more I do not want to re 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.770
 actually disassembled his face other than 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.939
 it's a bit long here I have a little 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
 lazy so I just have the cuts and 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.369
 really i think sarah what i have 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.320
 cut in half in fact this case that makes 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.780
 really too feminine I do not like it at all 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.860
 not at all so thank you for having 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.549

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.549
