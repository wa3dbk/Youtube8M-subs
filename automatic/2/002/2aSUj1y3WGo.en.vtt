00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.190
 Small introduction 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.190
 of what the game would be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.320
 will return to the hunters this is about 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.320
 that you are a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.890
 the objectives 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.630
 a kind of closure that is running 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.760
 the hunters who obviously got it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.760
 they want to eat and serve as a scene 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.890

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.680

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.729
 nico marquez he sent a greeting to the day 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.430
 this video as good value is the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.830
 gameplay of this game the game in the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.060
 accelerometer and to my mind it's better 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.740
 that this dog already does not have much and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.289
 nothing of that and runs perfectly 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.060
 our security 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.329
 and not just because he runs in our 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.690
 cellular but it's better in graphics and 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.270
 everything so it 's very good 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.760
 look and see I say good let's be a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.950
 Well it convinces them obviously 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 soon and then through the game 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.210
 they are and garzon to the states and they are still 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.430
 attentive to what they like 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.980
 it knows the sun and since it is very 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.430
 good for those who do not know it's about 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.430
 careers 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.189

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.500
