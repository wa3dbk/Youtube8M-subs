00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
makes it shiny versus not so shiny let's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
makes it shiny versus not so shiny let's
begin<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.500> tested<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.039> bolt<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
begin so I tested this bolt out with to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
begin so I tested this bolt out with to
market<00:00:30.689> first<00:00:30.869> off<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> empire<00:00:31.650> axe<00:00:31.949> ii<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
market first off the empire axe ii the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.810 
market first off the empire axe ii the
defendant<00:00:33.480> i<00:00:36.500> also<00:00:37.500> used<00:00:37.829> two<00:00:38.219> different

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
defendant i also used two different

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
defendant i also used two different
types<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.149> things<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.420> us<00:00:39.540> being<00:00:39.899> heat<00:00:40.200> second

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
types of things for us being heat second

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.799 
types of things for us being heat second
one<00:00:40.680> being<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.790> old<00:00:41.940> ultra<00:00:42.480> evil

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
one being some really old ultra evil

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.779 
one being some really old ultra evil
that<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.989> had<00:00:43.200> lying<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.309> figure<00:00:44.610> if

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that I had lying around and I figure if

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
that I had lying around and I figure if
he<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.090> shoot<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> it'll<00:00:46.079> shoot<00:00:46.200> anything

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
he can shoot that it'll shoot anything

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
he can shoot that it'll shoot anything
so<00:00:47.010> that's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.730> good<00:00:47.850> benchmark<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.960> does

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so that's a good benchmark so what does

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
so that's a good benchmark so what does

sits much farther back in the breach as

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.910 
sits much farther back in the breach as
room<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> wiggle<00:01:52.830> around

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.420 

and<00:01:59.420> that<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.600> much<00:02:01.080> quieter<00:02:01.500> than<00:02:02.280> the

and that it is much quieter than the
stock<00:02:02.700> bolt<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> did<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.870> I<00:02:03.960> shot<00:02:04.170> both

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
stock bolt so what I did was I shot both

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.090 
stock bolt so what I did was I shot both
types<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.950> paint<00:02:05.220> through<00:02:05.850> both<00:02:06.300> markers

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
types of paint through both markers

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.300 
types of paint through both markers
using<00:02:08.100> both<00:02:08.759> bolts<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.590> videoed<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.009> chair

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
using both bolts and videoed and chair

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
of the truck I figured this would be the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.780 
of the truck I figured this would be the
best<00:03:31.769> benchmark<00:03:32.549> that's<00:03:33.329> with<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:35.400> really

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
best benchmark that's with I have really

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.970 
best benchmark that's with I have really
consistent<00:03:36.450> crona's<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.230> give<00:03:37.680> plus

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
consistent crona's with this give plus

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.090 
consistent crona's with this give plus
or<00:03:38.160> minus<00:03:38.430> three<00:03:38.790> well<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:40.049> conclusion<00:03:40.440> let's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
or minus three well in conclusion let's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.530 
or minus three well in conclusion let's
answer<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.610> question<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.120> everyone<00:03:42.390> is
