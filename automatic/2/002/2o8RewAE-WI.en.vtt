00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
have been a piece they would have

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.459 
have been a piece they would have
brought<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.170> them<00:01:12.020> there<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.290> a

dramatic photograph of horses on Sable

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
dramatic photograph of horses on Sable
Island<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> thought<00:01:20.189> again<00:01:20.490> was

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
Island that I thought again was

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
Island that I thought again was
something<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.719> piece<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
something that you know a piece that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
something that you know a piece that
they<00:01:22.560> purchased<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.520> maybe<00:01:23.759> they

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they purchased and that maybe they

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:24.980 
they purchased and that maybe they
didn't<00:01:24.090> even<00:01:24.149> know<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.329> to<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
didn't even know what to do with it

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
didn't even know what to do with it
didn't<00:01:25.289> fit<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> house<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.340> Beaufort

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
didn't fit in in the house and Beaufort

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
didn't fit in in the house and Beaufort
and<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.719> was<00:01:27.899> like<00:01:28.079> almost<00:01:28.259> maybe

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and and so this was like almost maybe

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.649 
and and so this was like almost maybe
the<00:01:28.740> reason<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.070> bought<00:01:29.219> this<00:01:29.399> apartment<00:01:29.659> so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the reason they bought this apartment so

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.880 
the reason they bought this apartment so
they<00:01:30.780> could<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.109> find<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.469> home<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.799> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
they could actually find a home for this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.880 
they could actually find a home for this
piece<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.600> then<00:01:33.600> beyond<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.079> there's<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
piece and then beyond that there's a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.529 
piece and then beyond that there's a
space<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.820> next<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> kitchen

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
space that that's next to the kitchen

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.230 
space that that's next to the kitchen
that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.770> transition<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.340> stair<00:01:39.060> Hall

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that is the transition from stair Hall

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.950 
that is the transition from stair Hall
to<00:01:39.479> living<00:01:40.079> space<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:42.030> made<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.689> sort

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to living space so I made that in sort

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.600 
to living space so I made that in sort
of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.109> bar<00:01:43.320> area

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.910 

and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.810> course<00:01:46.870> you're<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.500> guess<00:01:47.800> it

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
and then of course you're in I guess it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
were in that mode it would work

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
theater but I also wanted it to be the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.390 
theater but I also wanted it to be the
kind<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.870> thing<00:02:08.050> where<00:02:08.230> you<00:02:08.530> know<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:09.010> could<00:02:09.040> be

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
kind of thing where you know it could be

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.040

sort<00:02:09.760> of<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.940> after<00:02:10.360> party<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:13.990> a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
sort of the after party because it's a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.360 
sort of the after party because it's a
very<00:02:14.230> modern<00:02:14.440> apartment<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.010> doesn't<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
very modern apartment it doesn't have a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.600 
very modern apartment it doesn't have a
lot<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.580> architectural<00:02:16.270> details<00:02:16.840> very<00:02:17.080> simple

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
lot of architectural details very simple

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.760 
lot of architectural details very simple
so<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.880> heard<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> space<00:02:20.020> with<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> really

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
so I heard the space with a really

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.890 
so I heard the space with a really
beautiful<00:02:21.090> antique<00:02:22.090> French<00:02:22.360> cabinet<00:02:22.660> from

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
beautiful antique French cabinet from

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.700 
beautiful antique French cabinet from
Amy<00:02:23.080> purlins

Amy purlins

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.390 
Amy purlins
I<00:02:24.180> also<00:02:25.180> define<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.960> space<00:02:26.200> with<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> bell<00:02:27.130> jar

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
I also define the space with a bell jar

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I also define the space with a bell jar
an<00:02:27.730> oversized<00:02:28.210> bell<00:02:28.570> jar<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:30.180> again<00:02:31.180> it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
an oversized bell jar that again it

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.490 
an oversized bell jar that again it
looks<00:02:31.600> like<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.900> almost<00:02:32.020> took<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.320> off<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
looks like you almost took it off the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.620 
looks like you almost took it off the
front<00:02:32.830> porch<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.370> their<00:02:33.850> house<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.270> Beaufort

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
front porch of their house and Beaufort

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.150 
front porch of their house and Beaufort
going<00:02:37.630> up<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.020> stairs<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.500> thought<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:38.950> is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
going up the stairs I thought this is

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.470 
going up the stairs I thought this is
the<00:02:39.310> moment<00:02:39.490> where<00:02:39.700> you're<00:02:39.820> entering<00:02:40.240> into

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the moment where you're entering into

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.050 
the moment where you're entering into
the<00:02:41.320> private<00:02:41.740> space<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.250> Cooper's<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the private space of the Cooper's so I

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.820 
the private space of the Cooper's so I
wanted<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.690> almost<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.080> like<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.710> the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
wanted it to almost be like this is the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.390 
wanted it to almost be like this is the
area<00:02:45.130> where<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.500> experiencing<00:02:47.500> both<00:02:48.070> of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
area where you are experiencing both of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.790 
area where you are experiencing both of
them<00:02:48.730> then<00:02:49.720> when<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.930> go<00:02:50.080> into<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.650> bedroom

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
them then when you go into the bedroom

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.430 
them then when you go into the bedroom

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
you have this you know the space that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
you have this you know the space that
originally<00:02:54.370> got<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.790> didn't<00:02:55.060> feel<00:02:55.239> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
originally got it it didn't feel that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.310 
originally got it it didn't feel that
big<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.550> took<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.910> detail<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.330> was<00:02:58.630> given<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.230> us

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
big I took a detail that was given to us

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.199 
big I took a detail that was given to us
you<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.650> we<00:03:00.130> inherited<00:03:00.610> from<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.880> building

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
you know we inherited from the building

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.810 
you know we inherited from the building
which<00:03:01.810> was<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.050> baseboard<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:03.250> used<00:03:03.580> those

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
which was the baseboard and I used those

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.690 
which was the baseboard and I used those
details<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.540> create<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> wood<00:03:05.500> bat<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.430> that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
details to create a wood bat and that

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.220 
details to create a wood bat and that
actually<00:03:07.120> divided<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.720> room<00:03:07.870> into

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
actually divided the room into

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.290 
actually divided the room into
horizontal<00:03:08.770> bands<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.489> sort<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.850> balanced<00:03:10.180> out

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
horizontal bands it sort of balanced out

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300 
horizontal bands it sort of balanced out
the<00:03:10.330> tall<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.140> width<00:03:11.590> which<00:03:12.130> was

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the tall with the width which was

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.979 
the tall with the width which was
important<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.820> also<00:03:12.970> gave<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.450> space<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> sense

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
important it also gave the space a sense

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.550 
important it also gave the space a sense
of<00:03:14.080> architecture<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:15.600> think<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.780> each<00:03:17.170> space

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
of architecture I think that each space

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.130 
of architecture I think that each space
has<00:03:17.860> sort<00:03:18.520> of<00:03:18.580> modern<00:03:18.940> moment<00:03:19.390> sort<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.110> a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
has sort of modern moment sort of a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.490 
has sort of modern moment sort of a
nostalgic<00:03:21.040> moment<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:22.080> feel<00:03:23.080> like<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.320> is

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
nostalgic moment I feel like this is

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.460 
nostalgic moment I feel like this is
their<00:03:23.650> time<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.360> utilize<00:03:25.720> this

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
their time to to really utilize this

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.900 
their time to to really utilize this
space<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:26.980> little<00:03:27.280> bit<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.730> laboratory

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
space is a little bit of a laboratory

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.440 
space is a little bit of a laboratory
for<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.510> next<00:03:28.870> stage<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.680> their<00:03:29.860> lives

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
for the next stage of their lives

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.510 
for the next stage of their lives
