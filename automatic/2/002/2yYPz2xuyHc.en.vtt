now<00:00:05.210> that<00:00:05.390> we've<00:00:05.510> processed<00:00:05.779> our<00:00:06.170> fuel<00:00:07.009> wood

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
now that we've processed our fuel wood

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.950 
now that we've processed our fuel wood
now<00:00:07.820> we're<00:00:08.059> going<00:00:08.180> to<00:00:08.240> have<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:08.480> start<00:00:08.719> a<00:00:08.809> fire

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
now we're going to have to start a fire

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.779 
now we're going to have to start a fire
in<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.260> stove<00:00:09.440> now<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.130> technique<00:00:10.580> that<00:00:10.610> I

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:10.789 
in the stove now the technique that I

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.279 
in the stove now the technique that I
have<00:00:11.059> here<00:00:11.299> is<00:00:11.539> a<00:00:11.570> technique<00:00:12.020> that<00:00:12.080> I've

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.289 
have here is a technique that I've

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:13.480 
have here is a technique that I've
learned<00:00:12.530> and<00:00:12.740> developed<00:00:13.160> over<00:00:13.369> the<00:00:13.459> years

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
learned and developed over the years

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.930 
learned and developed over the years
that<00:00:13.760> I've<00:00:13.910> found<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:14.570> get<00:00:14.959> the<00:00:15.170> fast<00:00:15.980> warming

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
that I've found to get the fast warming

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.330 
that I've found to get the fast warming
drying<00:00:17.240> fire<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:18.020> quickest<00:00:18.439> with<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.160> least

drying fire the quickest with the least
amount<00:00:19.519> of<00:00:19.730> effort<00:00:19.880> possible<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:21.199> that<00:00:21.890> works

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
amount of effort possible and that works

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.490 
amount of effort possible and that works
really<00:00:22.609> really<00:00:22.730> well<00:00:23.060> now<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.839> lot<00:00:24.109> of<00:00:24.230> people

three pieces of wood the bottom fingers
with<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.830> part<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.299> bottom<00:01:50.570> of<00:01:50.659> my<00:01:50.690> firebox

with a part in the bottom of my firebox
okay<00:01:53.140> then<00:01:54.140> I'll<00:01:54.470> put<00:01:57.940> I'll<00:01:58.940> shift<00:01:59.780> this<00:02:00.020> next

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
okay then I'll put I'll shift this next

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.609 
okay then I'll put I'll shift this next
layer<00:02:01.070> no<00:02:01.549> about<00:02:01.820> 10<00:02:02.119> degrees<00:02:02.240> over<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.500> the

and then I'll put another layer to the
right<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.780> reason<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:17.160> wood<00:02:17.310> is

but far enough apart towards it allow
the<00:02:22.260> oxygen<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:24.000> go<00:02:24.180> around<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.230> wood<00:02:27.350> next

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350

this<00:04:42.920> technique<00:04:43.370> as<00:04:43.610> these<00:04:44.240> species<00:04:44.540> burn<00:04:45.020> up

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
this technique as these species burn up

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.290 
this technique as these species burn up
and<00:04:45.410> start<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.800> fall<00:04:45.980> in<00:04:46.130> between<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.120> three

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
and start to fall in between the three

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.260 
and start to fall in between the three
foundation<00:04:48.140> pieces<00:04:48.920> of<00:04:49.190> wood<00:04:49.370> those<00:04:50.060> will

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
foundation pieces of wood those will

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.210 
foundation pieces of wood those will
start<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.600> burn<00:04:50.810> make<00:04:51.200> you<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> good<00:04:51.560> bit<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:51.980> ash

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
start to burn make you a good bit of ash

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.160 
start to burn make you a good bit of ash
on<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.490> bottom<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.480> create<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.750> good<00:04:53.960> bit<00:04:54.140> of
