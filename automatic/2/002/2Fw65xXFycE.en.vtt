00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.359
 then the aegon future journal of this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 week with the b1 of ajax at home 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.700
 against FC Utrecht B1 but first the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.679
 city â€‹â€‹derby between ajax d1 and afc d1 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.560
 with here the first big chance of the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.270
 competition by Willem Baars 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.289
 but it's brian carrying that rescue 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.289
 brings for hfc 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 it would be the match of the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.189
 missed opportunities here again perch 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
 Willem Barth again only wore off and on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 in the rebound it is a 0 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.450
 for ajax chimp first this will be there 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.969
 but otherwise had both 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 plowing problems in the completion 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 in the second half ac loses the ball 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 they then ajax them to ledge and margaret 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.879
 quick out with jamie here leonel jamie 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.930
 who attracts him before Willem has the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.460
 ball I just hit him next to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.460
 four hands of the goalkeeper 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 hfc then 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.830
 good attack 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.910
 the laying back van der wiel lays 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.970
 a broad 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.900
 good shot there from jayden ck makes it 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.190
 a cops 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:28.190
 if ajax is on his post , then with you 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.200
 baker baker with the cross 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.340
 well done this ball must be put back 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.340
 that does not happen 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 and then soot the ball has the bet of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.630
 boss again 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.450
 castillo action in the 16 meter 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.950
 ball seems to be eliminated that 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.890
 does not happen well ajax continues 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.060
 sulaiman and here baker who attracts him 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.729
 in front of 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 and here bass and again but it touches 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.979
 him completely wrong 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.720
 fortunately the audience can laugh about it 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.510
 because despite the missed opportunities it was 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.130
 a very entertaining competition 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.080
 between ajax and fc 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.709
 here the last chance of the match they 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.300
 gio test shoots next 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.590
 and that's how it ends up with one 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.270
 zero 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.470
 between the team of Kazimir Westerveld 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.940
 or ajax d1 and hcd one 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.250
 then a Sunday game at the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.230
 future ajax b1 against fc utrecht b1 a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.260
 nice competition with a nice page here 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 of f malfoy on nuri nuri during rush hour 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.510
 but he shoots Barry van de Brink 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.310
 nice pass from f for files and the big one 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.110
 chance the first real of the competition 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.630
 for nuri here the supplier 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.130
 jordy brown small in size good ball 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.200
 dekker 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 just too little powerful was behind the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.980
 get the ball and therefore barring again 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 green 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.090
 holland it rests full of clues 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.500
 this is the 2nd half when the corner comes from 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.240
 is taken by brown 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.740
 here nuri does not hit the ball completely 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.700
 tasty but utrecht gets him that too 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.970
 road surfaces then 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.220
 flaming shot with left he has such 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.880
 good kick and vingino dekker but 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.330
 this time 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.900
 he finds no purpose here again brown 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.390
 brown action is good shot with the soft 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.850
 again the goalkeeper of utrecht ajax 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.390
 first at home against b1 of 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.390
 utrecht 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.600
 but there are the old ones 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.520
 you don't make football laws yourself 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.330
 an opponent scores and that goes here 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.000
 also happen 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.140
 admittedly in a wonderful way what a 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.140
 goal from fc utrecht 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.200
 a great goal from antonie 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.690
 beresteyn unlikely exterior 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.550
 left in the far corner in that big one 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.150
 Homes has no chance of betting 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.150
 beresteyn 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.709
 and then the b1 is just behind 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.000
 absolutely unnecessary nuri 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.190
 like hunting for the evening 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.830
 that comes here peeling neatly 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.739
 assumption and well-rounded with left on 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.739
 the beautiful purple of nuri well done 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.730
 from nuri 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.070
 and of course also klement then 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.390
 a great opportunity but it will be here 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.450
 flagged 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.680
 client is the van by in the final phase of 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.300
 the match 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.980
 and that turned out to be absolutely wrong 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.340
 his just look in the center the 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.030
 defender but becomes 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.919
 called back 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.919
 and so , the game ended in one
