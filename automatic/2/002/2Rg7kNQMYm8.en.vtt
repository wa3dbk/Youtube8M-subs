class sitting in a in a museum and
sketch<00:02:19.550> those<00:02:19.760> cars<00:02:20.120> sometimes<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.260> whole

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
sketch those cars sometimes the whole

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.470 
sketch those cars sometimes the whole
car<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.799> sometimes<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.430> too<00:02:22.610> details<00:02:23.030> but

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
car is sometimes just too details but

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.630 
car is sometimes just too details but
you<00:02:24.200> know<00:02:24.319> just<00:02:24.590> even<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.980> door<00:02:25.160> handle<00:02:25.549> is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
you know just even the door handle is

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.420 
you know just even the door handle is
our<00:02:25.819> piece<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.140> it'd<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.440> great<00:02:27.590> education

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
our piece so it'd be a great education

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.550 
our piece so it'd be a great education
piece<00:02:28.640> can<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.630> tell<00:02:29.840> me<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.959> little<00:02:30.019> bit<00:02:30.290> about

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
piece can you tell me a little bit about

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440 
piece can you tell me a little bit about
what<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.700> you're<00:02:31.819> doing<00:02:32.090> within<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
what what you're doing within the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.820 
what what you're doing within the
program<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.080> now<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.500> industrial

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
program right now in the industrial

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.320 
program right now in the industrial
design<00:02:33.980> program<00:02:34.130> are<00:02:34.459> there<00:02:34.549> innovations<00:02:35.180> in

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
design program are there innovations in

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.210 
design program are there innovations in
terms<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.660> automobile<00:02:36.140> design<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:37.010> you're

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
terms of automobile design that you're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
terms of automobile design that you're
exploring<00:02:37.459> with<00:02:37.819> your<00:02:37.940> students<00:02:38.390> always<00:02:39.049> do

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
exploring with your students always do

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.830 
exploring with your students always do
you<00:02:39.890> know<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.269> manufacture<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.390> only<00:02:41.660> do

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you know the manufacture you only do

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.259 
you know the manufacture you only do
like<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.049> five<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.650> say<00:02:43.040> ten<00:02:43.340> years<00:02:43.610> ahead<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
like a five to say ten years ahead the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.350 
like a five to say ten years ahead the
advanced<00:02:45.049> design<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.680> about<00:02:45.890> 10<00:02:46.400> years<00:02:46.610> so

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
advanced design is about 10 years so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.360 
advanced design is about 10 years so
school<00:02:47.840> we<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.769> bit<00:02:48.980> more<00:02:49.010> like

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
school we can do a little bit more like

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.470 
school we can do a little bit more like
20<00:02:49.940> years<00:02:50.090> 25<00:02:50.660> years<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.980> they<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.430> maybe<00:02:53.090> make

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
20 years 25 years so they can maybe make

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.750 
20 years 25 years so they can maybe make
it<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.930> little<00:02:54.109> bit<00:02:54.350> smaller<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:55.070> fit<00:02:55.100> into<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it a little bit smaller to fit into the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.660 
it a little bit smaller to fit into the
package<00:02:56.239> but<00:02:57.109> or<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.709> know<00:02:57.829> new<00:02:57.980> technology

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
package but or you know new technology

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.490 
package but or you know new technology
is<00:02:58.730> not<00:02:58.850> there<00:02:59.120> today<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.079> incorporate

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
is not there today they can incorporate

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.949 
is not there today they can incorporate
it<00:03:00.890> into<00:03:01.010> their<00:03:01.280> design<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:02.299> for<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.660> what<00:03:02.870> is

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
it into their design and for you what is

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.289 
it into their design and for you what is
the<00:03:02.989> 1930s<00:03:03.890> car<00:03:04.190> represent<00:03:04.730> why<00:03:04.850> is<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
the 1930s car represent why is it the

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.509 
the 1930s car represent why is it the
classic<00:03:05.959> era<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.739> cars<00:03:07.010> opposed<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> a

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
classic era of cars opposed to a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.330 
classic era of cars opposed to a
different<00:03:07.880> decade<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.450> think<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.709> elegance<00:03:10.160> of

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
different decade I think the elegance of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.840 
different decade I think the elegance of
line<00:03:10.640> there's<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.510> lot<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.870> straight-line

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
line there's a lot of straight-line

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.630 
line there's a lot of straight-line
streamlining<00:03:13.850> that's<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:14.810> stunning

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
streamlining that's just stunning

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.320 
streamlining that's just stunning
beautiful<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:17.319> detail<00:03:17.860> almost<00:03:18.460> like<00:03:18.910> cartier

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
beautiful in detail almost like cartier

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.600 
beautiful in detail almost like cartier
