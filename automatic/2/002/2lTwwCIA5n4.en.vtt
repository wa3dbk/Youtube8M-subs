to the remove Quantic level option but

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.110 
to the remove Quantic level option but
it<00:04:07.319> will<00:04:07.439> just<00:04:07.620> be<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:08.009> turn<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> blind<00:04:08.489> eye<00:04:08.879> for

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it will just be to turn a blind eye for

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.879 
it will just be to turn a blind eye for
some<00:04:09.299> reason<00:04:09.689> now<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.199> don't<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.560> what<00:04:10.739> this

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889
