00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660 

in<00:00:11.290> this<00:00:11.470> next<00:00:11.710> example<00:00:11.920> we're<00:00:12.520> actually

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
in this next example we're actually

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.090 
in this next example we're actually
trying<00:00:13.060> to<00:00:13.150> find<00:00:13.510> a<00:00:13.720> high<00:00:13.960> resistance<00:00:14.680> spot

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
trying to find a high resistance spot

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.790 
trying to find a high resistance spot
that<00:00:16.000> we<00:00:16.090> can<00:00:16.270> actually<00:00:16.420> see<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> little<00:00:17.710> bit

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
that we can actually see to a little bit

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.340 
that we can actually see to a little bit
to<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.010> right<00:00:18.040> of<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.779> ground<00:00:19.779> symbol<00:00:20.050> and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
to the right of the ground symbol and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.700 
to the right of the ground symbol and
first<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.310> actually<00:00:21.700> test<00:00:22.119> our<00:00:22.360> test<00:00:22.840> light<00:00:23.080> by

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
first we actually test our test light by

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.590 
first we actually test our test light by
actually<00:00:24.160> probing<00:00:24.550> between<00:00:24.939> our<00:00:25.150> voltage

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
actually probing between our voltage

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually probing between our voltage
sources<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.560> ground<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.700> this<00:00:27.880> it's<00:00:28.419> a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
sources and the ground and this it's a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.630 
sources and the ground and this it's a
good<00:00:28.750> indicator<00:00:29.169> that<00:00:29.470> we<00:00:29.619> actually<00:00:30.040> that<00:00:30.520> our

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
good indicator that we actually that our

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.800 
good indicator that we actually that our
test<00:00:30.910> light<00:00:31.090> is<00:00:31.329> working<00:00:31.619> properly<00:00:32.670> this

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
test light is working properly this

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.370 
test light is working properly this
actual<00:00:34.810> step<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.410> many<00:00:36.250> times<00:00:36.520> skipped<00:00:37.380> by

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
actual step is many times skipped by

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.470 
actual step is many times skipped by
many<00:00:38.620> technicians<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.489> test<00:00:39.970> lights<00:00:40.210> like

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
many technicians and test lights like

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.060 
many technicians and test lights like
any<00:00:40.630> other<00:00:40.780> piece<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:40.960> equipment<00:00:41.110> they<00:00:41.890> wear

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
any other piece of equipment they wear

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.990 
any other piece of equipment they wear
down<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.609> I<00:00:43.180> should<00:00:43.449> be<00:00:43.570> checked<00:00:44.350> before

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
down and I should be checked before

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.270 
down and I should be checked before
actually<00:00:46.000> doing<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.300> test<00:00:46.539> we<00:00:47.260> actually<00:00:47.739> also

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
actually doing the test we actually also

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.119 
actually doing the test we actually also
see<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:48.910> when<00:00:49.539> we<00:00:49.570> probe<00:00:50.019> at<00:00:50.769> pin

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
see here that when we probe at pin

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.009 
see here that when we probe at pin
number<00:00:51.430> 10<00:00:51.670> on<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> other<00:00:52.120> side<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.870> the

number 10 on the other side of the
ground<00:00:53.320> line<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.980> remember<00:00:54.760> we're<00:00:54.969> trying<00:00:55.210> to

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
ground line and remember we're trying to

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.790 
ground line and remember we're trying to
test<00:00:55.989> for<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.440> actual<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.579> high<00:00:58.210> resistant<00:00:58.929> spot

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
test for a actual a high resistant spot

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.579 
test for a actual a high resistant spot
on<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.070> circuit<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:01.210> test<00:01:01.480> light<00:01:01.690> will<00:01:02.019> also

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
on the circuit the test light will also

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.330 
on the circuit the test light will also
all<00:01:02.829> light<00:01:03.070> up<00:01:03.309> this<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.150> because<00:01:04.560> most<00:01:05.560> test

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
all light up this is because most test

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.490 
all light up this is because most test
lights<00:01:06.610> will<00:01:07.000> draw<00:01:07.270> between<00:01:07.510> two<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.470> three

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
lights will draw between two to three

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.590 
lights will draw between two to three
hundred<00:01:09.090> milliamps<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.550> actually<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
hundred milliamps and this is actually a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.340 
hundred milliamps and this is actually a
lot<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.140> sulfated<00:01:15.130> corroded<00:01:15.850> circuits<00:01:16.360> will

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
lot of sulfated corroded circuits will

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.730 
lot of sulfated corroded circuits will
actually<00:01:17.920> prevent<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:19.090> actual<00:01:19.450> circuit<00:01:19.960> from

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
actually prevent the actual circuit from

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.490 
actually prevent the actual circuit from
functioning<00:01:21.340> but<00:01:21.610> will<00:01:21.850> actually<00:01:22.500> have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
functioning but will actually have

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.359 
functioning but will actually have

and the best way to do it it's again

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.860 
and the best way to do it it's again
with<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> key<00:02:12.340> on<00:02:12.490> engine<00:02:12.640> cranking<00:02:12.870> to

stressed the system to its maximum or we

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.780 
stressed the system to its maximum or we

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
could do both an engine idling test and

next<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.350> actually<00:02:24.770> see<00:02:25.010> how<00:02:25.340> by<00:02:26.240> probing

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
next we actually see how by probing
