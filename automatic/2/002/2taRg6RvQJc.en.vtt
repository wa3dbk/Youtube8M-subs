that they haven't lost any of the
Headroom<00:01:59.320> it's<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.410> pretty<00:02:00.590> narrow<00:02:00.800> gap<00:02:02.320> the

boot<00:02:03.500> space<00:02:03.800> in<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.070> Skoda<00:02:04.310> looks<00:02:04.580> pretty

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
boot space in the Skoda looks pretty

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.390 
boot space in the Skoda looks pretty
good<00:02:05.480> it's<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.080> big<00:02:06.260> boot<00:02:06.530> if<00:02:06.920> anything<00:02:07.280> it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
good it's a big boot if anything it

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.240 
good it's a big boot if anything it
looks<00:02:07.430> as<00:02:07.880> though<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.660> kind<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:08.990> deep<00:02:09.250> but

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
looks as though it's kind of deep but

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.940 
looks as though it's kind of deep but
maybe<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.550> bit<00:02:10.700> narrow<00:02:11.110> there's<00:02:12.110> also<00:02:12.230> quite<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
maybe a bit narrow there's also quite a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.060 
maybe a bit narrow there's also quite a
big<00:02:13.160> lip<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.270> which<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:15.560> lift<00:02:15.740> heavy<00:02:15.980> stuff

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
big lip here which to lift heavy stuff

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.490 
big lip here which to lift heavy stuff
in<00:02:16.459> over<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.570> then<00:02:17.750> down<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.320> out

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
in over that and then down and then out

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.949 
in over that and then down and then out
again<00:02:18.790> maybe<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.120> bit<00:02:20.330> more<00:02:20.510> difficult

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
again maybe a little bit more difficult

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.410 
again maybe a little bit more difficult
than<00:02:21.020> I'd<00:02:21.230> like

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.260 

in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.990> Skoda<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.590> ride<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.040> fine<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
in the Skoda the ride is fine but it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.059 
in the Skoda the ride is fine but it
just<00:02:31.480> doesn't<00:02:31.960> feel<00:02:32.140> as<00:02:32.200> polished<00:02:32.770> as<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
just doesn't feel as polished as the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.920 
just doesn't feel as polished as the
other<00:02:33.190> two<00:02:33.459> there's<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.090> bit<00:02:34.270> more<00:02:34.420> bounce<00:02:34.630> when

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
other two there's a bit more bounce when

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.230 
other two there's a bit more bounce when
you<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.170> over<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.380> bump<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.459> visibility<00:02:37.120> in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
you go over a bump the visibility in

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.420 
you go over a bump the visibility in
here<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.450> great<00:02:37.750> lovely<00:02:38.380> big<00:02:38.530> windscreen<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
here is great lovely big windscreen and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.040 
here is great lovely big windscreen and
get<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.670> light<00:02:39.850> from<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> sunroof<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
get the light from the sunroof the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.690 
get the light from the sunroof the
trouble<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.680> responsiveness<00:02:42.400> of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
trouble is that the responsiveness of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.820 
trouble is that the responsiveness of
the<00:02:42.790> steering<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> pedals<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.319> not<00:02:44.590> quite

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the steering and the pedals is not quite

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.010 
the steering and the pedals is not quite
as<00:02:44.980> I'd<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:46.300> engine<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.630> great

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
as I'd like the engine is great

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.199 
as I'd like the engine is great
it's<00:02:47.230> punchy<00:02:47.860> enough<00:02:47.890> maybe<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.940> wouldn't

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
it's punchy enough maybe I wouldn't

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's punchy enough maybe I wouldn't
choose<00:02:49.480> an<00:02:49.600> automatic<00:02:50.140> gearbox<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.430> it's

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
choose an automatic gearbox but it's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.110 
choose an automatic gearbox but it's
really<00:02:51.910> smooth<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.450> quiet

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.180 

you
