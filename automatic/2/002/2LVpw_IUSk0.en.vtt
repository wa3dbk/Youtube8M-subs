00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
archers with piercing shots they dodged

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.860 
archers with piercing shots they dodged
some<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.850> armor<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.210> give<00:01:04.600> them<00:01:04.720> better

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
some of the armor and give them better

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.440 
some of the armor and give them better
attack<00:01:05.230> range<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.760> go<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.120> next<00:01:07.300> one

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
attack range if you go to the next one

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.030 
attack range if you go to the next one
they<00:01:07.870> get<00:01:07.990> even<00:01:08.170> higher<00:01:08.350> range<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.830> then<00:01:08.890> that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
they get even higher range and then that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.860 
they get even higher range and then that
makes<00:01:09.190> them<00:01:09.340> crit<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.880> that's<00:01:10.450> pretty<00:01:10.690> legit

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
makes them crit and that's pretty legit

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.380 
makes them crit and that's pretty legit
but<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.520> don't<00:01:12.520> know<00:01:12.580> we'll<00:01:12.820> see<00:01:12.850> how<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.180> mix

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
but I don't know we'll see how this mix

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.910 
but I don't know we'll see how this mix
goes<00:01:13.630> I'm<00:01:14.050> not<00:01:14.200> only<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.560> try<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.770> one

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920

like<00:04:20.639> after<00:04:21.000> beating<00:04:21.509> the<00:04:21.539> boss<00:04:21.840> level<00:04:22.139> with

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
like after beating the boss level with

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.469 
like after beating the boss level with
such<00:04:22.650> ease<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.400> almost<00:04:23.970> thought<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.360> was<00:04:24.449> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
such ease I almost thought that was the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.270 
such ease I almost thought that was the
end<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> game<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.650> not<00:04:30.860> wat<00:04:31.860> some

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
end of the game but it's not wat some

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.909 
end of the game but it's not wat some
get<00:04:32.940> some<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.780> case<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.199> can't<00:04:34.410> tell<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.590> did

get some in case you can't tell I did

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.629
