00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800
 We come to the topic of Peruvian kahon! 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 What was the key moment? 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 When you came here in the 80s, what happened? 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
 I was called by Luka de Tena 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 One of the Port de Tene families, since it's a great aristocratic family. 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.400
 And the Ambassador of Spain to Peru, 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 who gave me an honor. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.900
 ... and there was also Zabuk Granda at that party 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 A beautiful artist has excavated very beautiful compositions ... 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.980
 And when she started singing, a black, big man appeared: 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.820
 "It was Kaitro Soto." 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 A big guy and a very good and nice guy. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 And when I saw him with a kahon 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 I said this is our instrument! 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I clearly saw that when I saw him there. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 I say this because it is like a foot of a player: 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.900
 A deep ton of kahon that plays down 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 is actually like a sole player, 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.600
 and high sharp tones are the impact of shoes 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.120
 and besides, you can carry it with you anywhere! 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.580
 A Flamenco musician can not have drums home since they can not stand and his grandmother throws him out with drums on the street 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 It was perfect because it could be worn everywhere 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.440
 on weddings, at baptisms at every party 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.020
 You can wear it as you carry a guitar 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.660
 and I immediately asked Kaitra who makes this kahon? 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.520
 He said: I am making them, and I tell him to sell it to me! 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.220
 We agreed on the price for some time 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.584
 until he gave me 12000 peseta for me. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.320
 Did you give it to Ruben Dantas? 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.760
 Yes, I gave it to Rubem, I played it for a week and i 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.400
 After coming to Spain where we had one concert 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.120
 in one amusement park where there is a space for outdoor concerts. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.040
 It was not a month since there was one kahon in Spain in every flamenco house in Spain! 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.400
 That was incredible! 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.660
 And for this reason, this is what my percussionist Pira many times says: 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.580
 Pako thank you for bringing kahon because I and my brothers eat kahon! 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.260
 You put his wires in there, right? 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.240
 Yes, the kahon was very tight and tough 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.720
 and then the flamencoists removed the front panel 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.000
 and put screws on it, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 and so the front panel was slightly separated and gave a crisp sound, a flamenco sound with a flamenco guitar, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.720
 and in the end they also put the wires, they made a lot of variations! 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.440
 But it's still Peruvian kahon! 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 I know there are people in Peru who think 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.160
 that I had stolen their instrument in a way, 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.120
 Not! I always say wherever I go 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.880
 I found a kahon in Peru 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.320
 that he had given me Kaitro Soto, 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 and that's all thanks to Peru. I am very grateful! 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 And in flamenco it fits well, 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600
 and not just in flamenco in every genre like rock pop ...
