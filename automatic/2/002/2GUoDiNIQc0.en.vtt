00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.720
 youtube and I also wanted to tell you that 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.730
 it occurred to me to do this video because 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 I already noticed that many had commented 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.859
 and I also said good I'm already less than 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.810
 three thousand subscribers reach 40 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.599
 thousand subscribers and we'll get by 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.670
 end at 40 thousand I said then because not already 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.590
 is three years old and here the video says 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.260
 I'm going to reach 40 thousand 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.269
 subscribers so why not equal not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760
