00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
gotta I think its function f for to get

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
gotta I think its function f for to get
them<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.989> i'll<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.320> after<00:00:34.620> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
them back on but i'll do that after this
