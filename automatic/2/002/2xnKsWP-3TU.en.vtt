 with a video bottle as a 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:33.740
 bottle of wine and beer and so many 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:50.300
 changes in temperature with cold water and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.300
 also partly temperatures but 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 very 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 A) Yes 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.890
 it is a resistance of an electric 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.780
 alternate height and we are 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.690
 but many people 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:59.170
 we want that court where it goes 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.350
 to support the left resistance to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 right 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.850
 to this resistance 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.570
 because everything has a lot of final 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.140
 for example
