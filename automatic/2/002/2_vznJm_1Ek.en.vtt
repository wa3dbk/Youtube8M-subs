00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello very welcome to eye race 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 in another day and nothing a few 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 days we upload a video in the star mazda 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 in the circuit of the americas that good 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
 it was a pretty boring race where 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
 nothing happened at all 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 because I really do not street at 16 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.690
 laps that lasted and has been playing 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.670
 some more race and I think this video 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 it can be quite entertaining to see already 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.120
 has finally had my first fight of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.010
 truth with this car that really is 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.230
 very differently believe me the gt3 do not know 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.850
 can behave, much less equal to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.650
 when trying to overtake and good 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.690
 it really is something quite new to me 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 so I'm going to leave you as you are 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.079
 watching with two screens one of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.969
 repetition and another a board and step with 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
 my comments live while the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.350
 he played so nothing turn number 6 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 we are now going to see from the turn 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.769
 number 6 until round number 10 that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.969
 is what the duel lasts and well we are going to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.370
 see how it ends but I think it can be 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.379
 Quite funny, I'll leave you with my 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.379
 comments while running the race 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.740
 I lose a lot in the long curve of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.720
 right 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.750
 and that makes it impossible to get here 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.829
 stuck to try to pass it very 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.829
 I hope boxes do not miss 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.910
 is that here I am much faster in this 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910
 part 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.550
 but clear forward here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 as he saw braking a lot there braking a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.720
 miracle number middle number 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.420
 u and how close that near the side or long 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.890
 I skidded we have been about to 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.700
 finish the two out buff to point two 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.700
 failures at the same time 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.450
 and it saves us but just like now it's my 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.450
 opportunity 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.710
 no no 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.380
 because I can still try it to the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.810
 exit of curve 1 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.810
 I'm going to try to go outside now 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.060
 Wow 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.940
 jove 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.099
 dv 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.299
 that's what I wanted to do 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.910
 I wanted to do that but I did it 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.730
 mine what rage 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.730
 is that I have left the inside fit 10 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.640
 well at least the fight can be pretty 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 again again 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.610
 watch out 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.769
 is committing a lot of failures 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.769
 now 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.159
 dv 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.229
 I need to be and now 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.559
 cold 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.400
 audio tv man 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:36.779
 there it is I knew it I knew it that was the 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:39.059
 movement and I've said before 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:42.909
 try it the first time I knew that that 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:44.659
 it was the site fuck what good 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.219
 unfortunately we are already with 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.469
 Deferred comments as you will 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:51.050
 Of course the change in tone going 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:54.369
 to see how the man that I just 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.369
 overtaking comes out 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.590
 Exactly a shame and good really 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.420
 surely it was going to be pretty 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.160
 complicated for him to follow me because 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.540
 I was being quite faster from 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.370
 pretty much round number 5 but 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.560
 man I would have liked to be able to continue 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.910
 with the duel until the final part but 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.410
 I can not be in any case I think he has 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.490
 been pretty fun to watch and about 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.470
 everything I like to me the 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.210
 overtaking is that I did what I wanted 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.040
 do before you even try it not the 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.260
 issue of going outside because in that curve 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.120
 it can really go much faster 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.770
 if you have the outside line you make more 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.050
 meters but it is clear that it was quite 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.940
 beneficial and clear in the first 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.080
 attempts he did not leave me or he got 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.120
 outside and I did not really have 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.520
 escape had to go with a lot 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.680
 careful on the inside but at 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.020
 final I came out much better in the round 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.850
 number 9 and I could finally win him the 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.650
 outside and give him the last I wanted him 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.350
 have really turned around number 6 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.640
 little more on my part we will see with 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.640
 more videos see you later
