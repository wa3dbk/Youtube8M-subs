00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so your target area and when you're

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.250 
so your target area and when you're
making<00:00:14.490> any<00:00:14.730> kind<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.000> attack<00:00:15.330> you're<00:00:15.900> aiming

making any kind of attack you're aiming
for<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.070> prime<00:00:17.789> area<00:00:17.820> every<00:00:18.690> once<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
for this prime area every once in a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.269 
for this prime area every once in a
while<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.470> different<00:00:19.740> sorts<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.010> flicks

while and some different sorts of flicks

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
while and some different sorts of flicks
or<00:00:20.520> flushes<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.060> might<00:00:21.210> hit<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
or flushes you might hit the back of a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.620 
or flushes you might hit the back of a
fencer<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.189> most<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> time<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.510> what

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
fencer but most of the time this is what

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
fencer but most of the time this is what
you're<00:00:24.750> aiming<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.430> we

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you're aiming for so this is how we

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.400 
you're aiming for so this is how we
divide<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> target<00:00:27.240> area<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.539> foil<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.260> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
divide the target area in foil it's as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
divide the target area in foil it's as
if<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.369> cross<00:00:29.640> right<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.090> across<00:00:30.660> my

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
if there is a cross right here across my

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
if there is a cross right here across my
middle<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.399> use<00:00:32.850> numbers<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
middle and then we use numbers to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
middle and then we use numbers to
describe<00:00:33.690> each<00:00:34.020> part<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> cross<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.489> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
describe each part of that cross so this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.290 
describe each part of that cross so this
quadrant<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> six<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:39.120> one

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
quadrant is for this one is six this one

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
quadrant is for this one is six this one
is<00:00:39.420> seven<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.890> eight<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is seven and this one is eight and the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
is seven and this one is eight and the
numbers<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> same<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:42.960> opponent<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
numbers are the same and my opponent so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.420 
numbers are the same and my opponent so
that<00:00:45.020> every<00:00:46.020> time<00:00:46.230> someone<00:00:46.770> makes<00:00:47.010> an<00:00:47.160> attack

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that every time someone makes an attack

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.299 
that every time someone makes an attack
you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.120> divide<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:49.200> least<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> idea<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you can divide at least the idea of the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
you can divide at least the idea of the
quadrant<00:00:50.760> into<00:00:51.239> these<00:00:51.390> four<00:00:51.899> sections<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
quadrant into these four sections and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
quadrant into these four sections and
the<00:00:52.949> ones<00:00:53.129> you'll<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.399> using<00:00:53.579> most<00:00:54.030> frequently

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the ones you'll be using most frequently

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.540 
the ones you'll be using most frequently
especially<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> begin<00:00:55.350> fencing<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.070> up

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
especially as you begin fencing are up

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
especially as you begin fencing are up
here<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.059> your<00:00:57.360> four<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.230> six<00:00:58.500> another

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
here are your four and your six another

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
here are your four and your six another
important<00:00:59.850> concept<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> understand<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
important concept to understand is the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
important concept to understand is the
concept<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.710> point<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.340> line<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
concept of point in line if I have a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
concept of point in line if I have a
point<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.140> line<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.650> foil<00:01:04.920> fencing<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.489> means

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
point in line in foil fencing it means

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.030 
point in line in foil fencing it means
that<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.420> foil<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.960> actually<00:01:07.409> aiming<00:01:07.680> at

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that my foil is actually aiming at

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.450 
that my foil is actually aiming at
target<00:01:09.030> area<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.630> opponent<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.100> tip<00:01:11.310> of

accompanying parries for for each but
those<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.350> your<00:02:39.440> four<00:02:39.590> basic<00:02:39.740> moves<00:02:40.160> and

again<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.660> beginning<00:02:42.050> you'll<00:02:42.680> find<00:02:42.950> that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
again in the beginning you'll find that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.120 
again in the beginning you'll find that
you<00:02:43.310> use<00:02:43.490> four<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.390> six<00:02:44.710> much<00:02:45.710> more<00:02:45.950> often

you use four and six much more often
than<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.700> other<00:02:46.820> two
