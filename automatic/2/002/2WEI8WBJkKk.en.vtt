00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
through space so in order to do that we

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
through space so in order to do that we
measured<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> location<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> Andromeda

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.120 
galaxies actually collide with each
other<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.690> Stars<00:02:50.720> basically<00:02:51.110> pass<00:02:51.590> right

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
other the Stars basically pass right

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.280 
other the Stars basically pass right
between<00:02:52.310> each<00:02:52.700> other<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.630> chance<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.080> two

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
between each other and the chance of two

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.140 
between each other and the chance of two
stars<00:02:54.590> directly<00:02:54.890> hitting<00:02:55.340> each<00:02:55.730> other<00:02:55.940> is

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
stars directly hitting each other is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.930 
stars directly hitting each other is
really<00:02:56.180> really<00:02:56.840> small<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.700> likelihood

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
really really small so the likelihood

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.880 
really really small so the likelihood
that<00:02:59.269> our<00:02:59.510> solar<00:02:59.750> system<00:02:59.840> will<00:03:00.230> be<00:03:00.620> directly

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
that our solar system will be directly

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.150 
that our solar system will be directly
impacted<00:03:01.700> by<00:03:02.150> an<00:03:02.780> other<00:03:02.959> star<00:03:03.350> for<00:03:03.680> example<00:03:03.709> in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
impacted by an other star for example in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.860 
impacted by an other star for example in
Andromeda<00:03:04.280> as<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:04.910> collide<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> is

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
Andromeda as we collide with it is

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.620 
Andromeda as we collide with it is
really<00:03:06.230> really<00:03:06.530> small<00:03:06.920> well<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.060> life<00:03:08.420> is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
really really small well if life is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.300 
really really small well if life is
still<00:03:08.780> present<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.290> earth<00:03:09.350> when<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.890> happens

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
still present on earth when this happens

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.190 
still present on earth when this happens
the<00:03:10.610> changes<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.390> sky<00:03:11.510> will<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:12.019> quite

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
the changes in the sky will be quite

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.910 
the changes in the sky will be quite
spectacular

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
spectacular

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.310 
spectacular
now<00:03:13.040> they<00:03:13.280> will<00:03:13.459> be<00:03:13.489> very<00:03:13.850> very<00:03:14.060> slow<00:03:14.690> because

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
now they will be very very slow because

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.949 
now they will be very very slow because

the timescales on the scales of galaxies

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.259 
the timescales on the scales of galaxies
in<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> universe<00:03:18.290> are<00:03:18.860> very<00:03:18.890> very<00:03:19.400> long<00:03:19.670> so

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
in the universe are very very long so

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.660 
in the universe are very very long so
you<00:03:20.329> have<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.660> think<00:03:20.900> millions<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.769> years<00:03:22.100> but

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
you have to think millions of years but

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.430 
you have to think millions of years but
even<00:03:22.700> then<00:03:23.150> over<00:03:23.690> these<00:03:23.840> timescales<00:03:24.200> of

even then over these timescales of
millions<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:24.920> years<00:03:25.250> we<00:03:25.850> will<00:03:25.970> see<00:03:26.030> big

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
millions of years we will see big

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150

Andromeda<00:03:29.690> will<00:03:30.230> be<00:03:30.260> huge<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> sky<00:03:31.040> it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
Andromeda will be huge on the sky it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.340 
Andromeda will be huge on the sky it
will<00:03:31.549> be<00:03:31.700> as<00:03:31.850> big<00:03:32.120> as<00:03:32.299> our<00:03:32.420> Milky<00:03:32.630> Way<00:03:32.810> because

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
will be as big as our Milky Way because

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.250 
will be as big as our Milky Way because
we'll<00:03:33.650> be<00:03:33.769> very<00:03:33.890> close<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.730> then<00:03:35.600> later

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
we'll be very close to it and then later

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.150 
we'll be very close to it and then later
when<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> galaxies<00:03:37.519> merge<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.840> merged

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
when the galaxies merge the merged

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.830 
when the galaxies merge the merged
remnant<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.880> Milky<00:03:41.209> Way<00:03:41.239> galaxy<00:03:41.329> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
remnant of the Milky Way galaxy and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.810 
remnant of the Milky Way galaxy and
Andromeda<00:03:42.160> will<00:03:43.160> look<00:03:43.310> more<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:43.519> an

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
Andromeda will look more like an

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.090 
Andromeda will look more like an
elliptical<00:03:43.880> galaxy<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.900> we<00:03:44.930> will<00:03:45.709> be<00:03:45.829> sitting

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
elliptical galaxy and we will be sitting

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.880 
elliptical galaxy and we will be sitting
right<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.390> view<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.410> Milky<00:03:48.860> Way

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
right in it so the view of the Milky Way

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.860 
right in it so the view of the Milky Way
on<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.400> night<00:03:49.579> sky<00:03:49.820> will<00:03:50.060> be<00:03:50.180> completely<00:03:50.540> gone

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
on the night sky will be completely gone

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.770 
on the night sky will be completely gone
and<00:03:51.200> this<00:03:52.160> band<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.790> light<00:03:53.000> will<00:03:53.239> be<00:03:53.269> replaced

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
and this band of light will be replaced

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.530 
and this band of light will be replaced
by<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.109> more<00:03:54.500> spheroidal<00:03:54.850> distribution<00:03:55.850> of

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
by a more spheroidal distribution of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.199 
by a more spheroidal distribution of
life

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
life

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.670 
life
and<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.060> Sun<00:04:01.329> born<00:04:01.569> in<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.290> Milky<00:04:02.379> Way

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
and so the Sun born in the Milky Way

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.520 
and so the Sun born in the Milky Way
almost<00:04:03.099> 5<00:04:03.340> billion<00:04:03.879> years<00:04:04.239> ago<00:04:04.359> will<00:04:05.200> end<00:04:05.379> its

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
almost 5 billion years ago will end its

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.550 
almost 5 billion years ago will end its
life<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.129> new<00:04:06.159> orbit<00:04:06.609> as<00:04:06.969> part<00:04:07.689> of<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.349> new
