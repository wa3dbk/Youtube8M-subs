00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
a good sign for increased activity so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.330 
a good sign for increased activity so
let's<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> various<00:00:56.010> active

let's take a look at the various active

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
let's take a look at the various active
regions<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.890> at<00:00:58.890> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
regions on the disk actually according

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
regions on the disk actually according
to<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.420> eight<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:04.409> claim<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to know we have eight they claim that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.070 
to know we have eight they claim that
region<00:01:04.949> 1307<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.670> returned<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:07.020> a

region 1307 has returned now there was a

small poor there earlier today what I

small poor there earlier today what I
just<00:01:09.750> looked<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.260> gone<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
just looked it has gone so I'm not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
just looked it has gone so I'm not
counting<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.760> region<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
counting that region as I say we have a

counting that region as I say we have a
new<00:01:13.740> region<00:01:13.950> numbered<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> region<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> came

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
new region numbered the region that came

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
new region numbered the region that came
over<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> southeast<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.680> day

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
over the southeast in the other day

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.910 
over the southeast in the other day
that's<00:01:17.580> region<00:01:17.939> 13<00:01:18.330> 13

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
that's region 13 13

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.149 
that's region 13 13
let's<00:01:19.759> start<00:01:20.000> with<00:01:20.150> region<00:01:20.479> 13<00:01:20.930> 05<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
let's start with region 13 05 in the

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.649 
let's start with region 13 05 in the
northwest<00:01:23.710> region<00:01:24.710> 13<00:01:25.040> 05<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:26.299> getting<00:01:26.630> very

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
northwest region 13 05 is getting very

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.719 
northwest region 13 05 is getting very
close<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.259> west<00:01:27.560> slim<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.549> very

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
close to the west slim and so is very

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.920 
close to the west slim and so is very
difficult<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.090> tell<00:01:29.210> what's<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.450> on<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:29.869> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
difficult to tell what's going on but it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.969 
difficult to tell what's going on but it
doesn't<00:01:30.140> look<00:01:30.200> as<00:01:30.290> though<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.560> changed<00:01:30.860> very

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
doesn't look as though it's changed very

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.820 
doesn't look as though it's changed very
much<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.460> me<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.930> meantime<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.530> region

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
much to me in the meantime the region

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.520 
much to me in the meantime the region
trailing<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.340> region<00:01:34.640> 13<00:01:34.970> 06<00:01:35.420> seems<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.440> have

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
trailing it region 13 06 seems to have

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.310 
trailing it region 13 06 seems to have
decayed<00:01:36.860> yet<00:01:37.130> further<00:01:37.479> from<00:01:38.479> two<00:01:38.720> small<00:01:38.990> spots

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
decayed yet further from two small spots

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.889 
decayed yet further from two small spots
to<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.680> small<00:01:39.979> spot<00:01:40.479> next<00:01:41.479> we'll<00:01:41.570> move<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.869> to

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
to one small spot next we'll move on to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.660 
to one small spot next we'll move on to
Regions<00:01:42.380> 1309<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.729> 13<00:01:44.030> 12<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.689> Northeast

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
Regions 1309 and 13 12 in the Northeast

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.760 
Regions 1309 and 13 12 in the Northeast
region<00:01:46.670> 13<00:01:46.970> 09<00:01:47.320> doesn't<00:01:48.320> seem<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.619> have

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
region 13 09 doesn't seem to have

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.219 
region 13 09 doesn't seem to have
changed<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:49.520> great<00:01:49.549> deal<00:01:49.759> has<00:01:50.509> been<00:01:50.570> some<00:01:50.929> decay

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
changed a great deal has been some decay

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.990 
changed a great deal has been some decay
in<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.530> trailer<00:01:52.069> part<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.520> region<00:01:52.819> but

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
in the trailer part of the region but

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.309 
in the trailer part of the region but
some<00:01:53.179> development<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.750> leader<00:01:53.929> part<00:01:54.229> of

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
some development in the leader part of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.830 
some development in the leader part of
the<00:01:54.440> region<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:54.800> that's<00:01:54.950> probably<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.369> push

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the region so that's probably a push

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840 
the region so that's probably a push
region<00:01:56.840> 13<00:01:57.140> 12<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.679> larger<00:01:58.130> single<00:01:58.490> spot

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
region 13 12 is the larger single spot

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.210 
region 13 12 is the larger single spot
near<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.299> limb<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.720> hasn't<00:02:00.649> changed<00:02:00.920> at<00:02:01.039> all

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
near the limb and hasn't changed at all

as<00:02:01.399> far<00:02:01.460> as<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:01.850> can<00:02:01.909> see<00:02:02.229> next<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.319> should<00:02:03.380> turn

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
as far as I can see next we should turn

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.370 
as far as I can see next we should turn
to<00:02:03.740> region<00:02:04.130> 13<00:02:04.490> 10<00:02:04.789> in<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> southwest<00:02:05.509> this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
to region 13 10 in the southwest this

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.660 
to region 13 10 in the southwest this
region<00:02:06.649> seem<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.860> hate<00:02:07.039> quite<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> bit<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
region seem to hate quite a bit in the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.180 
region seem to hate quite a bit in the
last<00:02:07.700> 24<00:02:08.209> hours<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:09.679> seems<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.100> lost

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
last 24 hours this seems to have lost

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
last 24 hours this seems to have lost
most<00:02:10.459> of<00:02:10.580> his<00:02:10.670> trailer<00:02:10.940> spots<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.780> leader

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
most of his trailer spots and the leader

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.590 
most of his trailer spots and the leader
spot<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.319> weakened<00:02:12.680> considerably<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:14.510> is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
spot is weakened considerably there is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.059 
spot is weakened considerably there is
an<00:02:14.690> unnumbered<00:02:14.959> region<00:02:15.380> emerging<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:15.980> to

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
an unnumbered region emerging just to

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.039 
an unnumbered region emerging just to
the<00:02:16.190> east<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.580> north<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.120> region<00:02:17.360> but

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
the east and north of this region but

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.539 
the east and north of this region but
it's<00:02:18.200> very<00:02:18.350> weak<00:02:18.620> at<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.830> moment<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.370> don't

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
it's very weak at the moment and I don't

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.880 
it's very weak at the moment and I don't
think<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:19.819> going<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.060> amount<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.330> much<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
think it's going to amount to much the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.220 
think it's going to amount to much the
interesting<00:02:22.220> thing<00:02:22.280> about<00:02:22.430> region<00:02:22.940> 13<00:02:23.269> 11<00:02:23.540> is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
interesting thing about region 13 11 is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.069 
interesting thing about region 13 11 is
that<00:02:24.380> what<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> low<00:02:24.799> latitude<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.519> formed

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
that what a low latitude it is formed

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.390 
that what a low latitude it is formed
much<00:02:27.079> lower<00:02:27.290> than<00:02:27.410> any<00:02:27.739> of<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.890> other<00:02:28.010> regions

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
much lower than any of the other regions

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.539 
much lower than any of the other regions
in<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.850> south<00:02:29.560> however<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.890> also<00:02:31.250> seems<00:02:31.459> to

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
in the south however it to also seems to

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.180 
in the south however it to also seems to
be<00:02:31.609> decaying<00:02:31.940> slowed<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.560> new<00:02:33.709> region<00:02:34.040> region

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
be decaying slowed the new region region

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.380 
be decaying slowed the new region region

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
structure it seems to be comprised of

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.690

two large spots one leader one trailer
this<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.329> smaller<00:02:44.630> satellite<00:02:45.049> spots<00:02:45.320> in

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
this is smaller satellite spots in

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.310 
this is smaller satellite spots in
between<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:47.420> ahead<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> its<00:02:48.079> West

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
between just ahead of it to its West

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.949 
between just ahead of it to its West
there<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> small<00:02:49.519> region<00:02:49.760> emerging<00:02:50.390> again

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
there is a small region emerging again

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.680 
there is a small region emerging again
on<00:02:51.109> numbered<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.880> let's<00:02:53.120> take<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.269> look<00:02:53.329> at<00:02:53.570> the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
on numbered now let's take a look at the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.270 
on numbered now let's take a look at the
continuous<00:02:54.260> development<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.769> these<00:02:54.859> regions

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
continuous development of these regions

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.789 
continuous development of these regions
using<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.820> HMI<00:02:56.209> data<00:02:56.510> first<00:02:57.500> we'll<00:02:57.620> take<00:02:57.739> a

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
using the HMI data first we'll take a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.650 
using the HMI data first we'll take a
look<00:02:57.920> at<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.190> sunspot<00:02:58.670> movie<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.570> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
look at the sunspot movie and in the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.330 
look at the sunspot movie and in the
magnetic<00:03:00.109> movie<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.560> again<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.160> think

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
magnetic movie and again I think

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.920 
magnetic movie and again I think
concentrating<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.180> Saudis<00:03:02.540> limb<00:03:02.780> is

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
concentrating on the Saudis limb is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.360 
concentrating on the Saudis limb is
probably<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> most<00:03:03.470> productive<00:03:03.769> approach

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
probably the most productive approach

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610 
probably the most productive approach
note<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.239> we<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.390> six<00:03:06.780> magnetic<00:03:07.230> regions

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
note that we have six magnetic regions

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.330 
note that we have six magnetic regions
merging<00:03:08.129> in<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> southeast<00:03:08.849> area

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.800 

I<00:03:14.019> understand<00:03:15.019> from<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.290> sdo<00:03:15.620> team<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
I understand from the sdo team that the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.600 
I understand from the sdo team that the
helium<00:03:17.810> 2<00:03:17.959> 304<00:03:18.590> channel<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> AIA

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
helium 2 304 channel in the AIA

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.699 
helium 2 304 channel in the AIA
instruments<00:03:20.239> been<00:03:20.360> having<00:03:20.629> some<00:03:20.780> problems<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
instruments been having some problems so

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.110 
instruments been having some problems so
they're<00:03:21.860> baking<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.280> telescope<00:03:22.700> out<00:03:22.910> at<00:03:23.030> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
they're baking the telescope out at the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.309 
they're baking the telescope out at the
moment<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.569> that's<00:03:23.750> why<00:03:23.870> there's<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.110> positive

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
moment so that's why there's a positive

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.440 
moment so that's why there's a positive
data<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.730> meantime<00:03:25.879> let's<00:03:26.150> take<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.300> look

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
both south and east of the earth so it

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.190

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860

planets and it's even more so when you

planets and it's even more so when you
