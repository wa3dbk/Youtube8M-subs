instructions and how to do the repair so
here<00:00:28.450> we<00:00:28.510> go<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:30.010> located<00:00:30.520> where<00:00:30.670> the

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
here we go with located where the

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.799 
here we go with located where the
problem<00:00:31.119> is<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.890> we'll<00:00:33.010> pull<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.309> out<00:00:33.809> like

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
problem is so we'll pull it out like

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.840 
problem is so we'll pull it out like
that<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.949> then<00:00:36.010> we<00:00:36.280> know<00:00:36.400> where<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.670> hole<00:00:36.820> is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
that and then we know where the hole is

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.250 
that and then we know where the hole is
so<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.780> next<00:00:37.930> step<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.620> lubricate<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:39.160> Pro

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so the next step is to lubricate the Pro

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.570 
so the next step is to lubricate the Pro
ok<00:00:41.260> we've<00:00:41.710> pulled<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.980> nail<00:00:42.129> out<00:00:42.309> we've<00:00:42.430> know

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
ok we've pulled the nail out we've know

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.009 
ok we've pulled the nail out we've know
where<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.790> hole<00:00:42.940> is<00:00:43.120> so<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.390> next<00:00:43.570> step<00:00:43.720> is<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
where the hole is so the next step is to

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.229 
where the hole is so the next step is to
clean<00:00:44.260> up<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.530> hole<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.129> type<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.760> lube<00:00:45.940> and

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
clean up the hole so type of lube and

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.689 
clean up the hole so type of lube and
your<00:00:46.420> probe<00:00:46.629> tool<00:00:46.900> just<00:00:47.830> coat<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.220> tip<00:00:48.400> of<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
your probe tool just coat the tip of the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.350 
your probe tool just coat the tip of the
the<00:00:48.940> probe<00:00:49.180> with<00:00:49.360> some<00:00:49.510> Lube<00:00:50.970> and<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.150> drive

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
the probe with some Lube and you drive

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.270 
the probe with some Lube and you drive
that<00:00:52.629> through<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.050> tire<00:00:53.260> all<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.830> way<00:00:53.949> it<00:00:54.129> has

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
that through the tire all the way it has

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.439 
that through the tire all the way it has
to<00:00:54.430> go<00:00:54.550> through<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.879> steel<00:00:55.120> belt<00:00:55.360> and

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
to go through the steel belt and

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.789 
to go through the steel belt and
everything<00:00:55.510> right<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.350> inside<00:00:56.470> of<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
everything right to the inside of the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.700 
everything right to the inside of the
tire<00:00:58.290> that's<00:00:59.290> how<00:00:59.470> it<00:01:00.159> should<00:01:00.220> look<00:01:00.549> like<00:01:00.610> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
tire that's how it should look like that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.619 
tire that's how it should look like that
ok<00:01:02.710> once<00:01:02.979> you've<00:01:03.159> you've<00:01:04.150> driven<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.449> reamer

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
ok once you've you've driven the reamer

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.840 
ok once you've you've driven the reamer
through<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:04.989> hole<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.290> cleaned<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.850> pull

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
through the hole and cleaned it up pull

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.180 
through the hole and cleaned it up pull
the<00:01:06.880> reamer<00:01:07.120> out<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.440> next<00:01:08.680> step<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
the reamer out and the next step is to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.270 
the reamer out and the next step is to
use<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.670> insertion<00:01:10.270> tool<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.950> get<00:01:12.070> one<00:01:12.190> of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
use the insertion tool so you get one of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880 
use the insertion tool so you get one of
the<00:01:12.369> self<00:01:12.610> vulcanizing<00:01:13.119> plugs<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.799> you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
the self vulcanizing plugs and you

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.960 
the self vulcanizing plugs and you
thread<00:01:15.130> it<00:01:15.250> through<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.580> eye<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.940> needle

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
thread it through the eye of the needle

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.120 
thread it through the eye of the needle
they're<00:01:16.360> nice<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:17.290> even<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:17.800> half<00:01:17.950> way

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
they're nice and even so it's half way

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.690 
they're nice and even so it's half way
along<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.810> drive<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.380> through<00:01:20.890> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
along and then you drive it through the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.660 
along and then you drive it through the
hole<00:01:25.110> ok<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.440> it's<00:01:26.650> quite<00:01:26.830> hard<00:01:27.130> takes<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.520> bit

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
hole ok so it's quite hard takes a bit

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.240 
hole ok so it's quite hard takes a bit
of<00:01:27.760> strength<00:01:28.000> but<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.210> push<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.250> going

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
of strength but you push it in so going

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.740 
of strength but you push it in so going
oh<00:01:30.460> here<00:01:31.330> we<00:01:31.390> go

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
oh here we go

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.170 
oh here we go
and<00:01:31.900> then<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.140> next<00:01:32.290> step<00:01:32.890> using<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:33.970> round

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
and then the next step using this round

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.760 
and then the next step using this round
bracket<00:01:34.540> hold<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:34.900> down<00:01:35.110> against<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.530> tyre

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
bracket hold that down against the tyre

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.820 
bracket hold that down against the tyre
while<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.250> pull<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> tool<00:01:36.760> out<00:01:40.620> now<00:01:41.620> that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
while you pull the tool out now that

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.430 
while you pull the tool out now that
should<00:01:42.010> have<00:01:42.100> plugged<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.400> hole

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.670 

okay<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:51.830> your<00:01:52.820> insert<00:01:53.150> tool<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:54.260> obviously

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
okay so your insert tool is obviously

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.110 
okay so your insert tool is obviously
the<00:01:54.860> plugs<00:01:55.100> come<00:01:55.370> out<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.820> plug<00:01:56.000> is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
the plugs come out and the plug is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.510 
the plugs come out and the plug is
actually<00:01:56.450> left<00:01:56.600> in<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.900> hole<00:01:57.080> right<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:57.620> so

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
actually left in the hole right there so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.310 
actually left in the hole right there so
that's<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.790> temporary<00:01:59.060> fix<00:01:59.480> mind<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.990> this

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
that's a temporary fix mind you this

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.600 
that's a temporary fix mind you this
isn't<00:02:00.590> permanent

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
isn't permanent

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.640 
isn't permanent
if<00:02:01.940> you're<00:02:02.120> at<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.390> trouble<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.350> use<00:02:03.530> it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
if you're at in trouble you can use it

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.930 
if you're at in trouble you can use it
to<00:02:03.770> plug<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.070> but<00:02:04.190> make<00:02:04.310> sure<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.580> get<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
to plug it but make sure you get to the
