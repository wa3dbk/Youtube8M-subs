Microsoft's Windows 8 slate the original

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.629 
Microsoft's Windows 8 slate the original
version<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.009> our<00:00:14.130> favorite<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
version was one of our favorite of the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.630 
version was one of our favorite of the
first<00:00:14.940> gen<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.960> windows<00:00:16.470> 8<00:00:16.619> slates<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
first gen of windows 8 slates because it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
first gen of windows 8 slates because it
had<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> full<00:00:18.420> core<00:00:18.720> i5<00:00:19.080> processor<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.890> a

had a full core i5 processor and a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.460 
had a full core i5 processor and a
really<00:00:20.220> clever<00:00:20.550> keyboard<00:00:21.390> cover<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.050> keep<00:00:22.260> all

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
really clever keyboard cover we keep all

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
really clever keyboard cover we keep all
that<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> new<00:00:23.130> version<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.640> fact<00:00:23.880> it's

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that with this new version in fact it's

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
that with this new version in fact it's
pretty<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> same<00:00:24.720> size<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.320> same

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pretty much the same size the same

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.500 
pretty much the same size the same
weight<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.730> biggest<00:00:27.000> difference<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
weight the biggest difference to the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
weight the biggest difference to the
body<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.199> kick<00:00:28.410> stand<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> back

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
body is the kick stand in the back

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
body is the kick stand in the back
course<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> pull<00:00:29.670> out<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> kickstand<00:00:30.390> now

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
course you pull out the kickstand now

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
course you pull out the kickstand now
like<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> surface<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> has<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> second

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like the surface to it has a second

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
like the surface to it has a second
angle<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.680> that's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
angle so you can go like this that's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
angle so you can go like this that's
especially<00:00:35.250> important<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:35.910> you're<00:00:36.270> trying<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
especially important if you're trying to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.970 
especially important if you're trying to
use<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.079> lap<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.680> sitting<00:00:37.920> up

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
use it on your lap or you're sitting up

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
use it on your lap or you're sitting up
a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.370> higher<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.879> course<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.510> go

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
a little bit higher of course you can go

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.200 
a little bit higher of course you can go
back<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> original<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
back to the original like this

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
back to the original like this
internally<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.239> biggest<00:00:42.600> change<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.110> these

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
internally the biggest change is these

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110 
internally the biggest change is these
guys<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.950> moved<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.399> Intel's<00:00:44.879> latest

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
guys have moved to Intel's latest

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
guys have moved to Intel's latest
generation<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.050> processes<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.800> call<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
generation of processes we call that the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
generation of processes we call that the
fourth-generation<00:00:47.879> core<00:00:48.210> i<00:00:48.539> series<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fourth-generation core i series you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
fourth-generation core i series you
might<00:00:49.770> also<00:00:50.039> hear<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.670> refer<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.210> Haswell

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
might also hear that refer to as Haswell

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
might also hear that refer to as Haswell
and<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> gives<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> modest

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and what that gives you is it's a modest

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.490 
and what that gives you is it's a modest
performance<00:00:54.360> improvement<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> most

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
performance improvement but the most

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
performance improvement but the most
important<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> battery<00:00:56.760> life

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
important thing is the battery life

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.010 
important thing is the battery life
boost<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.360> should<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.840> better

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
boost you should get a lot better

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.770 
boost you should get a lot better
battery<00:00:58.469> life<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> new<00:00:59.309> chips<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
battery life with the new chips and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.760 
battery life with the new chips and
microsoft<00:01:00.780> says<00:01:00.989> they've<00:01:01.140> done<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.739> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
microsoft says they've done a lot of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
microsoft says they've done a lot of
tweaking<00:01:02.070> inside<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> give<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> additional

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
tweaking inside to give you additional

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.420 
tweaking inside to give you additional
battery<00:01:03.719> life<00:01:03.870> gains<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> top<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
battery life gains on top of that so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
battery life gains on top of that so
that<00:01:05.460> plus<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> Haswell<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.630> hopefully

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that plus the Haswell will hopefully

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
that plus the Haswell will hopefully
give<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> an<00:01:07.409> all-day<00:01:07.979> tablet<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
give you an all-day tablet that you can

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.420 
give you an all-day tablet that you can
