00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.609
 but without victory and last four years say EUR 4 - that's how it is now 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.879
 human head through 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.170
 I'm myself Mans since the moon has actually been around 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.109
 theme 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.119
 in the plus fell the 3 to this game 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 it drives me crazy 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210
 It's like that now 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.599
 that when I start the game I can look which missions to play 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.239
 want 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.310
 he also lives diligently 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.579
 around 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.859
 but either thrown in a pitch 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.770
 impose themselves in the transition from a video to the game 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.770
 The game gives Max power when I come to the Rhine 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.350
 i am powerful can not absorb i will try there somehow percent 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.160
 to eliminate this problem but for the time being is first percent 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060
 Help for the parents 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.290
 yes in traffic lights manpower worries 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 "I beat 'such Werner Selle shown as in the penultimate session 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.460

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.170
 the word for Sunday 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 subscribers 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.390
 I wanted to do a lot of talking but then decided against it 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.450
 because 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.260
 I would not have been worth it again immediately two days later 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 Proverbs have to make for the 500 as well as she is currently running 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030
 that's why at 500 the best I have already got a two three four five 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.900
 ideas 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 I hope that I also have some one 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.770
 kicking in ass that can actually take something special with me 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240
 percent 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.079

 Company loses the test of whether it works 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.580
 if it does not work which direction you can give h 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.610
