00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.510 
about an hour after training doesn't
matter<00:01:14.060> i<00:01:14.330> think<00:01:14.840> if<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.080> waited<00:01:15.290> an<00:01:15.500> hour<00:01:15.710> vs.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
matter i think if you waited an hour vs.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.580 
matter i think if you waited an hour vs.
waiting<00:01:16.850> 15<00:01:17.270> minutes<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.930> difference<00:01:18.380> will

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
waiting 15 minutes the difference will

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.310 
waiting 15 minutes the difference will
be<00:01:18.620> at<00:01:18.890> all<00:01:19.280> at<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.210> end<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.540> day<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.140> my

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
be at all at the end of the day so my

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.410 
be at all at the end of the day so my
opinion<00:01:21.620> is<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.190> are<00:01:22.220> cutting<00:01:22.700> or<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.300> are

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
opinion is if you are cutting or you are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.390 
opinion is if you are cutting or you are
