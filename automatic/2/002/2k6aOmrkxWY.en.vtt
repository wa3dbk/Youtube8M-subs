00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
going to have this definition I think

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.750 
going to have this definition I think
it's<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.080> going<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.410> get<00:04:50.560> fuller<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.340> bigger

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
it's just going to get fuller and bigger

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.060 
it's just going to get fuller and bigger
and<00:04:52.590> i<00:04:54.300> gotta<00:04:55.300> say<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.720> i<00:04:56.260> love<00:04:56.410> these

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070
