 I know how long it will take to upload the video and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.869
 good is a montage of battlefield 3 is 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.619
 a montage that good led me to do 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 two weeks since I my knowledge 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 about edit 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.360
 I was going to say null but that's going to be 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.800
 boast of knowledge so good 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.550
 I am quite happy with the result 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.640
 and the pineapple and well who has seen it 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.350
 since there have been two people who 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.910
 they have seen then they have told me that they are 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
 pretty good so it cheers me up a lot 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.090
 because I thought that there was no 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.030
 as well as I would like so 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.520
 this afternoon or good if this afternoon Tuesday 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.800
 then you can see the assembly of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 battlefield 3 act ask me battlefield 3 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.450
 Well, here comes battlefield 3 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 if you have not uploaded battlefield 3 with more 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.240
 regularity good regularity 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.210
 directly has been the regularity has 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.680
 been zero lately has been for a 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.210
 simple reason and is that I have not had 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.160
 all the time that I would like to dedicate to 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.600
 the console so since I did not have much 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.970
 weather 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.860
 I did not feel like entering the battlefield either 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.050
 because the games to battlefield you'll know 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.080
 what to play battlefield requires 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.390
 enter battlefield and dedicate yourself to bat 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.500
 the film or a long enough time is not 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 like call of duty, not that you get in and in 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.200
 a little while you have two or three games 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.110
 and you know everything and well a little 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.670
 more for here in run of lujÃ¡n play as 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.200
 they say of the hard disks to put and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.760
 to play 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.690
 let's see magic johnson 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 there you have to take then 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.160
 when you look at this beautiful way of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.160
 say me up and radhames 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.780
 if it is that I am here good the other 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.240
 why I'm celebrating 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.410
 is that it exceeds the barrier of 400 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.900
 subscribers 6 400 more than 400 those who 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.470
 you are subscribed to my channel and I am 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.670
 pretty happy I'm pretty 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.040
 excited and good 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.840
 no special has been made either 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.660
 because I have not come up with anything 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.459
 original and good if not if I do not know 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.830
 nothing original happens, I do not think 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.290
 be of those who have to do something 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.340
 because if not then then 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.630
 I'm not very disturbed by the idea of not 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.300
 have a special why 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.970
 I have not come up with anything special 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.240
 properly said in our after 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.830
 to do something to do it because neither 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.200
 I did not like it either, I do not think either 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.220
 well do something to do it 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.110
 and good now they have me tell me to fuck 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.489
 have gone up anything to have done 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.800
 Anything if we settle for 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.810
 any good tune, well, that's 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.060
 your point of view I think that if 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.150
 you do something you do it right or you do not do it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.330
 at least all the good that happened all 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.220
 well that you can afford 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.530
 and well it is not the case that I have 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 nothing happened special so take 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.740
 neither does anything come in so 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.870
 I take this opportunity to celebrate the 400 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.810
 subscribers with with the video of this 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.160
 late not my birthday because I take advantage 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.290
 it will be a one celebration ' this word 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.600
 there is good in the end 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.450
 that out there on the other hand be 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.320
 boiling already you will have seen a very uncle 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.480
 majo with a spear kikos this chapter of 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.350
 the series is me yes but it's being 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.009
 played with 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.409
 I'm not playing with 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.099
 with the m-40 that is not normal in this 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.960
 series and I tell you it is not normal that there 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.639
 caught this gun but something happened to me very 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.909
 curious when it ends and good when 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.620
 I thought ending is what bad luck, uncle 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.600
 shoot just when I'm pulling 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.600
 and of course he commits suicide like an asshole 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.369
 if it does not stretch so well then what 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.839
 this series is not very consistent that the 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.069
 I'm playing with this gun but good 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.079
 As I'm telling you, something happened to me a lot 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.799
 curious when he thought he had finished the 

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:15.809
 series when it reaches rank 55 it happened to me 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:17.719
 something very curious that is that when I went to 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:20.009
 see the statistics to show you what 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.309
 proportion had at the end of the series 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.679
 no longer I already believed that I had finished 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:28.399
 no and good when I realized when 

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:31.859
 I entered already you will see it because it is recorded 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:35.279
 when I came in, I said of hosts but if 

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:36.809
 one level remains then as the 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.779
 last level of had or is the last 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:41.099
 starting when I was left that was very 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.389
 curious because I had to take two to 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.119
 back because one thought I was going to 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.120
 finish and I stayed at 11 points I stayed 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:50.370
 11 upload points 55 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.979
 I had to throw another game so throw 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.199
 two games with the m-40 and when 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.560
 I finished when I entered and I realized that 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.060
 missing a level to rise in prestige 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.010
 it does not stop reaching the first prestige 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.790
 I decided to play all the level that I 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.320
 was missing only with the m-40 so 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.620
 Well, this is one of those games 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.570
 today I have about 1,900 left or 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.190
 1,400 points I do not know how many are left 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.730
 exactly that is what they come to be 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.010
 three games or there or four in a 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.230
 case that has gone very wrong and good 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.880
 this is just this is ending like this 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.040
 that nothing I hope you like we passed 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.300
 this afternoon the base assembly filters and 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.300
 until the next chao chao
