what<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.519> sounds<00:03:24.790> like<00:03:24.850> ALB<00:03:25.300> accomplice<00:03:25.870> Oh

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.149 

hope<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.390> initiate<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.930> Alpha<00:03:30.200> counter<00:03:30.560> yeah

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
hope to initiate the Alpha counter yeah

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.119 
hope to initiate the Alpha counter yeah
but<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.780> amake<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.709> they'll<00:03:33.980> have

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
but in this amake in there they'll have

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.250 
but in this amake in there they'll have
to<00:03:34.219> be<00:03:34.400> through<00:03:34.609> scenarios<00:03:34.909> going<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:35.569> for<00:03:36.079> one

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
to be through scenarios going on for one

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.020 
to be through scenarios going on for one
you<00:03:36.439> have<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.680> have<00:03:36.890> kicked<00:03:37.129> your<00:03:37.280> pawns<00:03:37.700> ass

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
you have to have kicked your pawns ass

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.390 
you have to have kicked your pawns ass
so<00:03:38.719> you<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.290> know<00:03:39.409> how<00:03:39.439> to<00:03:39.560> initiate<00:03:39.950> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
so you have to know how to initiate the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.580 
so you have to know how to initiate the
simpler<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.030> ultimate<00:03:41.810> super<00:03:42.170> three<00:03:42.920> you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
simpler the ultimate super three you

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.379 
simpler the ultimate super three you
need<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.739> do<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.099> with<00:03:46.879> a<00:03:46.909> hair<00:03:47.120> long

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
need to do it with a hair long

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.530 
need to do it with a hair long
fractional<00:03:47.930> power<00:03:48.219> and<00:03:49.219> also<00:03:49.969> you<00:03:50.150> will<00:03:50.299> need

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
fractional power and also you will need

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.500
