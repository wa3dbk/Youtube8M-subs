let's<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.399> that<00:00:32.399> was<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.669> reach<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.890> then

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
let's see that was my reach and then

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.900 
let's see that was my reach and then
goddamn<00:00:37.770> okay<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.700> where<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
goddamn okay then that was where I

reached when I jumped so now I honestly
think<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.050> could<00:00:43.200> touch<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> dot<00:00:43.860> hopefully<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
think I could touch that dot hopefully I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
think I could touch that dot hopefully I
can<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> imma<00:00:46.350> take<00:00:46.530> three<00:00:46.860> jumps<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can so imma take three jumps that is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100 
can so imma take three jumps that is
difference<00:01:10.979> between<00:01:11.010> day<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.700> day<00:01:12.110> 7

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
difference between day one and day 7

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.300 
difference between day one and day 7
which<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> second<00:01:14.189> week<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
which is a second week that's about I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
which is a second week that's about I
think<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> half<00:01:17.670> inches<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
think one and a half inches I'm going to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
think one and a half inches I'm going to
try<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> touch<00:01:19.350> touch<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> top<00:01:20.759> line<00:01:21.000> because

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
try to touch touch the top line because

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
try to touch touch the top line because
I<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.570> drew<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.490> somewhat<00:01:23.490> touch<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I think I drew to somewhat touch that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:45.050 
I think I drew to somewhat touch that
one<00:01:24.030> zoomed<00:01:24.360> in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.160 

you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.230 

so<00:01:50.860> as<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.159> can<00:01:51.310> see<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.560> close<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.240> two

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
so as you can see that is close to two

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.830 
so as you can see that is close to two
and<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.509> half<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.880> almost<00:02:01.240> two<00:02:01.390> and<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.659> half

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
and a half got almost two and a half

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.080 
and a half got almost two and a half
inches<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.850> point<00:02:04.090> 27<00:02:04.540> inches<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.820> now<00:02:06.940> my

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
inches to point 27 inches so now my

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.110 
inches to point 27 inches so now my
vertical<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.570> 26<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:11.880> know<00:02:12.880> I'm<00:02:12.970> gonna

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
vertical is 26 and you know I'm gonna

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:22.630 
vertical is 26 and you know I'm gonna
say<00:02:13.270> twenty<00:02:13.510> six<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> half<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.290> now

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.480
