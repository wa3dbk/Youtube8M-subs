didn't<00:02:38.260> break<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.650> well<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.280> did<00:02:39.430> write<00:02:39.610> it

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.860 

the<00:02:43.260> piece<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.590> holds<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.250> your<00:02:45.400> visor<00:02:45.870> let's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the piece that holds on your visor let's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.380 
the piece that holds on your visor let's
call<00:02:47.050> them<00:02:47.200> about<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.280> base<00:02:48.520> mounting<00:02:49.150> plate

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
call them about the base mounting plate

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.350 
call them about the base mounting plate
I<00:02:49.630> think<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:49.990> called<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.670> was<00:02:52.150> moving

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I think it's called that it was moving

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.170 
I think it's called that it was moving
around<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:54.190> broken<00:02:54.430> due<00:02:54.880> to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
around and it was it broken due to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
around and it was it broken due to
normal<00:02:55.690> wear<00:02:56.040> normal<00:02:57.040> usage

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.180

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
so it was devastating since I about a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.009 
so it was devastating since I about a
five<00:03:03.489> hundred<00:03:03.550> dollars<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.690> broke<00:03:04.840> it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
like a month or two later and I even

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.270 
like a month or two later and I even
broke<00:03:07.659> it<00:03:07.810> more<00:03:08.019> because<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.560> try<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.920> tighten

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
shay lane split let's see there is a

it'd<00:05:27.080> be<00:05:27.200> better<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:28.040> lane<00:05:28.220> split<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:30.530> know<00:05:30.620> it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
it'd be better to lane split you know it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.289 
it'd be better to lane split you know it
I'll<00:05:30.830> go<00:05:30.980> straight<00:05:31.840> yeah<00:05:32.840> I'll<00:05:33.050> go<00:05:33.170> straight
