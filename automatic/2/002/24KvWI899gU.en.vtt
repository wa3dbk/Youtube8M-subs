00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.319
 Hello everyone, I found a more or less even 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 nowhere on the road 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 stop let's look at 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.000
 clearance chevrolet niva because it 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.060
 just the case when the manufacturer 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.789
 In my a little ability is underestimated 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.000
 your car indicates a figure of 200 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.160
 millimeters to me after I climbed 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 where I would never stick at 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.219
 one SUV a 200 millimeter is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.649
 such a parquet northern figure 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.180
 not at all off-road and chevrolet niva 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.280
 us 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 present road compact everything he has 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 alright so let's look in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 really here in 1 metal 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.920
 protection here here is this part of the bumper she 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.190
 removed under it square will use q 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 respectively 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.000
 I think what I squeak there bright and alive 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.239
 after I climbed then scored 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.119
 just from some boredom and snow to the best 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.850
 this is all you have too waiting here will not 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.010
 dare to protect and then will shake and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.369
 as if something falls off at you 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.650
 apparently that's all you have 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.720
 falls off it doesn't fall off all 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
 only on the march and the ice and snow that is needed 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.460
 scrub so that he does not hang out 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 problem at least I already had time 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 scared that I tore off protection but here 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.299
 to tear it off I don't know what you need 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.829
 do let's see everyone waiting 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.860
 centimeters lower point there like us 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.909
 We see that too seriously shifted from the crankcase 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.039
 all of us 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.439
 ok so here before the bolts here are the bolts by 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.240
 the middle of the car is just twenty with 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.450
 a few millimeters but plus here 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.780
 minus centimeter seems to me that is 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.240
 I believe there are no questions at all. 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520
 I just like there will be no questions sooner 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.490
 total and scavengers front suspension 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.030
 what is here as it usually happens here 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.520
 200 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.539
 there is even these 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.599
 wheels this here we have 19 centimeters but 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.760
 as you understand plus meter most likely 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:22.810
 20 so let's see from the side 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.970
 I 'll see you all pretty 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 highly single pair question 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:36.370
 call here here's a silencer twenty 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 six twenty five twenty six very 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.549
 a lot of good you can not worry 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.060
 and here is a silencer silencer here 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:50.500
 just it seems as though smallish but 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.720
 he is 26 cm and his friends are very, very 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.400
 logo 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.069
 lowest point in the back and and from here 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.940
 it is clearly visible this is the rear axle and the rear one 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.180
 reducer cooling bridge color us 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.889
 rear gear let's watch 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.440
 we will look at him most likely 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.989
 female know if everything can be walked 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 my support will be ok 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.110
 us 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.940
 Here we look how much we have here 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.700
 customer rear 20 to 120 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.340
 that is, all this we have indicated 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.250
 chevrolet niva very true front 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.790
 protection is eaten by a little clearance and in 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.150
 In principle, in the rest of the places here everything 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.790
 not even bad and the most important thing is that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.440
 tear off at school which is basically all 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 protected by 22 centimeters note 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.050
 that here we also have protection on y 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.870
 us about the sound of the frame that is all 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.510
 here it is monolithic if that bumper 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.170
 vassal protects a little muffler 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.990
 highly muffler away just due 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.980
 the fact that he is high with us is so high and 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.320
 trunk floor here tank spare tire they are not 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.400
 began to post but also own 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.760
 There was nowhere for their consideration but those 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.820
 less she is at the door and does not get in the way here 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.970
 we end up with a lot of empty space 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.770
 free space but if so 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.389
 will look ahead here too draw 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.090
 Attention 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.090
 im gimmick which comes in two parts 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.819
 its center differential is exactly that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.689
 the most that if something is blocked my 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:36.569
 permanent permanent all-wheel drive 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:39.029
 the constant goes a moment back and forth and 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.689
 it basically sets it aside in 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.800
 the side 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.319
 that chevrolet niva we have not road builders with 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.860
 permanent all-wheel drive and draw 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:53.460
 attention to the cut and which are minimal 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.270
 what's in front what's behind and see the ride 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.430
 part of the road where I am beautiful 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.740
 this will demonstrate my review on this 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.620
 clearance 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.529
 off-road some aspects 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:12.180
 static we finish all thanks for 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.849
