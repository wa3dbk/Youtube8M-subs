Alan<00:00:00.960> not<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.260> winning<00:00:01.500> start<00:00:01.829> you<00:00:01.949> were

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
Alan not the winning start you were

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.740 
Alan not the winning start you were
dreaming<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.760> but<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.210> great<00:00:03.449> point

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
dreaming of but a great point

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.769 
dreaming of but a great point
nonetheless<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> great<00:00:05.100> performance<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
nonetheless and a great performance I

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.210 
nonetheless and a great performance I
thought<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:06.930> was<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.140> periods<00:00:07.859> during<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
thought that was the periods during the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.549 
thought that was the periods during the
game<00:00:08.370> when<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.550> played<00:00:08.820> extremely<00:00:09.179> well<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:10.170> was

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
game when we played extremely well I was

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.350 
game when we played extremely well I was
disappointed<00:00:10.679> when<00:00:11.340> half<00:00:11.550> time<00:00:11.580> Kim<00:00:12.120> because

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
disappointed when half time Kim because

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.629 
disappointed when half time Kim because
I<00:00:12.480> felt<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.139> were<00:00:13.290> very<00:00:14.009> much<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.490> control

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I felt that we were very much in control

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.859 
I felt that we were very much in control
the<00:00:15.120> game<00:00:15.299> before<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.529> got<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> gall<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
the game before we got the gall and

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.080 
the game before we got the gall and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
right on till halftime I thought a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.310 
right on till halftime I thought a
little<00:00:21.210> bit<00:00:21.390> careless<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> ball<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
tames in a second half and we lost a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.250 
tames in a second half and we lost a
little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.109> control<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:27.260> you

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
little bit of that control but we you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the game was going to go but the side

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
the game was going to go but the side
reacted<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.590> quickly<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.219> well<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
reacted so quickly and so well to that
and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.239> sort<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.930> dominated<00:00:55.500> possession

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and then sort of dominated possession

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
and then sort of dominated possession
for<00:00:56.100> probably<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> rest<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> game<00:00:57.539> yeah<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
for probably the rest of the game yeah I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.250 
for probably the rest of the game yeah I
think<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.559> did<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:59.370> thought<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.109> it<00:01:01.109> was

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
think they did I thought that was it was

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
think they did I thought that was it was
hopelessly<00:01:01.620> difficult<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.579> we're

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
hopelessly difficult to start as we're

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.340 
hopelessly difficult to start as we're
going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> magnificent<00:01:03.539> strike

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
going to get was a magnificent strike

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.109 
going to get was a magnificent strike
from<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> ball<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> chemo<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
from the from the ball that chemo and

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.170 
from the from the ball that chemo and
clearly<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> said<00:01:10.740> before<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.369> believe<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
clearly as I said before I believe that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
clearly as I said before I believe that
that<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> very<00:01:13.200> bad<00:01:13.439> effect<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:14.100> his<00:01:14.280> last

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that had a very bad effect on his last

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539 
that had a very bad effect on his last
ye<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.630> lads<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.470> shown<00:01:16.710> great<00:01:16.740> spirit

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
ye on the lads have shown great spirit

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.749 
ye on the lads have shown great spirit
to<00:01:17.700> come<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:19.110> deal<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.280> looked

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to come back to deal with that it looked

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
to come back to deal with that it looked
as<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> didn't<00:01:21.360> faze<00:01:21.509> him<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> they

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
as if it didn't faze him at all and they

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
as if it didn't faze him at all and they
go<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> game<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.360> was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
go on with the game and and that was

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
go on with the game and and that was
really<00:01:24.689> important<00:01:25.320> because<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.890> will<00:01:26.070> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
really important because we will go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
really important because we will go
behind<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:27.030> times<00:01:27.330> during<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> season<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
behind at times during the season and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.649 
behind at times during the season and
we've<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.270> realize

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
we've got to make sure that we realize

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.830 
we've got to make sure that we realize
it<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> always<00:01:31.650> come<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> say

from it well I think everyone could see
that<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.550> when<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:15.000> either<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.570> free<00:03:15.900> kick

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
that you know when we either a free kick

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.070 
that you know when we either a free kick
towards<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.010> end<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.490> pushed<00:03:18.030> your<00:03:18.600> nurse<00:03:18.840> and

towards the end I pushed your nurse and
Craig<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> tacit<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.810> i<00:03:21.840> think<00:03:22.200> it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
Craig up to go on a tacit so i think it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.870 
Craig up to go on a tacit so i think it
was<00:03:22.380> fairly<00:03:22.590> clear<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> wasn't<00:03:23.220> settling

was fairly clear that I wasn't settling
for<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.120> point<00:03:24.440> I'm<00:03:25.440> disappointed<00:03:25.830> because

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
for the point I'm disappointed because

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.050 
for the point I'm disappointed because
we<00:03:27.180> were<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.540> close<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:28.110> getting<00:03:28.260> three<00:03:28.590> points

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
we were so close to getting three points

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.060
