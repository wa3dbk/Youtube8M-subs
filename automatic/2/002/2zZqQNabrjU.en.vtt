the<00:00:15.690> Scout<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.230> long<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.529> he<00:00:16.619> possibly<00:00:16.770> can

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the Scout as long as he possibly can

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.750 
the Scout as long as he possibly can
while<00:00:17.940> his<00:00:18.180> lair<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.779> coming<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.760> heroes

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
while his lair is coming up and heroes

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
while his lair is coming up and heroes
layers<00:00:21.029> coming<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.510> as<00:00:21.630> well<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.199> think

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
layers coming up as well so I think

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.470 
layers coming up as well so I think
heroes<00:00:22.680> layer<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.220> probably<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> be

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
heroes layer is probably going to be

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
heroes layer is probably going to be
ahead<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.720> j<00:00:24.960> dongs<00:00:25.109> layer<00:00:25.410> since<00:00:25.710> she<00:00:25.769> put

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
ahead of j dongs layer since she put
down<00:00:26.160> his<00:00:26.369> gas<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.910> both<00:00:30.390> guys<00:00:30.599> are

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
he's running in more zerglings so this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
earlier for Jae dong is very interesting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.580 
earlier for Jae dong is very interesting
i'm<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.470> sure<00:01:46.970> why<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.509> hero<00:01:49.049> had<00:01:49.380> his

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
i'm not sure why because a hero had his

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.179 
i'm not sure why because a hero had his
gas<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:50.040> earlier<00:01:50.340> i<00:01:50.430> believe<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.799> both<00:01:52.979> guys

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
gas up earlier i believe but both guys

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.510 
gas up earlier i believe but both guys
have<00:01:53.430> their<00:01:53.640> expansions<00:01:54.270> mining<00:01:55.259> both<00:01:56.189> have

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
have their expansions mining both have

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.810 
have their expansions mining both have
the<00:01:56.850> entire<00:01:57.180> Scout<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.409> upcoming<00:01:58.560> spires

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.569 
so there's no telling where this game is
going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.380> jane<00:02:04.979> hong<00:02:05.100> lost<00:02:05.399> an

the amount of circlings that jaedong has

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.130 
the amount of circlings that jaedong has
out<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.100> but<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.370> jaedong<00:03:02.790> has<00:03:03.390> some<00:03:03.780> euless

out here but now jaedong has some euless
out<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:05.130> we'll<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.330> okay<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.390> looks<00:03:06.420> like

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
out and we'll see okay it looks like

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.840 
out and we'll see okay it looks like
hero<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.470> spawning<00:03:07.830> medalists<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.519> his<00:03:08.700> own

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
hero is spawning medalists of his own

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.610 
hero is spawning medalists of his own
but<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.300> he's<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> little<00:03:09.630> bit<00:03:09.840> behind<00:03:10.170> as

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
but I think he's a little bit behind as

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.220 
but I think he's a little bit behind as
far<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:10.950> military<00:03:11.430> count<00:03:12.060> goes<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.630> jailing

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
far as military count goes and jailing

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.020 
far as military count goes and jailing
is<00:03:13.350> using<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.280> his<00:03:14.430> advantage<00:03:14.850> by

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
is using this and his advantage by

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
is using this and his advantage by
picking<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.780> overlord<00:03:16.200> that's<00:03:16.440> going

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
picking off this overlord that's going

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
picking off this overlord that's going
to<00:03:16.680> force<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.160> hero<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.000> build<00:03:18.360> another

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
to force a hero to build another

down<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.820> some<00:03:24.299> awesome<00:03:24.750> micro<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.890> a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
down to some awesome micro I think if a

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.840 
down to some awesome micro I think if a
hero<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.239> hero<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.900> somehow<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:29.430> deal

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
hero I think if hero can somehow I deal

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.270 
hero I think if hero can somehow I deal
with<00:03:30.000> those<00:03:30.269> zerglings<00:03:31.079> at<00:03:31.260> j<00:03:31.440> dongs<00:03:31.620> natural

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
with those zerglings at j dongs natural

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.069 
with those zerglings at j dongs natural
expansion<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.880> run<00:03:33.030> his<00:03:33.209> own<00:03:33.360> zerglings<00:03:33.870> into

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
expansion and run his own zerglings into

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
expansion and run his own zerglings into
the<00:03:34.170> main<00:03:34.350> he'll<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> good<00:03:35.400> position<00:03:35.640> but

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the main he'll be in a good position but

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400 
the main he'll be in a good position but
other<00:03:36.150> than<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.540> think<00:03:36.660> he's<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.079> behind

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
other than that I think he's just behind

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.380 
other than that I think he's just behind
as<00:03:37.950> far<00:03:38.220> as<00:03:38.310> everything<00:03:38.519> goes<00:03:38.880> here<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.150> Jae

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
as far as everything goes here and Jae

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.750 
as far as everything goes here and Jae
dong<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.810> hovering<00:03:40.230> around<00:03:40.410> his<00:03:40.680> base<00:03:40.890> always

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
dong is hovering around his base always

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.819 
dong is hovering around his base always
picking<00:03:42.120> off<00:03:42.239> another<00:03:42.510> overlord<00:03:43.049> there<00:03:43.290> so

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
picking off another overlord there so

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.949 
picking off another overlord there so
that's<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.160> good<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.820> looks<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.660> hero

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
that's not good so it looks like hero

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.020 
that's not good so it looks like hero
it's<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.920> use<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.400> opportunity<00:03:47.670> to

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's going to use this opportunity to

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.880 
it's going to use this opportunity to
pick<00:03:48.299> off<00:03:48.480> some<00:03:48.690> overlords<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.320> his<00:03:49.500> own<00:03:49.650> but

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
pick off some overlords of his own but

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.370 
pick off some overlords of his own but
this<00:03:50.220> means<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.880> jaedong<00:03:51.420> now<00:03:51.690> knows<00:03:52.049> where

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
this means that jaedong now knows where

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.680 
this means that jaedong now knows where
the<00:03:52.470> medalists<00:03:52.859> are<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.280> hero<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:54.420> he's<00:03:54.570> going

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
the medalists are for hero so he's going

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
all I have a feeling it's going to be an

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.370 
all I have a feeling it's going to be an
air<00:04:05.250> battle<00:04:05.459> as<00:04:05.730> well<00:04:05.940> heroes<00:04:06.870> not<00:04:07.109> even

air battle as well heroes not even

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.460

mining<00:04:07.739> minerals<00:04:07.920> at<00:04:08.250> his<00:04:08.430> natural<00:04:08.850> expansion

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
mining minerals at his natural expansion

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.590 
mining minerals at his natural expansion
it's<00:04:10.470> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.709> odd<00:04:10.950> he<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.459> using<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.359> gas

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
it's kind of odd he is using it the gas

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.300 
it's kind of odd he is using it the gas
though<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.290> he's<00:04:13.410> definitely<00:04:13.560> getting<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:14.130> lot

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
though so he's definitely getting a lot

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.060 
though so he's definitely getting a lot
of<00:04:14.340> moolah<00:04:14.730> sout<00:04:15.079> he's<00:04:16.079> not<00:04:16.320> committing<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.919> a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
of moolah sout he's not committing to a

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.009 
of moolah sout he's not committing to a
ton<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.549> zerglings<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.150> now<00:04:18.209> jaedong<00:04:18.750> is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
ton of zerglings and now jaedong is

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.529 
ton of zerglings and now jaedong is
going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:20.070> wow<00:04:20.310> he's<00:04:20.640> splitting<00:04:21.000> up<00:04:21.239> his

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
going to wow he's splitting up his

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.600 
going to wow he's splitting up his
zerglings<00:04:22.289> kind<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:22.979> a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
zerglings kind of in a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.850 
zerglings kind of in a
two<00:04:23.939> pronged<00:04:24.300> attack<00:04:24.780> here<00:04:25.319> I<00:04:25.349> think<00:04:25.500> maybe

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
two pronged attack here I think maybe

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.980 
two pronged attack here I think maybe
he's<00:04:26.009> just<00:04:26.129> a<00:04:26.370> scouting<00:04:26.789> here<00:04:27.120> looking<00:04:27.780> for

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
he's just a scouting here looking for

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.270 
he's just a scouting here looking for
those<00:04:28.110> mute<00:04:28.319> lists<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.680> might<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.919> incoming

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
those mute lists that might be incoming

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.490 
those mute lists that might be incoming
yeah<00:04:29.909> I<00:04:29.939> was<00:04:30.150> going<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.449> say<00:04:30.629> that<00:04:30.900> would<00:04:31.020> be<00:04:31.229> a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
yeah I was going to say that would be a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.320 
yeah I was going to say that would be a
pretty<00:04:31.889> awesome<00:04:32.069> attack<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.759> just<00:04:32.939> ran<00:04:33.150> in

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
pretty awesome attack we just ran in

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.510 
pretty awesome attack we just ran in
circles<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.900> from<00:04:34.199> two<00:04:34.469> prongs<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.069> a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
circles in from two prongs and a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.709 
circles in from two prongs and a
technical<00:04:35.729> this<00:04:35.939> medalists<00:04:36.360> at<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.539> same

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
technical this medalists at the same

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.469 
technical this medalists at the same
time<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.800> looks<00:04:37.949> like<00:04:38.099> he<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:39.240> up

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
time it looks like he is going up

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.379 
time it looks like he is going up
probably<00:04:40.469> with<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.650> medalist<00:04:41.069> to<00:04:41.189> scout<00:04:41.460> with

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
probably with the medalist to scout with

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.119 
probably with the medalist to scout with
this<00:04:42.569> muted<00:04:42.840> his<00:04:42.960> pack<00:04:43.229> no<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:43.860> looks<00:04:44.009> like<00:04:44.099> a

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
this muted his pack no it looks like a

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.740 
this muted his pack no it looks like a
zergling<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.699> circlings<00:04:45.090> going<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.479> to<00:04:45.659> get

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
zergling the circlings going in to get

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.689 
zergling the circlings going in to get
the<00:04:45.900> scout<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.319> everything<00:04:46.710> or<00:04:46.949> heroes

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
the scout and everything or heroes

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.869 
the scout and everything or heroes
picking<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.180> zergling<00:04:48.599> off<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:50.639> now<00:04:50.759> it

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
picking that zergling off and now it

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.189 
picking that zergling off and now it
looks<00:04:50.969> like<00:04:51.090> gentling<00:04:51.569> is<00:04:51.659> going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> commit

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
looks like gentling is going to commit

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.719 
looks like gentling is going to commit
to<00:04:52.349> an<00:04:52.439> attack<00:04:52.740> he's<00:04:52.979> bringing<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:53.520> the
