 m 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.220
 they work with five modules 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.430
 they are equally necessary and discreet then fall into the passenger compartment of the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.150
 vehicle in which they operate 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.560
 they do what the whistle shone with pinocho 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.570
 place in the consciousness of the pilots 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.800
 book hotels and confirm trips observe witnesses and create the terrat 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.480
 delicious 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.320
 they spend half their lives away from home they are people and languages ​​always like shadows 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.900
 Attentive to the famous drivers 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.040
 do not know what is dizzy in a car have good memory and better view but 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.300
 above all they are the best fans of their own sport 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.730
 they love the races and their particular emotion 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.050
 with the pilot time and formal co-pilot an often indissoluble marriage 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.420
 nobody remembers aviation yes yes it came to cancún in felt in years leaks if 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.300
 go dead 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.940
 yes possibly even today that the Spanish co-pilot par excellence 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 according to Carlos Sainz 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.560
 no driver I think he first talked about the fbc especially 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.960
 oo a friend 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.920
 but you have to think that it's a team that defends the pilot is the one who drives 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 but leave co-pilot 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050
 objects you could not go you could not 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.340
 to compete then being the complement because he is part of the team 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.180
 fundamental the co-pilot the people have since the psoe is a frustrated pilot is 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.140
 a pilot who could not become a pilot and a co-pilot 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 I think there's something of fame going through imagination to become 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.510
 World rally driver what the delegations from this month 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.229
 he closed the rally world racer

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.790
 as a proposal to society 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.450
 for me to go and that's why is to put is the best driver I'll come back

 in the interior of Toyota they travel around 120 thousand kilometers per year 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.849
 or what is the same happens in almost six thousand hours pending the past what 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.999
 keeps them away from Spain eight months each year 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.259
 so much time together and both makes their backs of the 70 that has run Luis 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.849
 in 32 years behind the wheel, it has taken them some difficulties, although both 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.739
 the most delicate moments are rendered dramatic and they have to qualify them as 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.659
 justito

 adventures adventure up tourism is a lot 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.739
 I remember a heroic act 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.480
 despite the fact that the amendment to return the oar, the famous 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.709
 vanity would turn an ankle ronding intoning then I could not get in two 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.709
 stretches of the torino area and bury them abandoned 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.389
 that I passed discussion we placed the known neighbors today we would have the 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.549
 ideal Galician there was a fog the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.279

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.259
 free meters 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.419
 said in a very fast way and street that wants more unity 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.989
 and that is crowned a grade 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.339
 we had exhausted to spend it in fifth 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:28.109
 well the mind was composed could pass almost opponents I sang the before the 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:28.969

 perform marches based on your arms 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.050
 and passed as if they had not arrived with insurance that we arrived at

 last aldama does not seem very big to everyone else 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.650
 and says that this truce scratches 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.650
 there yes that happened to me many bills of the andes 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.559
 the Finn very easy to take a scare because many voters 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.659
 and you never know what you're going to fly and that the lawyer's lawyers inside 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.989

 40% of the querétaro 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.959
 but it can be easy 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.039
 finish 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.729
 the tomato cucumber

 Linares has declared today we have learned everything about new Indian delhi by 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.139
 the night while hundreds of bottles 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.239
 and there he looked through the window at that time in it the trees of the tree 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.009
 very large is expensive but already the gifts to the poor 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.680
 if we know something about how he stuck all the floor of the car and everyone who goes 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.509
 to tell them where we would get eliminated but george gillet 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.430
 I think that since the day that passes, I find myself 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.690
 I can stop moving by giving an example of what can run 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.729
 hard-core reader nfl the same day is not yet 30 years old 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.729
 Speak English 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.880
 Portuguese and Italian is almost almost the official language of the world championship 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.490
 has chosen his profession and does not feel like a failed pilot because he has never 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.779
 called the attention that simplicity since he started he did sitting in the 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.059
 which now occupies 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.599
 it's a profession like gawker 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.789
 I really like the copilot 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.529
 they got me as a pilot and I love 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.439
 I like it because I never do it coach gustavo a 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.029
 because it embodies when achieving significant savings past losses in the car 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:23.980
 of those 12 hours 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.520
 we do not rest 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.809
 but to be able to eat 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.209
 but that's the bad part of the vouchers how nice is when the day of the 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.900
 career 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.589
 from the moment they take their place august ads 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.229
 a copilot can lose a rali but win it 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.610
 only pilots can win 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.879
 it is a professional assumption of modesty and a confirmed fact in the competition 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.430
 from there he develops his work that starts at home and has just given 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:54.779
 before it will be ready 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.109
 then I from my home madrid I tried to approach with a map of 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.060
 of the area where it's going to be the other way around once you have a map the 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.259

 and the length kilometers 2 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.750
 then you have to program yourself between them to be moved with a plan so that 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.119
 when we get all 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.729
 we are in proceedings we have already done all the hotels reserved once 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.469
 We arrived in Dalí, because I brought the notes and we have them from previous years
