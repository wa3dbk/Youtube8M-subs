00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.699
 Xuxa 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.160
 It was here, give a photo, people who 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.820
 they are speaking - welcome everyone to 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.980
 one more video of black ops 23 10 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.320
 questions and order you 're not talking bad 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.880
 of black it is necessary to add to that to join 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.340
 that's the way I left my mom gugu 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.170
 Good guys, I'm not complaining 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.210
 game that the game is bad then complaining 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.710
 of the connection of the game that you could 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.870
 it's not just me I 'm always a 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.610
 problem, a lot of people are with 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 same problem as me the latter 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 update on improved somewhat seems 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.260
 but it's still far from being the game 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.050
 ideal for people to play and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.239
 have fun but talking about fun and I 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 I'm trying to set aside the TDM that 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.739
 as the mastered Chue stumps am 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.110
 starting to play other modalities 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.790
 and then I can manage to have fun 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.590
 little in this game 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.329
 one of them is your debut show that I 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.250
 I arrived yesterday basically at night 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.479
 The whole night was three or four hours. 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.700
 that I played closing the road to me 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.830
 fun as hell was very cool 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.840
 games legal place game became much 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 wrong but also a lot of mess 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 It was a lot of fun to be playing. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.810
 see if I can bring some game 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.340
 for you of your ancestors that I 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.750
 I ended up participating, right? 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.210
 I think you're going to play, I was playing 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.250
 sniper was really fun even more 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.320
 Let's talk there something cool that has 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 no black options that practically do not have 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.060
 almost nobody playing I tried to play 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 today a lot of people are playing 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 especially I say people in the case 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.900
 Brazilian, right? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.909
 since I have to search the room and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.890
 delay to the room to assemble the 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.590
 hospital and turns around and sometimes you 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.140
 gets those the intermat of black 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 on black album aquino black ops two 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.080
 I do not know the name as that is the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.330
 internet but are the matches plus 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.729
 different modalities and this modality 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.890
 here I am playing the game of weapons 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.360
 What happens you start with a gun 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.659
 every time you killed your opponent 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.760
 You change your weapon until you reach the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.490
 last to be 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.830
 the evening snacks would be the basic 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.410
 cross bull and the stab list that is the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.540
 last weapon and all the opponents you 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.030
 You have to kill every enemy you kill. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 you by the sea but if you take a 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.820
 stab 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 you come back the previous milestone is pretty cool 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.800
 It's a pity that there is not much 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.020
 brazilian playing like this was a part 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.490
 well, it's a really good start as soon as I 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.430
 I got to play I played some other 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.110
 matches also win some lost 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.550
 many also had guys playing 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.440
 Good luck and the escaleta stayed in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.700
 second place in that match that he 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.410
 I was playing pretty well in this 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.650
 here we were more or 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.050
 least well balanced but at the end 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.600
 I just managed to stand out in the head. 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.310
 overcoming it was really fun so I 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.290
 I'm really enjoying playing these 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.060
 arrangements a little different since 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.170
 he does not always play the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 same things 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 and it seems the connection is a bit 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.020
 better in their modalities here I do not 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.580
 I know if it's my impression but I played it 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.330
 today it also seems to improve the connection 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.610
 is not more of those caught 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.410
 not give so much state leg back yard but it is 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.630
 much less so I do not know if it 's because 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.010
 there are fewer people in the room and know 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.950
 maritime connection that ends up working 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.750
 with improvement only of him without fear doing 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 A gift that the Indian RPG 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.570
 good personal video is almost at the end 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.910
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.470
 I ended up capturing this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.120
 twitter gameplay then there is no end 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.910
 What I want but I edited one 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.830
 did a little gambiarra there and 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.510
 I ended up failing what I want 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.000
 What are you going to see now with the beagle? 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.950
 But anyway I 'm just to see you and a teacher. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.480
 to accompany the beauty so I thought 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.130
 thank you very much for the company 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.720
 We'll see you in the next video and not 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.780
 forget to play this mode is very 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 cool and maybe we will meet 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.630
 over there 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.630
