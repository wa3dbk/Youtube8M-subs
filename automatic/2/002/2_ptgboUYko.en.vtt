I<00:00:35.470> mean<00:00:35.560> the<00:00:35.740> track<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.100> layouts<00:00:36.430> perfect

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
I mean the track the layouts perfect

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.640 
I mean the track the layouts perfect
it's<00:00:37.060> tight<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.540> it's<00:00:37.660> got<00:00:37.780> inside<00:00:38.170> outsides

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
it's tight and it's got inside outsides

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.560 
it's tight and it's got inside outsides
where<00:00:39.010> you're<00:00:39.580> forced<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:39.970> go<00:00:40.030> inside<00:00:40.420> or

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
where you're forced to go inside or

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.000 
where you're forced to go inside or
outside<00:00:40.690> there's<00:00:41.080> no<00:00:41.200> middle<00:00:41.530> zone<00:00:41.740> so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
outside there's no middle zone so

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.680 
outside there's no middle zone so
that'll<00:00:42.280> make<00:00:42.400> it<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.610> really<00:00:42.910> good<00:00:43.090> racing<00:00:43.540> and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.760 
behind me for a reason then I have all
the<00:01:13.450> talent<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.900> takes<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.320> go<00:01:14.440> out<00:01:14.500> there<00:01:14.680> and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the talent it takes to go out there and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.800

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.100 
same as brothers and the track might
have<00:01:55.060> been<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.180> little<00:01:55.330> different<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.870> didn't
