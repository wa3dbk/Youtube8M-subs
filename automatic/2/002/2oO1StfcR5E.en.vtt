 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.560
 Well the first thing is to see how many bytes 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.930
 is our system for that we're going to 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.930
 team after to system properties 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.810
 good in my case is a 32 system 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.810
 xd bytes 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.740
 good with that information we are going to 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.829
 download the emulator from the page of the 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.769
 video description 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.260
 is the official page of the xd emulator and 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.719
 on the page we downloaded the emulator in 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.940
 my case the 32 bytes and you 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.920
 download the one that your system supports 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.920

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.350
 We wait 5 seconds to start the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.350
 download and we save it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 already downloaded we go where we have 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.259
 saved in my case is the folder of 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.259
 downloads 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.910

 Right click on the mouse and extract it in 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.420
 your folder 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.890
 we will see a folder with the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.350
 emulator inside we open it and we create 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.350
 a new folder called roms 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 we open it and this is where the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 games of our emulator 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.280

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.909

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.710
 we look for the name of our game and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.710
 we break in the name 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.689

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.689

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.470
 rivers that pass the entire winrar file 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.350

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.820
 they open 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.130
 and start emulation of the game 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.270
 [Music] 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.430

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.370
 recording xd 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.070

 and then to frei mesquite and select the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.720
 number they want by higher be 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.300
 the fastest number will work for them 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.510
 if it still works very slowly they are going to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.940
 trust new emulation settings 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.800
 they click on it and mark the option with a 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.980

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.220
