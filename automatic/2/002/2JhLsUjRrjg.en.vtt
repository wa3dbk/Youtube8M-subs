00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello how are you welcome to all of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.060
 new to my channel today I bring you a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.150
 review about mac correctors me 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 several noises were asked by the subscribers 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
 the proofreaders since I'm trying to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 do the videos as soon as I can I 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 complicated but I try to do more 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 It has six different correctors inside 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.610
 of those six correctors you have three 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.570
 pallets 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.640
 include 6 3 and 6 correctors each 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.380
 the three palettes are the same concealer 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 but with different shades the first one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.350
 I'm going to show you is the studio finish 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.150
 reconcile this is in the tone in that 35 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.240
 this one because corrector has protection 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.280
 solar 35 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.280
 It is a creamy concealer 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.900
 super creamy 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.610
 your appetizer now that you have a 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.100
 pretty important coverage but it's 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.700
 heavy has two cons to use 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 under the eyes one that is heavy and 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.530
 another one that has solar protection the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.590
 sunscreen is basically dioxide 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.870
 of titanium and titanium dioxide what 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.090
 what it does is a rebound in the class of the 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.040
 camera what does this mean not what 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.580
 you can use yes of course you can not use for 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.619
 course but not to take pictures 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.440
 because it will make them all this area 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.710
 get whiter than it is and also 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.900
 the one that is so heavy so creamy in 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.400
 not so creamy reality so heavy 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.310
 it brings together the lines of 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.250
 expression now yes I buy it and I have it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.180
 to throw not absolutely not what 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.730
 they can do if they already bought it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.030
 if they are going to use it to irrigate to cover 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.330
 the dark circles is to take a little cream 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.700
 moisturizer and dilute it or make it a 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.760
 little lighter with the moisturizer 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.740
 That helps a lot and what they 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320
 I recommend not to throw it away the corrector is 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.119
 I love it, it's divine, it serves 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.360
 very much super cognitive about everything 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.100
 for those who have those dark circles 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.320
 grayish browns 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.319
 this barbarian comes obviously they are going to 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.680
 have to buy in the mwv tone because 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.250
 it is more salmon ado more throwing the pink 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.030
 elena w into the sea is more yellowish 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.120
 that of w is more pink they to him in it 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.110
 they call the kun a lot that is neutral 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 cold and the nw is not cholguÃ¡n that is 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.690
 neutral quality so this is the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.510
 first I recommend them for what 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.180
 they are sunspots age spots 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.480
 for what are granites my 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.550
 recommendation is not to use it in dark circles 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.250
 then we went to the pse I show them to fit 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.250
 This comes in a tube is more liquid 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.210
 It is not so heavy 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.870
 very cultivation 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.750
 is a shelf has a satin finish 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.090
 this is the tone in the w 35 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.270
 is cultivation the truth is that it is good 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.940
 if they have many expression visits 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.330
 I do not recommend under the eyes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.069
 because if the same expression comes together 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.290
 but 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.930
 for someone who does not have many notes 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.079
 of expression is what you can use 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.319
 perfectly does not have solar protection 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.780
 so you can use it for photos and what 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.049
 that has this corrector is that of 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.599
 according to what they have to cover they go to 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.719
 go putting layer on layer and so they go 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.599
 to go working and will be working 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.969
 the intensity of coverage after 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.510
 we have this that is the select charge 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.409
 this is in the tone at double 15 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.120
 I usually buy the darker shade 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.430
 the lighter tone for later 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.719
 mix them this what you have is that is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.719
 super super liquid the previous one the 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.910
 select sample cover are not liquid 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.190
 more creamy 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.420
 has as more texture is that it is not 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.890
 super liquid 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.890
 it does not cover so much 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.130
 they see that it is not very healing 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.690
 but for those who have many 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.100
 lines of expression and do not have to 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.410
 cover a lot is great because it is not 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.930
 with a liquid base so it does not have 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.680
 a lot of texture that's the good thing about this 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.229
 corrector does not have sunscreen either 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.949
 it's liquid the other the select showed 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.840
 cover is more more moisturizing this is not 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.000
 directly it is more it seems as if 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.949
 had disappeared on my skin this is 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.860
 I recommend it to stop since it has 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:49.850
 many lines of expression and you need 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.250
 a medium to low coverage after 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.710
 we have the prolong has in this 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.880
 glass container 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.140
 but I have to tell you the truth 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.210
 I hate this container there is no product I hate the 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.080
 container and I think that's the first thing I hate 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.060
 of marc but because I hate him for this 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.820
 for me a proofreader is a product the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.410
 which I do not use much but at the same time 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.510
 little because they are corrected 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.660
 imperfections that are girls in the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.900
 face this makes me paralyze them 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.930
 lots of water products and when 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.280
 I squeeze and an animal goes to a lot of 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.370
 product and the truth is that it makes me 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.480
 waste product so that's a 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.830
 against to love and it is not a pro and I have 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.139
 have to say that if they can change the 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.110
 container 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.870
 I will be much much happier this 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.449
 corrector what you have is your appetizer 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.099
 more says it lasts 15 hours 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.870
 I did not try it yet so a lot 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.689
 I can tell you how good I can be 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.129
 to say is what I tasted in my hand I 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.620
 I recently bought the truth that I ask 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.800
 apologies but hey this does not not 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.569
 I can say a lot of super positive and dry 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.090
 mate 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.060
 now that yes 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.490
 I'm like trying to get it out and I do not know 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.520
 it goes so if what I did more 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.639
 it is surely to compare in texture with 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.530
 the final conciliar study that is this 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.740
 but because for being creamy and 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.560
 principle one is what they apply this is already 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.990
 creamier is totally matte and stays 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.210
 there as an ink like I have them 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.039
 who decide not to leave but good in 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.639
 texture at the beginning looks like this 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.370
 creamy except that it does not dry and this one 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.009
 when we apply it, it is satin and 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.889
 this one dries up and is totally mother 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.169
 then we have the mineral to this one is 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.599
 this man and how it gets dirty look like 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.060
 it's terrible how it gets dirty like we are 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.190
 they use the matte packaging but good what 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.259
 I'm just seeing the good monkey the 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.659
 mineral is what it has are minerals is 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.810
 very important for the skin and has a 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.540
 texture 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.520
 we believe a little lighter is a 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.250
 slightly lighter the texture than the 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:09.470
 monster cover but in what it does 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.360
 coverage is not so curitiba is not a 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.490
 little lighter so this one he 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.950
 I recommend for people who do not have 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.280
 much generates what is it or what 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.030
 have if they have fine lines 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.100
 this barbarian because it does not come together in 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.750
 this in the lines of expression I 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.770
 I'm wearing today and the truth is that 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.450
 love it so that's my review is my 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.130
 opinion about mac correctors 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.160
 I hope you serve them I hope you have 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.080
 liked if you have any questions write me 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.300
 many have written to me about the 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.990
 Sea bases are not'm an expert on mac 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.440
 I never worked for them just love their 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.170
 products 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.480
 I really like the truth that I am 

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.400
 fanatic of sea and that's why I make noise 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.320
 because I use all of the line and the truth 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.780
 that I have almost almost everything but that 

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.250
 are missing a couple of things so I hope 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.640
 that you liked delineated in the 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.640
 next 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.250
 ah
