 But what I suddenly do this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 I was sleeping like this . I was in a garage like this, but suddenly outside the door . 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.830
 Bharuqqaaaq 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 It sounds like this is the only way to hear this.

 Now I do not, I life groups here but I'm fine, I only biggest 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.060
 Listening to the sound Becoming a real lie that the heart beats fast 9 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.050
 When I'm sleeping, I can hear a strange sound when it is dark, 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.790
 I ran really fast but I do not know why this is so 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.920
 Just the sound of a heart breaking if you have something real quick yet awakened what 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.210
 I swell to the heart. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 It seems to be an elevator that stops even before you hear the sound of walking in a bruising north 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.490
 I heart suddenly caught quickly but this time I really just popping sound bombs 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 Fully significantly me I'm a popping sound. But the moment my sister this time only 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.420
 I was out in the open. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 But I was thinking something, and my brother was buying something . 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 Is it my brother's accident or a bomb? 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.440
 I thought it was an earthquake. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.340
 But the real thing is that I have a heart that jumps so fast and I feel like a real earthquake 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.130
 I heard it because it feels like shaking something in my heart faster 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.960
 I felt something shaking with more. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 I think so. So I put it on the outside. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 It looks out the window. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.489
 But only to show outside the show I do not do anything 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.910
 Then the only thing left is the bomb and my brother, so there are only two . 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.570
 I saw that, but once the car is standing on her guitar, it's okay. 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.989
 Yeah, and I wonder if my brother is worried , 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 I'm ready to go out and tell my mom . 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.709
 It looks like a bomb exploded or a car accident now. 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.600
 Brother academic ahninyago hangeo be in trouble earlier this brother went out and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.920
 Elevator nawatji 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.890
 This is where the elevator door is closed and the elevator is celebrated in the house like this 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.490
 It 's an elevator right here. 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.850
 So this is the 4th door . 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.270
 So we stopped in at 6:00 the sound of people talking in the elevator body 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.630
 I can hear what you hear, people on the sixth floor 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.630
 I did not catch it and it was so perfect, but as soon as I opened the elevator, 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.860

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:47.930
 Just as soon as the elevator opened on the fifth floor is another sort of a joint in my home language and

 But naneu my brother is thinking to promote hair fool like that should have no idea 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.849
 There could be an accident. 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.209
 I was worried that I could use it . 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:10.099
 Suddenly I do not believe in you. Hi . I 'm doing this. 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:14.780
 I do not think there is anything that I go in my head, I do not want the district-free

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.940
 And then I went to the top. 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:28.440
 Now I'm trying to match haebwatneunde after the accident place on the first floor but I do 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:34.460

 No, I moved to a mixed greeting to the head, not even the bully 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.970
 Until you tilt your head 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:52.319
 So once he apologized, he went out, but he had two kids 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:56.400
 Look at figuring to visit and to visit the accident after the accident gonna look out 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:58.919
 So I just went out and just bought something in the truck. 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.080
 Trucks are really into your truck. 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:08.400
 If you switch your brother really went out later that the real conversion every few seconds long 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.830
 I do not get a phone call, so I thought I was a real witch. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.479
 What is really great full line okay 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.870
 I do not really get a call like this. So I finally got a call. 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.770
 When I came before you'll receive 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.610
 But I just went to the place of the accident , and there's a truck full of big trucks. 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.840
 This chuck is just here and there are enemies out there that are breaking something . 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.630
 There are a lot of enemies that have something in common. 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.620
 The fragile traces are delicious 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.760
 But before the brother reported haebwado friend called me here is not that the other side of the jig 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.660

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.160
 I was worried about this car, but I think it was an accident. 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:50.660
 Look at something and then gone alone, really alone in thinking that I'm a strange sound 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.920
 So last car is going to see something and then something explodes in the car. 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.380
 That sounds like it. 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:01.700
