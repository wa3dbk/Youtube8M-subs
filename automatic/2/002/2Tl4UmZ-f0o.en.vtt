going<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.380> use<00:00:36.560> that<00:00:36.920> strand<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.610> measure<00:00:37.820> out

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
going to use that strand to measure out

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.690 
going to use that strand to measure out
three<00:00:38.540> other<00:00:38.780> pieces<00:00:39.320> then<00:00:40.280> I'm<00:00:40.430> going<00:00:40.640> to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
three other pieces then I'm going to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.240

vital<00:00:41.030> pieces<00:00:41.270> into<00:00:41.630> two<00:00:41.840> parts<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.590> I'm

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
vital pieces into two parts and I'm

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
vital pieces into two parts and I'm
going<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.789> fold<00:00:44.120> them<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:44.570> link<00:00:44.929> them

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
going to fold them and link them

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.209

together<00:00:45.379> like<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.859> little<00:00:45.980> chain<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.920> now<00:00:52.100> I'm

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
together like a little chain so now I'm

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.889 
together like a little chain so now I'm
going<00:00:52.339> to<00:00:52.429> take<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.879> little<00:00:53.120> yarn<00:00:53.359> extension

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
going to take the little yarn extension

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.959 
going to take the little yarn extension
that<00:00:54.019> I<00:00:54.079> made<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.649> braid<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.129> into<00:00:55.280> my<00:00:55.550> actual

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
that I made and braid it into my actual

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:18.740 
that I made and braid it into my actual
hair

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230 

once<00:01:19.410> I<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.620> it<00:01:19.860> attached<00:01:20.220> securely<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:21.060> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
once I get it attached securely I'm just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
once I get it attached securely I'm just
going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.480> take<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> couple<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> strands<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to take a couple of strands and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.220 
going to take a couple of strands and
put<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> side<00:01:23.850> where<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.090> hair<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.480> so

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
put it on the side where my hair is so

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:46.999 
put it on the side where my hair is so
that<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.590> becomes<00:01:25.890> easier<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> braid

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.620 

after<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.040> get<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.280> couple<00:01:48.549> inches<00:01:48.790> down<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.390> am

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
after I get a couple inches down I am

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
after I get a couple inches down I am
going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> attach<00:01:50.259> some<00:01:50.530> more<00:01:50.710> yarn<00:01:50.979> just

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
going to attach some more yarn just

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.279 
going to attach some more yarn just
because<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.000> want<00:01:52.210> my<00:01:52.270> locs<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.869> on<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> sick

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
because I want my locs to be on the sick

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.950 
because I want my locs to be on the sick
side<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.799> never<00:01:54.490> attach<00:01:54.880> all<00:01:55.119> my<00:01:55.329> yarn<00:01:55.570> at<00:01:55.750> once

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
side I never attach all my yarn at once

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.749 
side I never attach all my yarn at once
especially<00:01:56.350> when<00:01:56.740> I'm<00:01:56.860> going<00:01:57.159> for<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.430> thicker

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
especially when I'm going for a thicker

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.789 
especially when I'm going for a thicker
look<00:01:58.090> because<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.930> could<00:01:59.080> look<00:01:59.200> pretty<00:01:59.409> bulky

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
look because it could look pretty bulky

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.219 
look because it could look pretty bulky
up<00:02:00.369> top

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
up top

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.690 
up top
after<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.259> get<00:02:02.350> about<00:02:02.649> three<00:02:02.920> inches<00:02:03.220> down<00:02:03.429> I

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
after I get about three inches down I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.639 
after I get about three inches down I
always<00:02:04.090> stop<00:02:04.509> braiding<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.049> don't<00:02:05.259> understand

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
always stop braiding I don't understand

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.169 
always stop braiding I don't understand
why<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.799> lot<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.070> people<00:02:06.189> braid<00:02:06.640> all<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.030> way<00:02:07.119> to

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
why a lot of people braid all the way to

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.880 
why a lot of people braid all the way to
the<00:02:07.420> end<00:02:07.600> before<00:02:07.899> they<00:02:08.200> start<00:02:08.440> wrapping<00:02:08.709> their

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
the end before they start wrapping their

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.400 
the end before they start wrapping their
hair<00:02:09.039> that's<00:02:09.849> a<00:02:09.970> complete<00:02:10.330> time<00:02:10.539> waster<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.050> me

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
hair that's a complete time waster to me

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.530 
hair that's a complete time waster to me
so<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.010> begin<00:02:12.400> wrapping<00:02:12.940> I'm<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.480> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
so to begin wrapping I'm just going to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.220 
so to begin wrapping I'm just going to
take<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:14.049> strand<00:02:14.470> fold<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.459> half<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:16.150> just

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
take one strand fold it in half and just

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.960 
take one strand fold it in half and just
attach<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.560> hair<00:02:17.950> making<00:02:18.250> sure<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
attach it to my hair making sure to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.910 
attach it to my hair making sure to
cover<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.780> loop<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.230> made<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.709> that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
cover the loop that I made with that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:59.780 
cover the loop that I made with that
strand<00:02:21.220> along<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.700> way

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.119 

after<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.840> run<00:03:01.019> out<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.319> first<00:03:01.560> man<00:03:01.830> just

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
after you run out of the first man just

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.039 
after you run out of the first man just
going<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> take<00:03:02.519> another<00:03:02.819> loop<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.480> put<00:03:03.959> it

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
going to take another loop and put it

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.110 
going to take another loop and put it
just<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> little<00:03:04.470> bit<00:03:04.769> above<00:03:05.280> where<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.700> ended

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
just a little bit above where it ended

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.509 
just a little bit above where it ended
so<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.659> begin<00:03:06.900> wrapping<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.890> securely

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
so you can begin wrapping it securely

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.490 
so you can begin wrapping it securely
don't<00:03:09.120> worry<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.569> not<00:03:09.599> have<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.019> use<00:03:10.200> one

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
don't worry you do not have to use one

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110 
don't worry you do not have to use one
strand<00:03:10.860> at<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.489> wrap<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.819> hair<00:03:12.000> I'm

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
strand at a time to wrap the hair I'm

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:23.300 
strand at a time to wrap the hair I'm
just<00:03:12.360> showing<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.780> how<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.349> attach<00:03:14.040> it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.480 

you

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.910 

okay<00:03:26.150> once<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.480> get<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.870> level<00:03:27.200> that's<00:03:27.620> when<00:03:27.890> I

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
okay once I get to a level that's when I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.160 
okay once I get to a level that's when I
begin<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.640> wrap<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.120> with<00:03:29.270> multiple<00:03:29.780> strands

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
begin to wrap it with multiple strands

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.020 
begin to wrap it with multiple strands
and<00:03:30.290> this<00:03:30.560> definitely<00:03:31.040> helps<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.520> process<00:03:31.700> go

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and this definitely helps the process go

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.360 
and this definitely helps the process go
a<00:03:32.060> lot<00:03:32.330> faster<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.620> I'm<00:03:33.740> doing<00:03:34.100> I'm<00:03:34.220> not

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
a lot faster so what I'm doing I'm not

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.100 
a lot faster so what I'm doing I'm not
even<00:03:34.580> worrying<00:03:34.850> about<00:03:35.030> folding<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.960> in<00:03:36.080> half

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
even worrying about folding it in half

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.290 
even worrying about folding it in half
I'm<00:03:36.830> just<00:03:37.010> going<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.190> attach<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.850> like<00:03:38.000> four

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
I'm just going to attach about like four

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.150 
I'm just going to attach about like four
or<00:03:38.390> five<00:03:38.420> strands<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.530> attach<00:03:39.800> six

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
or five strands you can attach six

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.280 
or five strands you can attach six
strands<00:03:40.700> eight<00:03:40.880> strands<00:03:41.450> nine<00:03:41.870> strands

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
strands eight strands nine strands

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.100 
strands eight strands nine strands
whatever<00:03:43.250> but<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.940> higher<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.480> number<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
whatever but the higher the number the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.740 
whatever but the higher the number the
faster<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.920> process<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.400> go<00:03:46.520> the<00:03:47.480> only

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
faster that the process will go the only

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.480 
faster that the process will go the only
thing<00:03:47.900> about<00:03:48.020> using<00:03:48.380> multiple<00:03:49.040> strands<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
thing about using multiple strands is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.010 
thing about using multiple strands is
that<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.000> be<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.600> really<00:03:50.720> neat

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
that you have to be really really neat

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.930 
that you have to be really really neat
with<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:51.800> sake<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.160> tutorial<00:03:52.220> I

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
with it for the sake of this tutorial I

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.970 
with it for the sake of this tutorial I
wanted<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.300> go<00:03:53.480> slowly<00:03:53.990> so<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.350> guys<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:54.800> see

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
wanted to go slowly so you guys can see

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.540 
wanted to go slowly so you guys can see
how<00:03:55.220> its<00:03:55.580> lining<00:03:55.880> up<00:03:56.180> but<00:03:56.960> just<00:03:57.140> make<00:03:57.410> sure

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
how its lining up but just make sure

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.460 
how its lining up but just make sure
you're<00:03:58.550> lining<00:03:58.940> one<00:03:59.180> up<00:03:59.450> after<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.990> other<00:04:00.170> and

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
you're lining one up after the other and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.770 
you're lining one up after the other and
tightening<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.210> don't<00:04:02.390> have<00:04:02.540> any

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
tightening it so that you don't have any

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.190 
tightening it so that you don't have any
you<00:04:03.320> know<00:04:03.350> loose<00:04:03.920> bumps<00:04:04.550> or<00:04:04.790> curves<00:04:05.480> or<00:04:05.930> gaps

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
you know loose bumps or curves or gaps

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.600 
you know loose bumps or curves or gaps
or<00:04:06.530> anything<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:06.980> want<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.490> as

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
or anything you want it to be as

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.420 
or anything you want it to be as
seamless<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.150> possible<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:15.310> once<00:04:16.310> you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
seamless as possible and once you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.770 
seamless as possible and once you
approach<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.970> end<00:04:17.150> you're<00:04:17.360> just<00:04:17.510> going<00:04:17.690> to

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
approach the end you're just going to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.750 
approach the end you're just going to
braid<00:04:18.020> it<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.350> little<00:04:18.680> bit<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.070> then<00:04:19.340> tie<00:04:19.700> it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
braid it a little bit and then tie it

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:45.230 
braid it a little bit and then tie it
into<00:04:19.940> that

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.969 

after<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.139> you're<00:04:46.289> just<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.680> cut<00:04:46.889> off

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
after that you're just going to cut off

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.770 
after that you're just going to cut off
the<00:04:47.130> excess<00:04:47.430> pieces<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.389> burn

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the excess pieces and then burn

00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:12.840 
the excess pieces and then burn
whatever's<00:04:49.319> left

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.540 

so<00:05:13.840> in<00:05:13.990> order<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.380> create<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.860> multicolored

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
so in order to create the multicolored

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.920 
so in order to create the multicolored
lock<00:05:15.760> you're<00:05:16.030> basically<00:05:16.450> going<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.720> follow

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
lock you're basically going to follow

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.870 
lock you're basically going to follow
the<00:05:17.170> same<00:05:17.470> exact<00:05:17.950> steps<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.550> showed<00:05:18.760> you

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the same exact steps that I showed you

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.730 
the same exact steps that I showed you
all<00:05:19.030> before<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.600> just<00:05:20.080> started<00:05:20.350> wrapping<00:05:20.620> with

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
all before I just started wrapping with

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.680 
all before I just started wrapping with
you<00:05:20.830> till<00:05:21.070> yarn<00:05:21.280> first<00:05:21.550> then<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:22.030> use<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.210> small

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
you till yarn first then I use a small

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.510 
you till yarn first then I use a small
strip<00:05:23.110> of<00:05:23.140> Kinte<00:05:23.620> fabric<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.190> wrap<00:05:24.370> that

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
strip of Kinte fabric and wrap that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.700 
strip of Kinte fabric and wrap that
around<00:05:24.580> as<00:05:25.030> if<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.390> was<00:05:25.510> yarn<00:05:25.780> then<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.560> went

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
around as if it was yarn then I went

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.890 
around as if it was yarn then I went
around<00:05:26.830> with<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.280> neon<00:05:27.550> yarn<00:05:28.000> then<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.570> teal

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
around with the neon yarn then the teal

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.740 
around with the neon yarn then the teal
and<00:05:29.230> then<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.160> kimchi<00:05:30.550> yarn<00:05:30.790> again<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.450> then

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
and then the kimchi yarn again and then

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.780 
and then the kimchi yarn again and then
the<00:05:31.840> tail<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:32.200> then<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.440> neon<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:33.100> then<00:05:33.700> I

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
the tail and then the neon and then I

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.370 
the tail and then the neon and then I
just<00:05:34.000> burnt<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:34.270> at<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.480> end<00:05:34.660> if<00:05:34.840> you<00:05:35.140> still

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
just burnt it at the end if you still

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.200 
just burnt it at the end if you still
want<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.590> step-by-step<00:05:36.190> tutorial<00:05:36.820> for<00:05:37.120> the
