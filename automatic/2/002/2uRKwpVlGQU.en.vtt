around<00:01:40.340> add<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:45.649> one

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
around add it again and you can see one

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:56.840 
around add it again and you can see one
more<00:01:46.829> time<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.549> we'll<00:01:53.850> add<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:55.850> then

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
more time and we'll add it and then

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.719 
more time and we'll add it and then
we'll<00:01:57.030> come<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.360> front<00:02:00.719> view<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:04.729> an

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
we'll come to the front view or an

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.310 
we'll come to the front view or an
angled<00:02:06.119> view<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.329> guess<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> try<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.040 

maybe<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.440> front<00:02:14.770> no<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.340> angle<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.000> good<00:02:16.240> so

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
maybe a front no the angle do is good so

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.500 
maybe a front no the angle do is good so
we'll<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.970> we'll<00:02:21.210> add<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.240> little

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
we'll do that and we'll add a little

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.460 
we'll do that and we'll add a little
blood<00:02:22.870> splatter<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> camera<00:02:28.170> down<00:02:29.170> over

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
blood splatter to the camera down over

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.750 
blood splatter to the camera down over
here<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.860> little<00:02:30.190> bigger<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:33.070> add<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
here a little bigger and add that and I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.630 
here a little bigger and add that and I
think<00:02:36.760> that's<00:02:37.060> pretty<00:02:37.270> good<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.460> want

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
think that's pretty good so if you want

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.090 
think that's pretty good so if you want
to<00:02:39.700> remove<00:02:40.450> all<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.080> those<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> timeline

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
to remove all of those from the timeline

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.530 
to remove all of those from the timeline
you<00:02:42.220> hit<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> little<00:02:42.610> gun<00:02:42.850> with<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.120> red<00:02:43.300> X

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
you hit the little gun with the red X

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.780 
you hit the little gun with the red X
the<00:02:44.110> red<00:02:44.290> slash<00:02:44.709> through<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.640> will

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
the red slash through it and that will

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.820 
the red slash through it and that will
remove<00:02:46.150> all<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.630> them<00:02:46.780> maybe<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.680> made<00:02:47.800> a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
remove all of them maybe if you made a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.470 
remove all of them maybe if you made a
mistake<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:48.340> something<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:49.270> we're<00:02:49.390> gonna

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
mistake or something but we're gonna

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.010 
mistake or something but we're gonna
click<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.810> red<00:02:50.320> checkmark<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:52.540> build<00:02:52.870> our

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020

was just a really basic view on it you
can<00:03:28.150> obviously<00:03:28.239> spent<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.140> lot<00:03:29.320> more<00:03:29.350> time<00:03:29.530> on

can obviously spent a lot more time on
it<00:03:29.980> use<00:03:30.220> different<00:03:30.640> effects<00:03:30.970> use<00:03:31.390> different

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it use different effects use different

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.120 
it use different effects use different
overlays<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.989> make<00:03:35.380> it<00:03:35.500> look<00:03:35.620> more<00:03:35.769> realistic
