00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.570
 My name is Alan Cairo. 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.390
 I have been skateboarding for many years. 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.379
 Today I am going to teach you how to do a hard flip. 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.179
 You can find a place with small seams to practice. 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.139
 I am going to demonstrate the footsteps of this move. 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.100
 Note that my forefoot is almost parallel to the body. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 Almost straight on the board 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.330
 My back foot is stepping on the end of the board, but some slopes are stepping on the edge of the board. 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.760
 Your foot will be key in this move 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.590
 Next, I saw my feet, my forefoot support points are somewhat curved. 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 I also put the back foot on the edge of the board 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790
 Because your back foot will be going to shovel the board 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.660
 And your forefoot is like the picture 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210
 Will brush the board outward to form a flap 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 This action may not be very accustomed to you. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.680
 Because your forefoot will leave the board in the middle of the board. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.079
 So that you can make the right flip 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.860
 This is how the board flips in the air. 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.190
 You should have landed on the board before landing. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.559
 Here are some ways you can start practicing 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 Just practicing how to properly flip the board will be a good start. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.799
 Your hind feet are off the board and your fore feet are kept on the board and behind the board. 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.270
 Before you really start doing all the moves in one go 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.060
 It would be more appropriate and helpful to practice the correct flipping of the board first. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.619
 All you have to do is to get familiar with the action. 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.670
 This difficult place 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.469
 That is the action you have to do on the front foot (you have to brush off the board in the middle of the board) 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.509
 That's why I have to put my forefoot straight. 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170
 Because of this, I can quickly flip the board with my toes. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.549
 But on the other hand, I can let my feet leave quickly before the flaps to make the board flip. 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.189
 To reach my forefoot in the middle of the board when leaving and flipping 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.950
 And your hind foot will be the action of shoveling the board 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.229
 Your board will be a little forward 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.020
 Your forefoot movements will have some similarities to the toe flaps. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749
 But the difference is that your forefoot is to stay straight 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.529
 As I said before, your feet are going to leave the board in the middle of the board. 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:52.959
 So the board will flip over easily 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.819
 Because of the position of the board produced by your hind legs 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.219
 Will be the same as your forefoot toe 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.359
 This is another positive photographic lens 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.789
 When you bounce or when your hind legs leave the board 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.119
 You can try to practice the timing 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.209
 When you bounce off the board, you will have to go to the board with your feet. 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.599
 And these actions are done in the air 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.819
 After landing with both feet 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.650
 I know that you will learn, as long as you practice more. 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.629
 Don't give up, I believe what you have done 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.489
 If you haven't gotten 100% cooked toes, flips or turn 180 degrees 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.769
 Or other basic tricks 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.569
 I highly recommend that you go to see the skateboard. 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.180
 I spent a lot of energy on these videos for a total length of about 50 minutes. 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.069
 I know what you will like. 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.790
 If you want to see the hardflip parsing movie in slow motion 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.569
 You can click on the link above. 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.129
 Itâ€™s also helpful to see the slow-motion version. 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.920
 So you can see the footsteps and changes 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.370
 There are other videos in the playlist 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.849
 I want to thank you very much for reading my video. 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.810
 Thank you very much for your support. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.489
 You are the best!
