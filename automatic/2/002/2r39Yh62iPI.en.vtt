well Jake I've never seen this before
what's<00:00:08.880> going<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.269> oh<00:00:09.540> yes<00:00:10.820> she's<00:00:11.820> been<00:00:12.000> packed

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
what's going on oh yes she's been packed

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.630 
what's going on oh yes she's been packed
in<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> past<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.490> she<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.670> hiding<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.690> her

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
in the past and she was hiding and her

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.269 
in the past and she was hiding and her
event<00:00:17.640> which<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.210> her<00:00:18.390> bomb<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:20.010> was

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
event which is her bomb was it was

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.080 
event which is her bomb was it was
covered<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.789> runny<00:00:21.720> stool<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:23.850> blood

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
covered in runny stool and some blood

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.720 
covered in runny stool and some blood
too<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.869> I've<00:00:25.500> separated<00:00:25.800> her<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.519> think

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
too so I've separated her and I think

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
too so I've separated her and I think
the<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.029> step<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.420> treating<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> giving

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the first step in treating it is giving

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919 
the first step in treating it is giving
her<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.920> nice<00:00:29.369> bath<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:30.119> clean<00:00:30.359> everything<00:00:30.689> up

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
her a nice bath to clean everything up

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.100 
her a nice bath to clean everything up
and<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> makes<00:00:31.619> her<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.980> relaxed<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.700> well

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
and it makes her like relaxed as well

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.420 
and it makes her like relaxed as well
I'm<00:00:34.110> surprised<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> chicken<00:00:35.309> would

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I'm surprised that the chicken would

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.280 
I'm surprised that the chicken would
take<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> bath<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.710> calmly<00:00:38.780> was<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.899> actually

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
take a bath so calmly was this actually

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.680 
take a bath so calmly was this actually
like<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
like it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.090 
like it
apparently<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.750> mean<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> had<00:00:43.260> he<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.950> don't

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
apparently I mean you had he you don't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
apparently I mean you had he you don't
even<00:00:44.190> necessarily<00:00:44.340> need<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.090> hold<00:00:45.300> her<00:00:45.420> there

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
even necessarily need to hold her there

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
even necessarily need to hold her there
right<00:00:48.170> Wow<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.739> somehow<00:00:49.980> thought<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
right Wow I just somehow thought that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.750 
right Wow I just somehow thought that
you<00:00:50.610> wouldn't<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> she<00:00:53.489> was

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you wouldn't like this but so she was

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
you wouldn't like this but so she was
pretty<00:00:53.960> encrusted<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> behind<00:00:55.860> end<00:01:00.350> can

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
pretty encrusted on the behind end can

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
pretty encrusted on the behind end can
we<00:01:01.469> take<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.129> whether<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.399> too

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
we take a look or whether that be too

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
we take a look or whether that be too
distressing<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.480> her<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.110> might<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
distressing for her that might be a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.060 
distressing for her that might be a
little<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> you've<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.010> a

little bit above freezing

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
little bit above freezing
yes<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> gonna<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> drying<00:01:30.450> her

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
off cause you can't put about noting

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.550 
off cause you can't put about noting
here<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> while<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.299> had<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.140> idea

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.350 

setting<00:01:40.560> he<00:01:40.799> guns<00:01:41.040> pretty<00:01:41.460> hot<00:01:41.700> even<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> low

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
setting he guns pretty hot even on a low

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.160 
setting he guns pretty hot even on a low
setting<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> noises<00:01:43.799> scare<00:01:44.100> her<00:01:44.250> too<00:01:45.170> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
setting and the noises scare her too I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.660 
setting and the noises scare her too I
think<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> should<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.369> put<00:01:47.549> her<00:01:47.640> in

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
think you should just just put her in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
think you should just just put her in
overnight<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.450> crates<00:01:48.750> over<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.200> one

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
overnight in these crates over here one

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
overnight in these crates over here one
on<00:01:49.380> top<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> other<00:01:50.270> yeah<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> don't<00:01:51.570> know

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
dry naturally we just see how clean

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.360

she's<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.829> here

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.880 

that<00:02:01.370> needs<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.790> all<00:02:02.000> encrusted<00:02:02.540> oh<00:02:03.080> yeah

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
that needs to be all encrusted oh yeah

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.310 
that needs to be all encrusted oh yeah
that<00:02:04.070> looks<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.370> lot<00:02:04.490> better<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:05.990> she's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
that looks a lot better you think she's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.300 
that looks a lot better you think she's
so<00:02:06.980> he<00:02:07.580> said<00:02:07.790> she<00:02:07.940> was<00:02:08.090> bleeding<00:02:08.800> I'm<00:02:09.800> not<00:02:09.979> sure

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
so he said she was bleeding I'm not sure

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.270 
so he said she was bleeding I'm not sure
I<00:02:11.320> didn't<00:02:12.320> you<00:02:12.380> mention<00:02:12.530> something<00:02:12.710> about<00:02:13.040> her

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
I didn't you mention something about her

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.980 
I didn't you mention something about her
being<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.610> young<00:02:13.820> hand<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.270> maybe<00:02:14.420> starting<00:02:14.900> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
being a young hand and maybe starting to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.320 
being a young hand and maybe starting to
lay<00:02:15.140> sooner<00:02:15.860> than<00:02:16.010> she<00:02:16.040> forgot<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.850> breathe<00:02:17.120> I

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
lay sooner than she forgot to breathe I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.760 
lay sooner than she forgot to breathe I
think<00:02:17.570> she<00:02:17.660> might<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:17.870> started<00:02:18.230> lying<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.590> bit

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
think she might have started lying a bit

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.510 
think she might have started lying a bit
