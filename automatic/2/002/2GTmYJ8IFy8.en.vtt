it grunts no special moves that uses

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.100 
it grunts no special moves that uses
your<00:03:01.350> photos<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.739> also<00:03:04.860> do<00:03:06.110> special

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
your photos and you can also do special

your photos and you can also do special
moves<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.350> these<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:12.140> it's<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:13.260> depending

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
moves like these so it's all depending

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.770 
moves like these so it's all depending
on<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.580> standard<00:03:18.030> fight<00:03:18.239> there<00:03:18.660> is

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.400 
and I'll choose the single-player mode
which<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:29.640> like<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> 1<00:03:30.180> vs.<00:03:30.630> 100<00:03:30.870> type

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
which is just like a 1 vs. 100 type

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.060 
which is just like a 1 vs. 100 type
thing<00:03:33.650> take<00:03:34.650> myself<00:03:35.209> pick<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.360> stage

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.229 

actually<00:03:41.070> what<00:03:41.220> I'll<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.549> I'll<00:03:41.700> just

off it's great actually pretty good

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.170 
off it's great actually pretty good
music<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.950> not<00:03:59.070> too<00:03:59.250> many<00:03:59.400> tracks<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.000> it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
music it's not too many tracks but it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.720 
music it's not too many tracks but it
works<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:01.410> only<00:04:01.590> bun<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:01.950> bottom<00:04:02.519> screen

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
works the only bun on the bottom screen

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.080 
works the only bun on the bottom screen
is<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.269> block<00:04:03.570> one<00:04:03.810> which<00:04:04.110> brings<00:04:04.530> up<00:04:05.090> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
is the block one which brings up the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.810 
is the block one which brings up the
master<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.739> just<00:04:07.950> basically<00:04:08.160> walk<00:04:08.549> along

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
master so you just basically walk along

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:22.110 
master so you just basically walk along
be<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.660> crap

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.560 

it's<00:04:23.120> not<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.510> pretty<00:04:23.750> easy<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.440> you<00:04:24.620> can<00:04:24.770> see

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it's not so pretty easy as you can see

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.270 
it's not so pretty easy as you can see
but<00:04:26.570> as<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.320> go<00:04:27.440> along<00:04:27.530> there<00:04:27.830> than<00:04:27.980> better

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
but as you go along there than better

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.840 
but as you go along there than better
moves<00:04:28.640> um<00:04:30.040> obviously<00:04:31.040> if<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.340> was<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.520> English

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
now who do my special move so the result

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.870 
now who do my special move so the result
everything<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.040> do<00:05:28.220> record<00:05:28.640> them<00:05:28.760> all

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
everything that you do record them all

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.860 
everything that you do record them all
so<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.060> know<00:05:29.300> what<00:05:29.840> they<00:05:29.990> are<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:32.510> does<00:05:32.660> take<00:05:32.840> a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
so you know what they are it does take a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.330 
so you know what they are it does take a
while<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.290> build<00:05:33.410> up<00:05:33.590> this<00:05:33.710> fissure<00:05:33.950> move<00:05:34.160> you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
while to build up this fissure move you

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.540 
while to build up this fissure move you
only<00:05:34.460> get<00:05:34.640> it<00:05:34.760> every<00:05:35.540> so<00:05:35.690> often<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:40.370> that's

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
only get it every so often and that's

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.110 
only get it every so often and that's
the<00:05:40.850> main<00:05:41.030> mate<00:05:42.020> that's<00:05:42.530> basically<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.490> whole

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
the main mate that's basically the whole

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.870 
the main mate that's basically the whole
that<00:05:44.419> mode<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.680> crater<00:05:46.100> but<00:05:46.370> that's

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
that mode and the crater but that's

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.210 
that mode and the crater but that's
about<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.470> there's<00:05:48.470> no<00:05:48.620> word<00:05:48.770> if<00:05:48.950> this<00:05:49.070> will

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
about it there's no word if this will

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.280 
about it there's no word if this will
come<00:05:49.370> outside<00:05:49.550> japan<00:05:50.150> yet<00:05:50.360> but<00:05:50.600> it<00:05:51.020> most

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
come outside japan yet but it most

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.650 
come outside japan yet but it most
likely<00:05:51.410> will<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:53.440> i<00:05:54.440> just<00:05:54.620> died<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:57.040> it's<00:05:58.040> uh

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
likely will and i just died and it's uh

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.050 
likely will and i just died and it's uh
your<00:05:59.660> fail<00:05:59.930> victory<00:06:00.700> picture<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:01.850> i<00:06:01.880> talked

earlier<00:06:02.650> fail<00:06:03.650> victory<00:06:04.960> 38<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.200> new<00:06:06.410> record

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
earlier fail victory 38 is a new record

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.900 
earlier fail victory 38 is a new record
because<00:06:06.950> it's<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.310> first<00:06:07.340> time<00:06:07.669> i<00:06:07.729> actually

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
because it's the first time i actually
