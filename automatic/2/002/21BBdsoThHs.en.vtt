00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
going to make that not happen anymore

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.120 
going to make that not happen anymore
okay<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.320> first<00:00:16.529> thing<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> won't<00:00:16.830> look<00:00:16.949> out

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
okay so first thing you won't look out

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.820 
okay so first thing you won't look out
for<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> opponent<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:18.990> stare<00:00:19.260> for

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
for is the opponent for stare for

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
for is the opponent for stare for
example<00:00:20.189> snake<00:00:20.430> crabs<00:00:20.640> Fox<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.270> his<00:00:22.170> feet<00:00:22.380> are

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
example snake crabs Fox and his feet are

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.009 
example snake crabs Fox and his feet are
off<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.590> ground<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.160> he<00:00:23.580> flies<00:00:23.910> up<00:00:24.060> now

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
off the ground and he flies up now

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.779 
off the ground and he flies up now

fought the scraps Nick his feet are on
the<00:00:26.849> ground<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.420> he's<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.439> though

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the ground and he's like that though

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.870 
the ground and he's like that though
notice<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.410> difference<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> second

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
notice the difference now the second

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
notice the difference now the second
thing<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.059> wanted<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> jump<00:00:33.899> input<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
thing you wanted to do is jump input so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
thing you wanted to do is jump input so
for<00:00:35.370> example<00:00:35.790> Fox<00:00:36.149> grab<00:00:36.420> snake<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.770> snake

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
for example Fox grab snake the snake

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.830 
for example Fox grab snake the snake
presses<00:00:38.399> jump<00:00:40.910> doesn't

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:57.279 

the<00:00:47.320> ship

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.840 

ergo<00:00:57.890> that's<00:00:58.250> what's<00:00:58.399> supposed<00:00:58.609> to<00:00:58.760> happen

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
ergo that's what's supposed to happen

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.670 
ergo that's what's supposed to happen
gets<00:00:59.690> air<00:01:00.230> release

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.540 

there<00:01:04.250> we<00:01:04.580> go<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.690> people<00:01:06.590> input<00:01:07.010> jump<00:01:07.250> it

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
there we go so people input jump it

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.690 
there we go so people input jump it
supersedes<00:01:08.360> if<00:01:08.690> he<00:01:08.930> gets<00:01:09.230> forced<00:01:09.980> air<00:01:10.220> or<00:01:10.250> not

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
supersedes if he gets forced air or not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.340 
supersedes if he gets forced air or not
he<00:01:10.880> just<00:01:10.910> automatically<00:01:11.480> gets<00:01:11.780> air<00:01:12.080> released

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
he just automatically gets air released

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.140 
he just automatically gets air released
the<00:01:12.980> third<00:01:13.010> thing<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.460> want<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.640> do<00:01:13.730> is<00:01:13.820> pummel

taxi<00:01:22.310> or<00:01:22.670> pampas<00:01:23.180> ground<00:01:23.900> release<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.470> don't

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
taxi or pampas ground release I don't

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.180 
taxi or pampas ground release I don't
know<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.460> exact<00:01:25.790> frame<00:01:26.060> data<00:01:26.380> but<00:01:27.850> if<00:01:28.870> you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
know the exact frame data but if you

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.270 
know the exact frame data but if you
pummel<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:32.020> there<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.380> for<00:01:33.710> however

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
pummel and there really is for however

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.580 
pummel and there really is for however
 many<00:01:35.450> frames<00:01:35.720> afterwards<00:01:36.350> they

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
 many frames afterwards they

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.710 
 many frames afterwards they
automatically<00:01:37.160> get<00:01:37.310> ground<00:01:37.580> release<00:01:37.850> pummel

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
automatically get ground release pummel

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.410 
automatically get ground release pummel
you<00:01:38.840> take<00:01:39.020> some<00:01:39.350> priority<00:01:39.800> over<00:01:39.979> everything

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
you take some priority over everything

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.200 
you take some priority over everything
so<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.600> example<00:01:41.930> Fox<00:01:42.170> gets<00:01:42.410> air<00:01:42.560> at<00:01:42.740> least<00:01:42.920> and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
so for example Fox gets air at least and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.450 
so for example Fox gets air at least and
I'm<00:01:44.210> inputting<00:01:44.420> jump<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.820> doesn't<00:01:47.090> matter

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
I'm inputting jump and it doesn't matter

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.340 
I'm inputting jump and it doesn't matter
he<00:01:49.460> still<00:01:49.700> gets<00:01:49.850> ground<00:01:50.090> at<00:01:50.240> least<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.930> that's

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
he still gets ground at least so that's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.920 
he still gets ground at least so that's
really<00:01:51.619> all<00:01:51.860> there<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.490> they're<00:01:52.670> only

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
really all there is to it they're only

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.150 
really all there is to it they're only
those<00:01:53.930> three<00:01:54.110> things<00:01:54.320> if<00:01:54.619> they<00:01:54.710> get<00:01:54.860> forced

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
those three things if they get forced

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.550 
those three things if they get forced
there<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:56.600> want<00:01:56.750> put<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.900> jump<00:01:57.170> or<00:01:57.320> if<00:01:57.470> you

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
there if you want put a jump or if you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.080 
there if you want put a jump or if you
pummel<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> end<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.790> this<00:01:58.940> bye<00:01:59.930> bye
