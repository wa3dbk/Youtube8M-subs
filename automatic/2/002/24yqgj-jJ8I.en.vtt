00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.110
 Welcome to servus today 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.490
 a new video today not on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 from german top gameplays 2 from the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 backup channel of german top gameplays 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 Today , in the background are a dsl 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 locklear on the maps studio of the asics 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.590
 he plays the idea he is with and bls 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 yes with a battery with the aqua camouflage is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 a cool meeting is very chic 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 Energies xp has been detected in the meantime 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.770
 Everyone is just a fierce player 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.149
 but if you do not know 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.370
 probably the type of grazer dom in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 his microphone is talking my name is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.469
 at home and I'm 17 years old and yes 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.739
 my channel is like the german top 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.469
 gameplays channels a pure cod channel 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.600
 So I only bring cod videos but yes 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.739
 also variety as well as on gameplays 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 channel was i find variety 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.309
 little horny so mw2 now and then a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.039
 just something else just like that and yes 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 that's what you mean to me 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 freis still bed is thank you to chris 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 that here the video may upload that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 you see that in the german language 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
 gameplays two channel because yes is not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.450
 is not normal that you just like that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
 commentator takes and that's why it falls 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 thank you here just for now my 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 team today I have a theme brought 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 but the gameplay is pretty short though 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.229
 yes I'm talking too much that it's short 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 that's less time again 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 no matter my topic today is gameplay 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
 player and I just think that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.640
 the gameplay player has become much too 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 Little is honored because I sometimes see 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 youtube videos I do not want any now 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.079
 I do not call names on flame 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.340
 or anything like that i just look 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.259
 some youtube videos so in the background 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 a cod gameplay is running and the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.610
 Commentator the eloquent of the goes even 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.439
 not on the gameplay one only says 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.299
 Also in the background, running cod see the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.250
 nuclear at the sea he says 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.840
 I think that's a shame because why brings 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 one then cod at all in the background 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.799
 I just ask myself why can you 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270
 then not background I do not know 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.549
 pokÃ©mon bring though nee that would be 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
 cool again that would be yes or why can 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.890
 you do not just set a background 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.649
 black picture or no idea 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 somehow grass is just normal grass 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.060
 Just run in the background like this 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 but of course you have to cod because that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.970
 of course, clicks and find that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 I'm sorry that some commentators even 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.540
 do not go into the gameplay that way 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 I find it really unfair that the gameplay 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.720
 sometimes play 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.210
 Not only is he just saying that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.580
 I've got the gameplay 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.610
 I honestly find gameplay players 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.680
 just have to pay much more attention 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.240
 get how they get now 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.400
 that's how they get right now because of me 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.780
 somehow find gameplays is playing 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.070
 it's really hard, I realize 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.940
 I'm honest, that's a little bit 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.180
 heavier than here 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.500
 to be a commentator and now he says 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 Maybe not a year everyone can 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.010
 speak fluently and that's right 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.260
 Of course, but you have to too 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.550
 say yes, at least the gameplay 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.890
 is worth the same 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.080
 commentator and therefore looks at the end 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.209
 6 left over because it really a violent 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.709
 type and yes if he has the gameplay 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.880
 If he has experience he pushed him over 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.620
 I agree with you already 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.660
 pass my note and look at 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 first german top gameplays channel 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.000
 over if you liked everything 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.260
 Let's thumb it there or 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.100
 Any criticism where I am with something 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.040
 can start 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.040
 in this sense I am raushaut ranking
