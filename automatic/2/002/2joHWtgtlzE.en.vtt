00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 frivolous even western analyst 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.500
 Moreover, the foreign press claims 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.910
 that the US sanctions against Russia shook 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 the authority of the states themselves and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.529
 demonstrated the weakness of the president 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 Obamaâ€™s huts were not scared and Russian 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.760
 blacklists officials got away 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.859

 shower, they finally realized the Crimea and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 Sevastopol is final and irrevocable 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.809
 Lost for Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.460
 to do what could not be expected from him 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 no, did not resign 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 Take higher spoke in Kiev Kyiv 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 the leader explained the relationship with Russia 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 spoils was not going at all and the fact that he 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 personally threatened to break them altogether 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 the dress came on anti-Russian zipper 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 rhetoric so who offended at such a thing I 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.629
 I will do my best to not just 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.840
 save the world but build with Russia 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 genuinely partner and neighborly 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.930
 relationship solely for the sake of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.060
 unity of Ukraine 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 the issue of entry into NATO is not worth 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.150
 however, the old rhetoric of the new 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 Ukrainian leadership spoke 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.630
 quite the opposite is why 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.189
 Russia considered the need to protect 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 Russian-speaking population of Crimea 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.680
 extended not only a brotherly hand 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.200
 Ukrainian people 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.160
 expressly stated that they will actively fight 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.320
 so that those Nazis who came to power 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.410
 those fascist order when forbid 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 language and drags nato at the turn of the Russian 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.380
 de radios saved us from future 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.910
 shocks there are richer started complicated 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.830
 the game here is the foreign minister france 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.510
 On the one hand, Russia announces that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.190
 the big eight will take place without 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.740
 representative of Moscow and immediately 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.390
 reminiscent of the way Mr Putin perfectly 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 waiting in France for the celebration of the anniversary 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.800
 Allied troops landing in Normandy 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.690
 German Chancellor for which Ukraine 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.340
 important market is tougher 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.200
 referent held in africa 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.880
 international law and in our 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.110
 the conviction of acceptance in Russian 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.970
 the federations were also like that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 international law, what happens 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.209
 now this is the return of the regions 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.950
 with a Russian speaking population in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.600
 international legal field consider 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.550
 Russian politicians wonder what 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.790
 the process causes such a reaction of countries 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.580
 created the president of Kosovo day March 18 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 can be equated to May 9, 45 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.600
 when we defeated the terrible enemy 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.470
 today russia 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.540
 and finally turned to face everyone 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.010
 green peoples leadership over as well 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.480
 stated that he considers joining Crimea 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.489
 illegal the same position 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.040
 adhere to the president of the council there and 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.110
 European Commission Herman Van Rompuy 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.120
 not that the European Union cannot recognize 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.190
 the inclusion of creams composition of Russia and here 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.750
 US Secretary of State probably does not mean 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.900
 recognized the need for any 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.670
 action by Russia inciting 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.010
 nationalist sentiment in Ukraine 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.690
 may lead to dangerous consequences 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.549
 with all due respect to the Russian word 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.269
 the president don't have a real collar 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.040
 of reality 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.930
 US Vice President Biden 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.820
 reporters waited for more will get here 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.920
 empty tribune on which the text lies 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.110
 performances but in advance prepared 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.840
 a little piece of paper is being carried away by an assistant 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 finally biden is laconic 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.890
 my background and the political 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.290
 economic isolation of Russia will increase 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.989
 if Moscow will continue to go with it 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.870
 by the us and with will be in the water 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.580
 executive sanction sanctions west in 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.920
 russia begin to get used no one 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.810
 thinks Russian politicians are afraid now 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.580
 joking that hit for example in the list 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.440
 those who have states will be taken away 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.690
 property abroad has become a matter 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.599
 honorable thing is that the west is nothing but 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.720
 how go personality he can't 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.280
 invent saying that they have 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 there is still a shortage of specialists 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.019
 Russians know what to do with us 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.880
 fully understand what to do according to 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.950
 whatever degree of secrecy promised 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.060
 West Russia themselves inhabitants of Crimea for example 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.160
 sigh with relief 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.290
 they joke which is worse than when they lived in 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.260
 so open to the western world Ukraine 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.260
