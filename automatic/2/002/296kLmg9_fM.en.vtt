that<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.370> doesn't<00:00:35.730> need<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> know

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that but it really doesn't need to know

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030

episodes<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.520> wants<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.390> equal

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
episodes now he wants to be on equal

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
episodes now he wants to be on equal
standing<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.470> nice<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.950> one's<00:01:32.070> nice<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
leave his solitude of being the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
leave his solitude of being the
strongest<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> guess<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.030> gets<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
strongest so I guess more will gets the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
strongest so I guess more will gets the
Strongs<00:01:36.479> Power<00:01:36.750> tries<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> beat<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> nice<00:01:37.829> now

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
really this is interesting yes but as

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
really this is interesting yes but as
it's<00:01:40.770> higher<00:01:40.950> goal<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.640> trying<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> make

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's higher goal of trying to make

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.609 
it's higher goal of trying to make
everybody<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.810> death<00:01:43.049> where<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:43.409> lose<00:01:43.560> their

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
everybody go death where they lose their

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.649 
everybody go death where they lose their
hearing<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.670> they'll<00:01:45.030> realize<00:01:45.360> how

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
hearing and then they'll realize how

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
hearing and then they'll realize how
weak<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.500> where<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:46.740> could<00:01:46.890> give

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
weak they are just where he could give

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
weak they are just where he could give
them<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> minimum<00:01:47.490> power<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.540> sounds<00:01:49.020> very

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
them a minimum power just sounds very

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.190 
them a minimum power just sounds very
stupid<00:01:49.710> his<00:01:50.130> entire<00:01:50.610> logic<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.869> type

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
stupid his entire logic to the what type

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
stupid his entire logic to the what type
of<00:01:52.229> goal<00:01:52.619> he<00:01:52.860> has<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.700> does<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.000> sound<00:01:54.240> good

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of goal he has just does not sound good

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
of goal he has just does not sound good
at<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.049> interesting<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.399> I'll

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
even an ending this ain't even a

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.680 
even an ending this ain't even a
conclusion<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.220> overall<00:02:53.579> plot<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:54.420> says

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
conclusion to the overall plot it says

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
conclusion to the overall plot it says
to<00:02:55.049> be<00:02:55.230> continued<00:02:55.890> after<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.519> credits<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.359> I'm

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
to be continued after the credits so I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.960

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
he's the enemy and he's shot nice it

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.490 
he's the enemy and he's shot nice it
doesn't<00:04:35.030> explain<00:04:35.270> exactly<00:04:35.600> why<00:04:35.960> he<00:04:36.199> would<00:04:36.350> do

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
doesn't explain exactly why he would do

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.990 
doesn't explain exactly why he would do
that<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.710> mean<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:37.010> was<00:04:37.100> obvious<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.910> know

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that I mean it was obvious that you know

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.550 
that I mean it was obvious that you know
art<00:04:38.270> would<00:04:38.449> eventually<00:04:38.660> tried<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.050> kill<00:04:39.229> nice

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
art would eventually tried to kill nice

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.290 
art would eventually tried to kill nice
because<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.190> mean<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.669> would<00:04:40.880> just<00:04:40.910> make<00:04:41.120> more

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
because I mean it would just make more

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.430 
because I mean it would just make more
sense<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:41.840> all<00:04:41.990> know<00:04:42.139> that's<00:04:42.350> just

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
sense like that all know that's just

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.640 
sense like that all know that's just
plot<00:04:42.740> design<00:04:43.070> laws<00:04:43.280> but<00:04:43.880> overall<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.260> villain

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
plot design laws but overall the villain

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.530 
plot design laws but overall the villain
was<00:04:45.770> very<00:04:46.160> uninteresting<00:04:46.820> at<00:04:46.970> first<00:04:47.240> he<00:04:47.419> was

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
was very uninteresting at first he was

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.360 
was very uninteresting at first he was
cool<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:48.169> then<00:04:48.320> he<00:04:48.410> became<00:04:48.650> uninteresting

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
cool but then he became uninteresting

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.159 
cool but then he became uninteresting
and<00:04:49.520> psychopath<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.449> just<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.870> know<00:04:50.990> had

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
and psychopath and just you know had

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.620 
and psychopath and just you know had
under<00:04:51.440> interesting<00:04:51.860> motives<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.430> so<00:04:52.910> we<00:04:53.449> have

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
under interesting motives and so we have

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.969 
under interesting motives and so we have
a<00:04:53.660> bunch<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.139> characters<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.590> had<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.740> lot<00:04:54.949> of

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
a bunch of characters I had a lot of

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.439 
a bunch of characters I had a lot of
potential<00:04:55.280> didn't<00:04:55.610> get<00:04:55.729> used<00:04:55.880> properly<00:04:56.240> if

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
potential didn't get used properly if

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.270 
potential didn't get used properly if
then<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.690> had<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> lot<00:04:57.169> of<00:04:57.320> filler<00:04:57.530> sections<00:04:58.070> in

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
then we had a lot of filler sections in

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.920 
then we had a lot of filler sections in
between<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.030> did<00:04:59.210> not<00:04:59.360> make<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.690> plot

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
between and did not make the plot

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.230 
between and did not make the plot
actually<00:05:00.470> flow<00:05:00.889> well<00:05:01.220> we<00:05:01.610> had<00:05:01.760> some<00:05:01.790> good

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
actually flow well we had some good

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.580 
actually flow well we had some good
character<00:05:02.750> backstories<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.290> certain

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
character backstories to certain

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.440 
character backstories to certain
characters<00:05:03.740> like<00:05:04.040> honey<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.520> three<00:05:04.760> but<00:05:05.300> they

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
characters like honey and three but they

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.150 
characters like honey and three but they
never<00:05:05.660> got<00:05:05.870> really<00:05:06.169> implied<00:05:06.500> more<00:05:06.740> into<00:05:07.040> we

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
never got really implied more into we

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.100 
never got really implied more into we
only<00:05:07.310> saw<00:05:07.580> some<00:05:07.970> episodes<00:05:08.479> that<00:05:08.660> really

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
only saw some episodes that really

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.960 
only saw some episodes that really
should<00:05:09.320> have<00:05:09.350> focused<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.010> character<00:05:10.820> Mel

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
should have focused on character Mel

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.610 
should have focused on character Mel
instead<00:05:11.330> like<00:05:11.479> cucumber<00:05:11.960> sword<00:05:12.200> fighting<00:05:12.440> I
