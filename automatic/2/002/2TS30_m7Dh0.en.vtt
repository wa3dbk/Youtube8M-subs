O'Brien who just who talked since the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
O'Brien who just who talked since the
whole<00:01:39.329> time<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> taking<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.680> away<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.130> him

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
whole time and taking it away at of him

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.859 
whole time and taking it away at of him
and<00:01:41.579> goes<00:01:41.700> exit<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.240> Ferris<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> get

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and goes exit even Ferris when you get

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.410 
and goes exit even Ferris when you get
international<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:44.100> international<00:01:44.970> level<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
international at international level I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.030 
international at international level I
suppose<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> biggest<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
suppose the biggest thing is that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
suppose the biggest thing is that
everyone<00:01:47.130> looks<00:01:47.460> after<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> wrong<00:01:47.939> job<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.540> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
everyone looks after the wrong job and I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
everyone looks after the wrong job and I
think<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> case<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.920> no<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
think that's the case and no one want to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
think that's the case and no one want to
be<00:01:51.960> any<00:01:52.110> extra<00:01:52.530> wage<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.979> Rory<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.460> deal<00:01:53.640> with

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
be any extra wage for Rory to deal with

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.550 
be any extra wage for Rory to deal with
and<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.420> everyone<00:01:54.689> performs<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> best

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and if everyone performs to the best

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.030 
and if everyone performs to the best
durability<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.750> makes<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:58.350> job<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.770> awful

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
durability and makes his job an awful

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
durability and makes his job an awful
lot<00:01:59.130> easier<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> justice<00:01:59.880> Rory<00:02:00.299> worried

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
lot easier and justice Rory worried

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
lot easier and justice Rory worried
about<00:02:00.840> himself<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.619> an<00:02:01.950> ideal<00:02:02.399> situation

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
about himself that's an ideal situation

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.359 
about himself that's an ideal situation
but<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.740> away<00:02:04.890> from<00:02:05.159> go

what<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.380> know<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.710> was<00:02:31.370> within<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.910> yeah

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
what you know you was within you yeah

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.600 
what you know you was within you yeah
this<00:02:32.420> was<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.770> honest<00:02:33.980> wasn't<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
this was a be honest wasn't just the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.920 
this was a be honest wasn't just the
media<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.000> well<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.330> was<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> players<00:02:35.750> were

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
media as well it was the players were

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.540 
media as well it was the players were
disappointed<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.770> how<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:37.040> were<00:02:37.190> attacking

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
disappointed with how we were attacking

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.510 
disappointed with how we were attacking
and<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.940> think<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.810> fair<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:40.160> improved

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
and I think to be fair now it's improved

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.520 
and I think to be fair now it's improved
an<00:02:40.730> awful<00:02:41.030> lot<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.420> suppose<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.110> biggest<00:02:42.380> thing

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
an awful lot I suppose the biggest thing

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.050 
an awful lot I suppose the biggest thing
is<00:02:42.710> though<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.040> not<00:02:43.250> proof<00:02:43.550> enough<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.940> get

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
is though it's not proof enough to get

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.400 
is though it's not proof enough to get
us<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.270> championship<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:44.870> that's<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
us a championship and that's what you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.980 
us a championship and that's what you
think<00:02:45.620> about<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:46.310> know<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.390> know<00:02:47.510> I

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
think about you know it's a you know I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.380
