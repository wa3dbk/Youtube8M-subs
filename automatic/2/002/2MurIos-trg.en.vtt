00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.560 
can see I have a couple restrictions set
and<00:04:39.190> if<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:39.580> go<00:04:39.700> inside<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.240> restriction

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
and if we go inside of that restriction

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.350 
and if we go inside of that restriction
we<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.410> limit<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.890> certain<00:04:42.250> fingers<00:04:42.790> setup

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
we can limit it to certain fingers setup

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.510 
we can limit it to certain fingers setup
and<00:04:43.540> touch<00:04:43.690> ID<00:04:43.900> when<00:04:44.530> we're<00:04:44.680> on<00:04:44.800> certain<00:04:45.130> Wi-Fi

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
and touch ID when we're on certain Wi-Fi

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.270 
and touch ID when we're on certain Wi-Fi
networks<00:04:45.850> or<00:04:46.210> even<00:04:46.960> using<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.740> standard

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
networks or even using a standard

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.880 
networks or even using a standard
passcode<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.150> it's<00:04:49.570> pretty<00:04:49.930> simple<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.440> setup

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
passcode so it's pretty simple to setup

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.950 
passcode so it's pretty simple to setup
and<00:04:51.220> very<00:04:51.580> easy<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.120> use<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.480> as<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.720> can<00:04:52.810> see<00:04:52.930> I

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
and very easy to use so as you can see I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.110 
and very easy to use so as you can see I
have<00:04:53.110> rearranged<00:04:53.560> icons<00:04:54.160> as<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.430> restriction

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
have rearranged icons as a restriction

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.150 
have rearranged icons as a restriction
and<00:04:55.240> if<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.660> tap<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.050> hold<00:04:56.080> on<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.380> icon<00:04:56.470> we<00:04:57.040> are

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
and if I tap and hold on the icon we are

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.160 
and if I tap and hold on the icon we are
forced<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.550> use<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.910> touch<00:04:58.150> ID<00:04:58.450> sensor<00:04:58.870> to

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
forced to use the touch ID sensor to

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.870 
forced to use the touch ID sensor to
unlock<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.800> feature<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.340> then<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.520> can<00:05:00.730> move

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
unlock that feature and then I can move

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.940 
unlock that feature and then I can move
the<00:05:01.090> apps<00:05:01.240> around<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:02.050> same<00:05:02.290> goes<00:05:02.620> with

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
the apps around the same goes with

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.190 
the apps around the same goes with
locking<00:05:03.550> apps<00:05:03.790> so<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.150> have<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.600> app<00:05:04.720> store<00:05:04.990> set

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
locking apps so I have the app store set

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.660 
locking apps so I have the app store set
as<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.410> restriction<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.160> if<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.340> try<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.550> enter

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
as a restriction and if I try to enter

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.610 
as a restriction and if I try to enter
it<00:05:07.030> I'm<00:05:07.180> going<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.630> be<00:05:07.780> forced<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.170> use<00:05:08.260> touch

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
it I'm going to be forced to use touch

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.490 
it I'm going to be forced to use touch
ID<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.100> authenticate<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.240> action<00:05:10.870> like<00:05:11.350> I

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
ID to authenticate that action like I

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.810 
ID to authenticate that action like I
said<00:05:11.770> there<00:05:11.980> are<00:05:12.010> tons<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.640> features

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
available for bio lockdown you can lock

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.610 
available for bio lockdown you can lock
up<00:05:15.910> different<00:05:16.240> toggles<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:17.230> can<00:05:17.410> lock

different apps you can lock different
settings<00:05:20.080> panes<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:20.980> can<00:05:21.190> pretty<00:05:21.520> much<00:05:21.700> lock

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
settings panes you can pretty much lock

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.510

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
able to access it with touch ID so it's

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.980 
able to access it with touch ID so it's
a<00:05:27.520> pretty<00:05:27.670> cool<00:05:27.820> tweak<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:28.660> highly
