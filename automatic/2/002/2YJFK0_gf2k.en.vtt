00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
on the top part one on the side sections

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
on the top part one on the side sections
you<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.369> triple<00:00:17.820> layer<00:00:18.060> rip<00:00:18.420> stop

you have your triple layer rip stop
material<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.289> rather<00:00:19.410> than<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.740> being

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
material so rather than it just being

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
material so rather than it just being
one<00:00:20.250> round<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.609> rip<00:00:20.789> stop<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.750> have

one round of rip stop you actually have
three<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.350> that's<00:00:22.470> three<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.920> through<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
three so that's three going through the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
three so that's three going through the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
top and three going through the side

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.970 
top and three going through the side
there<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.289> means<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.800> nice

zip system on there Social Security is a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
zip system on there Social Security is a
nice<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.270> nice<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.079> feature

nice bit of you know nice little feature

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890 
nice bit of you know nice little feature
that<00:01:31.409> Gregory<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> added<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that Gregory have added to it so the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.700 
that Gregory have added to it so the
main<00:01:34.079> entry<00:01:34.560> point<00:01:35.030> simple<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> if

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
main entry point simple as that and if

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.990 
main entry point simple as that and if
we're<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> inside<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.909> it

we're going the inside as you can see it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.210 
we're going the inside as you can see it
there's<00:01:39.150> pretty<00:01:39.360> much<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.220> standard

the back system which I will show you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.190 
the back system which I will show you
briefly<00:01:46.560> yet<00:01:47.100> again<00:01:47.280> nice<00:01:48.030> quick<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> easy<00:01:48.899> to

again<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.590> standard<00:02:08.099> feature<00:02:08.310> throughout

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
again is a standard feature throughout

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.240 
again is a standard feature throughout
all<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.450> rock<00:02:09.660> sacks<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.530> let<00:02:10.890> me<00:02:11.009> just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
all the rock sacks now let me just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.119 
all the rock sacks now let me just
briefly<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.849> down<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
briefly put this down here

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.770 
briefly put this down here
and<00:02:13.249> I<00:02:13.400> will<00:02:13.609> actually<00:02:13.700> show<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.359> so<00:02:14.629> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and I will actually show you so the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.839 
and I will actually show you so the
bladder<00:02:15.019> itself<00:02:15.200> actually<00:02:16.129> fits<00:02:16.609> in<00:02:16.790> that

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
bladder itself actually fits in that

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.520 
bladder itself actually fits in that
back<00:02:17.299> compartment<00:02:17.719> net<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.469> not

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
back compartment net so it's not

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.569 
back compartment net so it's not
actually<00:02:18.829> interfering<00:02:19.189> with<00:02:19.249> your<00:02:19.400> main

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
actually interfering with your main

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually interfering with your main
space<00:02:19.969> you<00:02:20.510> pop<00:02:20.749> it<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:20.989> there<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.349> away<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
space you pop it in there and away you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.940 
space you pop it in there and away you
go

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
go

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.410 
go
and<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.310> quite<00:02:22.489> literally<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.879> comes<00:02:23.269> out

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and it quite literally just comes out

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.929 
and it quite literally just comes out
the<00:02:23.569> top<00:02:23.599> section<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:25.129> pretty<00:02:25.519> much<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.849> the

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
the top section or pretty much on the

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.339 
the top section or pretty much on the
side<00:02:26.120> section<00:02:26.540> there<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:26.719> then<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.019> hook<00:02:27.170> it

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
side section there and then you hook it

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.740 
side section there and then you hook it
up<00:02:27.499> to<00:02:28.249> the<00:02:28.340> actual<00:02:28.549> clip<00:02:28.819> system<00:02:29.299> there

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
up to the actual clip system there

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.660 
up to the actual clip system there
simple<00:02:30.319> easy<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.159> works<00:02:31.310> really<00:02:31.549> really

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
simple easy but it works really really

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.879 
simple easy but it works really really
well<00:02:31.969> now<00:02:32.629> the<00:02:32.689> back<00:02:32.900> system<00:02:33.230> itself<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.680> all

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
well now the back system itself is all

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.559 
well now the back system itself is all
about<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.370> flow<00:02:34.639> system<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.180> there's<00:02:35.329> not<00:02:35.420> an

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
about the flow system so there's not an

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.509 
about the flow system so there's not an
actual<00:02:35.750> blocker<00:02:36.109> she<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:36.709> saying<00:02:36.859> Ark<00:02:37.219> in

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
actual blocker she was saying Ark in

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.280 
actual blocker she was saying Ark in
here<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.269> with<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.540> actual<00:02:38.840> material

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
here but then with the actual material

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.849 
here but then with the actual material
itself

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
itself

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.949 
itself
it's<00:02:40.040> basically<00:02:40.579> causing<00:02:41.389> a<00:02:41.450> layer<00:02:41.659> between

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
it's basically causing a layer between

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.390 
it's basically causing a layer between
you<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.499> actual<00:02:42.709> rucksack<00:02:43.069> itself

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
you and the actual rucksack itself

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580 
you and the actual rucksack itself
enables<00:02:44.090> cool<00:02:44.299> air<00:02:44.480> pretty<00:02:44.719> much<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.439> go

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
enables cool air pretty much to go

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.500 
enables cool air pretty much to go
throughout<00:02:45.919> the<00:02:46.040> entire<00:02:46.400> rucksack<00:02:46.939> as<00:02:47.090> well

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
throughout the entire rucksack as well

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.300 
throughout the entire rucksack as well
as<00:02:47.629> on<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:47.900> back<00:02:48.079> keeping<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.769> cool<00:02:49.010> all<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
as on your back keeping you cool all the
