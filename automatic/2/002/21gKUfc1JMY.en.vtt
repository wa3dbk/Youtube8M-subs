you want to rather than open up cydia
later<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.850> add<00:03:52.030> them<00:03:52.240> in<00:03:52.450> it's<00:03:52.780> again<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
later and add them in it's again it's a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.170 
later and add them in it's again it's a
small<00:03:53.920> shortcut<00:03:54.459> but<00:03:54.640> again<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.030> an
