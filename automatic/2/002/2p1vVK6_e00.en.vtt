00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.740
 and as we are told in the summary what has been promised is from workers of this 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.360
 moto la valdivia running 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.990
 a piece of motorcycle of which only fifteen hundred units have been made 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.399
 they did in the year 2004 and they were sold 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.070
 All of them 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.850
 in the American market if we continue kandora then in your hopes or 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.749
 they shelter them in finding a second hand 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.339
 but of course povés 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 time to them and we were showing 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 let's go to the motor of this piece of motupe has thousand 832 centimeters 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.949
 cubic comes from the old brown 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.360
 As you can see, I feel that there is an engine 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 120 horsepower 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.900
 at 5 thousand revolutions per minute 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.710
 and after talking about the engine, it only takes a look at this 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.630
 motorcycle on the outside so that it is discount of one of the characteristics that has 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.430
 what is the distance how long is the one that is cast 6 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.130
 if we take the wheelbase 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.670
 this bike look one meter ninety centimeters 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.740
 and if we add it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.430
 we go to the end of the fork 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 exceeds two meters nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.390
 with everything and what you do you get on this bike 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.830
 that you realize the position a very comfortable position and that will give you 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.579
 an idea of ​​what it means 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.810
 the larroulet that is a motorcycle or videos by 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 e that bike to run or to that 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 sunoco to receive sensations 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.920
 to also receive air in the face and of course 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.240
 one thing is clear 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 It's a motorcycle to be watched 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 let's talk now a little bit of a month the fundamental event this motorcycle that is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.109
 The fork not only has a visually attractive design as you see 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.009
 but this design has a reason to be 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.570
 it is a motorcycle that is very long 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.340
 it weighs a lot 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.240
 and then braking may seem a bit complicated a priori because 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.030
 there mental a system the system is precisely this hairpin what does 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.800
 This here 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.560
 ee prevents it from shortening 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.359
 the sso of the axes at the moment in which we are this what does it mean 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.049
 we press the brake 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.890
 p the fork does not lean forward 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.389
 but it goes down 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.680
 this the vita as we did that the accésits to cort begins the braking 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.049
 much safer we can even slow down 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.499
 in the middle of a curve 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 we can catch the even faster than we think 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.920
 and we're going to continue talking about the brakes as is the front end 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.460
 us discs of 3 30 bitten 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.720
 for three pistols that in the front if we go to the party 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.029
 back we will see that it has 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:43.730
 A disc 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.010
 lie of 3 20 bitten by two pistons that are the p data of the braking 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.379
 for the amount of them 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.260
 on top of the motorbike and we drive it, we go to that type of braking 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.370
 the practical way 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.080
 to stop 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.909
 we are all braking with the high zone and dinner very well 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.549
 etc but it's not enough 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.889
 keach honda posse bet on his classic in braking duval cbs what 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.809
 it means that when we brake with the rear brake 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.599
 braking is shared 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.650
 between the rear wheel and the wheel 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.519
 forward if we really want to psoe stop this projectile 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.859
 the best we can do is combine the brakes 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.709
 We condemn the front of the bike and here I want to show you one thing 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.960
 is this game kiss the radiator 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.269
 which are designed mode of 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.370
 whale beard is a radiator of durán joined desperate technology 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.189
 that uses honda in moto gp this why to give it that cooling 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.370
 necessary more than necessary this motorcycle with which we will avoid any 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.730
 type of heating problems at the time of driving is accompanied we continue 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.260
 bring forward let's see 'the lighthouse' this lighthouse 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.780
 quentin has been a bit retro retro posner aspect is essentially more 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.859
 of 20 engineers have been looking forward to this bike and what is this 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.829
 Percent, you have to be a little better 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.679
 but this invites the mouth of the mask of the ghost of the film writes 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.679
 date not half hours as separate 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.620
 let's one of the most visual parts of this bike that are the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.920
 chrome-plated must take into account one thing this motorcycle is designed especially 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.980
 for the Americans and we already know all 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.000
 how are they with their things is a motorcycle as we said it is to see and about 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.909
 all being seen 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.950
 so if you want there to shine 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.300
 well do not eat of rossi 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.870
 that cleans the bike with spark 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.650
 and it would stay shining especially for that 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.590
 runs so much there is an important element that hides these chromed is the picture 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
 of controls 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.520
 it's an easy-to-see dashboard a very comfortable 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.000
 in you that has certain characteristics the first 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.770
 is that for ariam hygiene in Beijing in the cd emery kilometers per hour look 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.260
 miles per hour but there is the option below the handlebar support there is 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.340
 the option to motorcito 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.430
 to change it to kilometers per hour there is also another option and that is if 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.910
 at night the flash of this digital otamendi controls table does not turn out 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.720
 annoying also would have tec 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.880
 justine another little button here under 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.690
 where we are going to be able to vary the intensity of the light in this table 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.950
 controls as we have said is my duty and above all 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.050
 is very readable the information that you give the just the necessary 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.309
 and easy to drive 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.370
 álava talk about the consumption and capacity of this motorcycle 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.300
 Well, it must be said that in this deposit 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.599
 fit little more than 20 liters 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 I suppose no consumer of 1 7 liters at 100 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.779
 how is this bike has only one seat this because because in the united states 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.199
 is only approved for a person however 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.660
 the few units that have led to Spain are homologated for two 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:56.310
 people 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.699
 where the package is placed 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.080
 where I am seeing a position of course nará comfortable 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.379
 to get this 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.309
 we have to put this footrest 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.769
 obligatory to put them sounded footsteps that do not come standard and that enjoy more 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:13.769
 of 700 euros 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.510
 let's talk now about the little girl's shoes 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.870
 this wave rome driveway 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.979
 a 120 in front estimated 180 behind dunlop 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.770
 and radial here we are doing one thing the experiments with the soda 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.550
 because why do I dodge these specific tires for this bike 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.080
 what's wrong with it 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.180
 a quantity of wool 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.970
 greater if we do not put it on 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.360
 we can have problems 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.050
 good to say goodbye we're going to finish 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.189
 with a number 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.050
 the 36 because because this bike weighs 360 kilos 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.830
 and it has a price of 36 thousand euros 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.259
 I hope you liked it because things like this do not know every day
