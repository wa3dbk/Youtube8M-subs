at<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.279> face<00:00:26.520> design<00:00:26.880> using<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> fourth

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
at this face design using the fourth

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
at this face design using the fourth
mortar<00:00:28.290> the<00:00:28.470> fourth<00:00:28.710> mortar<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.329> in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
mortar the fourth mortar is down here in

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
mortar the fourth mortar is down here in
this<00:00:30.599> corner<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.800> plan<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.340> i'm<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this corner the plan is i'm going to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.479 
this corner the plan is i'm going to
switch<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.390> cannon<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
switch it with this cannon right here on

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.369 
switch it with this cannon right here on
so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> mortars<00:00:36.000> inside<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> base<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
so the mortars inside the base but that

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.590 
so the mortars inside the base but that
that<00:00:37.710> covers<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.430> outside<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> base<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that covers the outside of the base and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
that covers the outside of the base and
the<00:00:40.470> reason<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.010> effective<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.700> because

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the reason it's so effective is because

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
the reason it's so effective is because
against<00:00:42.270> bartsch<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.840> these<00:00:43.170> mortars<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
against bartsch all these mortars on the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.860 
against bartsch all these mortars on the
outside<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.670> base<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.530> target<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.250> our

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
outside of base so they target when our

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.060 
outside of base so they target when our
barbarians<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.990> archers<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.560> hitting<00:00:49.890> all

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
barbarians and archers are hitting all

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
barbarians and archers are hitting all
the<00:00:50.280> buildings<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.790> outside<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> base

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the buildings on the outside of the base

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
the buildings on the outside of the base
um<00:00:52.790> they<00:00:53.790> get<00:00:53.970> stopped<00:00:54.300> by<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> mortars<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
um they get stopped by the mortars so I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.030 
um they get stopped by the mortars so I
know<00:00:57.780> I've<00:00:57.870> already<00:00:57.989> started<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
know I've already started but this is

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.100 
know I've already started but this is
going<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.460> just<00:01:00.239> me<00:01:00.420> talking<00:01:00.780> about<00:01:00.870> my

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
going to be just me talking about my

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.770 
going to be just me talking about my
base<00:01:01.320> design<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.890> channel<00:01:02.160> 9<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:03.239> works<00:01:03.630> very

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
base design for channel 9 it works very

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.249 
base design for channel 9 it works very
well<00:01:04.049> um<00:01:05.090> it<00:01:06.090> has<00:01:06.329> stopped<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:07.020> away<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
well um it has stopped go away but

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
48-percent before it I usually just get

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
48-percent before it I usually just get
Town<00:01:10.710> Hall<00:01:10.950> sniped<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.399> here<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.790> yeah<00:01:12.030> stop

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
clan castle um I have my exposé in the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.029 
clan castle um I have my exposé in the
center<00:01:56.909> level<00:01:57.209> 3<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:58.109> deal<00:01:58.439> out<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> lot<00:01:58.889> of

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
center level 3 they deal out a lot of

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.069 
center level 3 they deal out a lot of
damage<00:01:59.249> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.729> there's<00:02:00.149> my<00:02:00.450> heroes<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
damage and then there's my heroes in the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.480 
damage and then there's my heroes in the
center<00:02:01.349> doing<00:02:01.679> out<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> damage<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
center doing out a lot of damage and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830 
center doing out a lot of damage and
then<00:02:02.670> obviously<00:02:02.819> my<00:02:03.149> dark<00:02:03.359> elixir<00:02:03.539> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
then obviously my dark elixir is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.399 
then obviously my dark elixir is
undertaking<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.499> to<00:02:05.099> upgrade<00:02:05.520> things<00:02:05.819> um

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
undertaking that to upgrade things um

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.230 
undertaking that to upgrade things um
but<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.919> is<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.099> very<00:02:08.340> good<00:02:08.399> balance<00:02:08.940> base

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
but so this is a very good balance base

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.690 
but so this is a very good balance base
it<00:02:10.170> does<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> double<00:02:10.890> GI<00:02:11.160> Beom<00:02:11.370> here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it does have this double GI Beom here

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.720 
it does have this double GI Beom here
stopping<00:02:12.030> hogs<00:02:12.560> hogs<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.860> their<00:02:14.040> tracks<00:02:14.370> for

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
people who still use them not too many

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.280 
people who still use them not too many
people<00:02:16.769> do<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.280> if<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.870> stops<00:02:19.170> them

now you see the air defenses are in the
center<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> base<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.680> help<00:02:25.920> against<00:02:26.460> drag

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
