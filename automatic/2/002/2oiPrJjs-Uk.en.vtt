hmm nice enough in his way I think in

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.780 
hmm nice enough in his way I think in
its<00:03:55.680> way<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.010> probably<00:03:56.100> nicer<00:03:56.460> than<00:03:56.730> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
its way is probably nicer than the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.250 
its way is probably nicer than the
bloody<00:03:57.030> Avengers<00:03:57.510> thing<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.230> not

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
bloody Avengers thing really this is not

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.840

some stupid thing that you don't want

there<00:04:25.800> which<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.190> now<00:04:26.310> fall<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.850> floor

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
there which is now fall on the floor

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
there which is now fall on the floor
where<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.539> can<00:04:27.690> stay<00:04:27.990> before<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.860> makes<00:04:29.009> its

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
where it can stay before it makes its

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.999 
where it can stay before it makes its

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
final move into the bin well I think

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.860 
final move into the bin well I think
after<00:04:32.759> that<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:33.270> we<00:04:33.419> can<00:04:33.569> assume<00:04:33.629> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
after that I think we can assume the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.300 
after that I think we can assume the
Avenger<00:04:34.229> stuff<00:04:34.440> really<00:04:34.650> isn't<00:04:34.740> very<00:04:34.830> good<00:04:34.979> but

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
Avenger stuff really isn't very good but

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.950 
Avenger stuff really isn't very good but
the<00:04:35.400> frozen<00:04:35.580> stuff<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.180> slightly<00:04:36.449> better<00:04:36.750> and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the frozen stuff is slightly better and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.510 
the frozen stuff is slightly better and
as<00:04:37.080> they<00:04:37.199> were<00:04:37.259> like<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.740> think<00:04:38.310> there<00:04:38.460> were

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
as they were like I think there were

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820 
as they were like I think there were
three<00:04:38.849> for<00:04:39.090> two<00:04:39.270> pounds<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.930> pound<00:04:40.229> world's<00:04:40.740> so

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
three for two pounds in pound world's so

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.960 
three for two pounds in pound world's so
they<00:04:40.949> probably<00:04:41.069> got<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.340> same<00:04:41.520> price<00:04:41.819> as<00:04:41.940> a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
they probably got the same price as a

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.399 
they probably got the same price as a
