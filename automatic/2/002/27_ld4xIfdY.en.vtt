00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.399
 it was one of the biggest construction sites 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.260
 european naval here in amsterdam more than 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.850
 20000 people participated in the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.220
 construction of merchant ships 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.390
 but in the early 80s facing the 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.580
 Asian competition 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.330
 the company goes bankrupt the docks 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.330
 are left abandoned 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.359
 I bought this crane it there are three 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.079
 years and I decided to make it a hotel 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.079
 with three bedrooms 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.470
 like all other cranes 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.470
 construction site it was in very bad condition 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.329
 most have been destroyed or are 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.530
 fell apart and this one it was 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.219
 really the last one that could be 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.219
 restored 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.490
 this crane has been relatively spared 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.810
 it was restored in its entirety and it took 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.340
 three years in fact the restoration has 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.140
 took a year but all the papers 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.150
 administrative the technological challenges 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.430
 and bringing to safety standards 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.970
 in total took three years to be 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.440
 honest 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.790
 at first I did not realize that there 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 would have so many difficulties for the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.180
 restoration 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 I bought them for one euro 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 but symbolic restore me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 cost 3 million euros there is only 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.390
 three rooms in the crane and we 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.759
 have to pay our debts 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.509

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.750
 slowly according to the direction of the wind and 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.860
 for safety requirements 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.570
