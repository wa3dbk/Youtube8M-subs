00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250 
into this promo blister took a lot of
hunting<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.310> find<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.869> kind<00:00:22.170> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
hunting to find this one just kind of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.050 
hunting to find this one just kind of
strange<00:00:22.619> there's<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> meowstic<00:00:23.820> ones

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
strange there's a lot of meowstic ones

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.109 
strange there's a lot of meowstic ones
but<00:00:24.990> no<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:27.980> check<00:00:28.980> yourself<00:00:29.070> Cameron<00:00:29.699> pop<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

off<00:00:32.000> nice<00:00:33.000> minty<00:00:33.780> also<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.950> bought<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
off nice minty also I bought this one
simply<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.440> has<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.690> chespin<00:00:39.690> coin

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
simply because it has the chespin coin

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
simply because it has the chespin coin
so<00:00:41.070> never<00:00:41.760> seeing<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> chessmen<00:00:42.719> coin<00:00:44.329> that's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
