00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.640 
an expressive silent electronic Sonics
and<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.850> my<00:01:43.330> job<00:01:43.600> was<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.960> make<00:01:44.080> sure<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
and so my job was to make sure that the

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.680 
and so my job was to make sure that the
electronics<00:01:45.159> were<00:01:45.340> working<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.270> everything

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
electronics were working and everything

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.540 
electronics were working and everything
was<00:01:46.810> exactly<00:01:47.140> right<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.710> we<00:01:48.070> had<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.400> special

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
was exactly right and we had a special

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.969 
was exactly right and we had a special
speed<00:01:49.030> control<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.869> had<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.050> control<00:01:50.290> that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
speed control and we had a control that

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.890 
speed control and we had a control that
if<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.430> wheels<00:01:51.640> went<00:01:51.970> too<00:01:52.150> fast<00:01:52.390> Wyndemere

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
if the wheels went too fast Wyndemere

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.749 
if the wheels went too fast Wyndemere
was<00:01:53.080> wet<00:01:53.259> they<00:01:53.440> would<00:01:53.590> slip<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.610> have<00:01:54.729> a

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
was wet they would slip and so we have a

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.540 
was wet they would slip and so we have a
control<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.360> stop<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:55.780> happening<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:57.340> my

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
control to stop that happening and so my

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.249 
control to stop that happening and so my
job<00:01:57.790> was<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.000> set<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.450> electronics<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.110> to

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
job was to set the electronics and to

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:08.400 
job was to set the electronics and to
ride<00:01:59.470> with<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> planes<00:02:06.990> predators<00:02:07.990> our<00:02:08.170> halls

I<00:02:33.030> think<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> railway<00:02:33.630> system<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.230> very<00:02:34.470> very

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
I think the railway system is very very

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.860 
I think the railway system is very very
efficient<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.310> I'm<00:02:35.580> amazed<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.300> many<00:02:36.510> trains

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
efficient now I'm amazed how many trains

you've got running through taipei
station<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.209> time<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.340> you've<00:02:41.340> only<00:02:41.489> got

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
station all the time and you've only got

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.820 
station all the time and you've only got
four<00:02:41.970> platforms<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> tra<00:02:43.110> trains<00:02:43.500> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
four platforms for the tra trains and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.800 
four platforms for the tra trains and
yet<00:02:43.950> you've<00:02:44.130> got<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.849> many<00:02:45.030> trains<00:02:45.420> running

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
yet you've got so many trains running

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.150 
yet you've got so many trains running
backwards<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.350> forwards<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.950> there's<00:02:47.100> a

backwards and forwards and there's a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.970 
backwards and forwards and there's a

really busy service and I think it's

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.490 
really busy service and I think it's
very<00:02:50.160> impressive<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.050> trains<00:02:52.260> we've
