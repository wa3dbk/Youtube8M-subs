00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 caution in recruiting

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.470
 the most unfriendly host and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.840
 arrogant benjamin castaldi the most 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.100
 boring and sebastian patrick the most 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.660
 old-fashioned it will make him happy

 cauet it promises a big atmosphere in 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.410
 the room and in the head tf1 stops the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.180
 distribution of person of interest before 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.310
 end of the season the series we saw 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.870
 last night will stop on April 17th in 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 fifteen days while it will still remain 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.040
 two episodes of this first season 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.230
 a weirdness noted by our colleagues 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.000
 TF1 TV two weeks to keep his 2 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.530
 last episodes for later we 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.380
 listen to alain carrazé's explanations 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.569
 our series specialist always a 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.030
 little particular 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.310
 we do in France around the seasons 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.870
 all of d diffusion in the United States ago 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.060
 always a kind of progression 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.250
 dramatic late-season end of 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.109
 season a kiff hanger end of season 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.160
 which usually prolongs the suspense 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.419
 to keep spectators waiting 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.979
 until the fall 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.660
 so it's true that it always seems 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.729
 a little weird it's a bit of a pity 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.979
 simply it 's not the episode that 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.410
 will be set aside never broadcast 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.669
 on tf1 but they go tf1 decides to them 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.680
 put aside the only thing we can 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.150
 hope is that late challenge to launch the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.889
 season 2 is the end of the question 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 one as quickly as possible from this 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.440
