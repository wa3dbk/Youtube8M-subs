00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.339
 hi my people this pirate of payments 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.070
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.860
 unlock some side returned before 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.929
 that we do not want to send you a little treat 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.670
 the war machine 26 with whom we were 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.189
 playing helped us unlock this 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.400
 character to unlock to the side 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.460
 returned we must win 25 bouts in 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.740
 king of the classic mill these combats 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.199
 they do not have to be consecutive but yes 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.890
 they must total 25 in other words 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.740
 If you must win 25 fights after winning 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.910
 the combat the number 25 does not appear a 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.370
 notification that we have 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.410
 unlocked and does not appear with a side 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.810
 returned on the list is recommended 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.220
 let's go to the option of bookmarks and 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.650
 that we realize that there is an error 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.720
 on the servers that causes the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.380
 character does not appear if this is not 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.380
 updated 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.190
 then we go to the list of players and 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.000
 we will see that already with a returned side has 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.000
 been unlocked 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.869
 and nothing until here my part leaves a 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.520
 comment and like the video if 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.009
