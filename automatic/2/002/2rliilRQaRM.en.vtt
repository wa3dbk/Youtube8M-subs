00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that says if you want to train for

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880 
that says if you want to train for
strength<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.480> training<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.750> strength<00:00:19.080> lift

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

strength just training for strength lift
weights<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.310> gym<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.760> that's<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> end<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
weights in the gym and that's the end of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
weights in the gym and that's the end of
it<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:22.109> there's<00:00:22.320> another<00:00:22.380> side<00:00:22.800> that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
it and then there's another side that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470 
it and then there's another side that
says<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.519> there's<00:00:23.880> potentially<00:00:24.449> some

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
says you know there's potentially some

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.140 
says you know there's potentially some
benefit<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.170> doing<00:00:25.320> both<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.910> know<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> know

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
benefit from doing both you know I know

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
benefit from doing both you know I know
I<00:00:27.300> actually<00:00:27.660> took<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> extreme<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.710> have

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
I actually took the extreme you have

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
I actually took the extreme you have
people<00:00:29.039> who<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.340> hybrid<00:00:29.789> athletes<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.300> Alex

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
people who are hybrid athletes like Alex

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.470 
people who are hybrid athletes like Alex
piada<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.830> guy<00:00:32.040> he<00:00:32.730> squats<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> deadlifts

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
piada this guy he squats and deadlifts

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.560 
piada this guy he squats and deadlifts
over<00:00:33.750> 700<00:00:34.230> pounds<00:00:34.649> meanwhile<00:00:35.010> he<00:00:35.250> also

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
over 700 pounds meanwhile he also

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
over 700 pounds meanwhile he also
competes<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.660> ultra<00:00:37.020> marathons<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.829> I'll

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
competes in ultra marathons so I'll

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
competes in ultra marathons so I'll
actually<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> link<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> description

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
actually put a link in the description

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
actually put a link in the description
box<00:00:39.899> below<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.260> his<00:00:40.559> website<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.790> QA

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
box below to his website and the QA

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.190 
box below to his website and the QA
where<00:00:42.480> you'll<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.600> able<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> learn<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> little

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
where you'll be able to learn a little

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.510 
where you'll be able to learn a little
bit<00:00:43.290> more<00:00:43.500> about<00:00:43.649> him<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> interest<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
bit more about him if that interest to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.860 
bit more about him if that interest to
you<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.860> really<00:00:46.860> what's<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.360> what

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
you so really what's my take on it what

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
you so really what's my take on it what
do<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.890> does<00:00:50.070> cardio<00:00:50.610> into<00:00:50.940> our

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
do I think how does cardio into our

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
do I think how does cardio into our
conditioning<00:00:51.420> work<00:00:51.539> fit<00:00:52.469> into<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
conditioning work fit into the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
conditioning work fit into the
programming<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> strength<00:00:54.899> athletes

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
programming of strength athletes

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
programming of strength athletes
somebody<00:00:55.620> whose<00:00:55.800> goal<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.489> stronger

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
somebody whose goal is to get stronger

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
somebody whose goal is to get stronger
so<00:00:57.949> basically<00:00:59.270> there's<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.359> concept<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> gpp

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so basically there's this concept of gpp

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.229 
so basically there's this concept of gpp
or<00:01:01.739> general<00:01:02.039> general<00:01:02.460> physical<00:01:02.850> preparedness

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
or general general physical preparedness

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.899 
or general general physical preparedness
that<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.809> developed<00:01:03.930> by<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> Russians

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
that was developed by the Russians

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
that was developed by the Russians
several<00:01:05.909> years<00:01:06.119> ago<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.530> idea<00:01:08.010> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
several years ago and the idea is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
several years ago and the idea is
essentially<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.060> able<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.600> increase

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
essentially if you're able to increase

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.160 
essentially if you're able to increase
your<00:01:10.670> general<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.710> physical<00:01:13.909> fitness

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
your general level of physical fitness

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
your general level of physical fitness
then<00:01:16.170> you'll<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.710> able<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> perform<00:01:17.850> better<00:01:18.360> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
then you'll be able to perform better in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.590 
then you'll be able to perform better in
the<00:01:18.720> gym<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> makes<00:01:20.610> sense<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.180> if

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the gym it kind of makes sense right if

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.429 
the gym it kind of makes sense right if
you're<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> shape<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.880> uncanny

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
you're really out of shape your uncanny

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
you're really out of shape your uncanny
conditioned<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.630> you're<00:01:27.869> doing<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
conditioned and you know you're doing a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
conditioned and you know you're doing a
squat<00:01:28.409> workout<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.610> fifth

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
squat workout and you're on your fifth

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.480 
squat workout and you're on your fifth
or<00:01:30.060> sixth<00:01:30.360> set<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> squats<00:01:31.340> chances<00:01:32.340> are

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
or sixth set of squats chances are

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.210 
or sixth set of squats chances are
you're<00:01:32.640> probably<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.360> tanked<00:01:34.220> but

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you're probably going to be tanked but

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.390 
you're probably going to be tanked but
if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.360> take<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.659> same<00:01:36.840> individual<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
if you take that same individual and you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.920 
if you take that same individual and you
actually<00:01:39.000> build<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.390> their<00:01:39.540> level<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
actually build up their level of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
actually build up their level of
physical<00:01:40.290> fitness<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.520> more

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
physical fitness and they're more

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
physical fitness and they're more
physically<00:01:42.420> conditioned<00:01:42.960> specifically<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
physically conditioned specifically the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.910 
physically conditioned specifically the
cardiovascular<00:01:44.579> system<00:01:45.049> then<00:01:46.049> perhaps<00:01:46.470> when

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
cardiovascular system then perhaps when

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
cardiovascular system then perhaps when
they<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.460> fifth<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.939> sixth<00:01:48.210> set<00:01:48.329> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they get to that fifth and sixth set of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
they get to that fifth and sixth set of
squats<00:01:48.659> they'll<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.280> bit<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.640> or

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
squats they'll have a little bit more or

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.100 
squats they'll have a little bit more or
left<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.540> they'll<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:51.990> bit

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
left you know they'll have a little bit

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.270 
left you know they'll have a little bit
more<00:01:52.229> energy<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.770> won't<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> quite<00:01:53.159> as

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
more energy that won't be quite as

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.760 
more energy that won't be quite as
winded<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.000> they'll<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> able<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.869> perform

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
winded and they'll be able to perform

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.859 
winded and they'll be able to perform
better<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.369> maybe<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.880> some<00:01:56.909> additional<00:01:57.390> sets

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
better and maybe do some additional sets

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.639 
better and maybe do some additional sets
do<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.860> work<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.329> turn<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.439> better

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
do more work and then in turn see better

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.690 
do more work and then in turn see better
results<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> being<00:02:04.590> said<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:05.250> that's<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
results so that being said if that's the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.419 
results so that being said if that's the
case<00:02:06.469> what<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.680> car<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.039> should<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> be

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
case what kind of car do should you be

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.609 
case what kind of car do should you be
doing<00:02:08.610> how<00:02:09.390> often<00:02:09.569> should<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.140> doing<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
doing how often should you be doing it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.400 
doing how often should you be doing it
things<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:12.239> bottom<00:02:12.540> line<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
things like that the bottom line is that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.620 
things like that the bottom line is that
there's<00:02:13.650> no<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:14.370> one-size-fits-all<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
there's no really one-size-fits-all it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.240 
there's no really one-size-fits-all it's
really<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> matter<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.230> personal<00:02:16.470> preference<00:02:16.860> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
really a matter of personal preference I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.020 
really a matter of personal preference I
personally<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.590> know<00:02:20.030> anybody

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
personally think that you know anybody

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.130 
personally think that you know anybody
whose<00:02:21.920> goal<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.520> fit<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.960> goal<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
whose goal is to be fit if your goal is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.500 
whose goal is to be fit if your goal is
fitness<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.460> know<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.820> general<00:02:27.030> fitness

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
fitness you know just general fitness

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.980 
fitness you know just general fitness
then<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.500> should<00:02:28.680> probably<00:02:28.710> be<00:02:29.040> doing<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
then you should probably be doing a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.300 
then you should probably be doing a
reasonable<00:02:30.990> amount<00:02:31.080> may<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.500> some<00:02:32.130> type<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
reasonable amount may be some type of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.610 
reasonable amount may be some type of
cardiovascular<00:02:32.850> conditioning<00:02:33.810> work<00:02:34.020> two<00:02:34.590> or

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
cardiovascular conditioning work two or

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
cardiovascular conditioning work two or
three<00:02:34.890> times<00:02:35.040> per<00:02:35.490> week<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.510> goal<00:02:36.690> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
three times per week if your goal is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.110 
three times per week if your goal is
strictly<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> strength<00:02:38.430> athletes<00:02:38.670> they

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
strictly to be a strength athletes they

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.380 
strictly to be a strength athletes they
like<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.330> power<00:02:39.570> lifter<00:02:40.640> then<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.240> it's

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
like a power lifter then you know it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.800 
like a power lifter then you know it's
going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:42.780> depend<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:44.510> your<00:02:45.510> time

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
going to really depend on what your time

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.350 
going to really depend on what your time
allows<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.770> what<00:02:47.700> your<00:02:47.850> current<00:02:48.030> state<00:02:48.330> of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
allows and what your current state of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.990 
allows and what your current state of
conditioning<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.880> know<00:02:50.970> obviously

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
conditioning is so you know obviously

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
conditioning is so you know obviously
your<00:02:51.600> primary<00:02:52.020> goal<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.350> always<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.040> be

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
your primary goal is always going to be

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.250 
your primary goal is always going to be
lifting<00:02:53.550> weights<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.660> not<00:02:54.960> want<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
lifting weights that I do not want to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.230 
lifting weights that I do not want to
take<00:02:55.440> away<00:02:55.590> from<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.640> where<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.150> get

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
take away from that that's where you get

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.170 
take away from that that's where you get
stronger<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> gym<00:02:58.080> lifting<00:02:58.350> weights<00:02:59.180> that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
stronger in the gym lifting weights that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.210 
stronger in the gym lifting weights that
being<00:03:00.510> said<00:03:00.780> there<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.320> certainly<00:03:01.680> benefit<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
being said there is certainly benefit to

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.910 
being said there is certainly benefit to
doing<00:03:02.250> some<00:03:02.580> type<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> conditioning<00:03:03.420> work<00:03:03.920> no

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
doing some type of conditioning work no

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.250 
doing some type of conditioning work no
you<00:03:05.700> kind<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> do<00:03:06.180> low<00:03:06.360> intensity<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
you kind of do low intensity which is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.860 
you kind of do low intensity which is
kind<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.650> say<00:03:07.890> walking<00:03:08.250> or<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.690> know

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
kind of like say walking or you know

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.160 
kind of like say walking or you know
maybe<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.950> very<00:03:11.280> light<00:03:11.580> bike<00:03:12.510> ride<00:03:12.810> something

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
maybe a very light bike ride something

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.330 
maybe a very light bike ride something
like<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.500> would<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.010> more<00:03:14.160> low

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
like that would be kind of more low

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460 
like that would be kind of more low
intensity<00:03:14.730> first<00:03:15.450> high<00:03:15.750> intensity<00:03:16.170> which

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
intensity first high intensity which

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.870 
intensity first high intensity which
would<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.800> sprinting<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:17.550> pushing<00:03:17.850> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
would be like sprinting or pushing a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.510 
would be like sprinting or pushing a
prowler<00:03:18.390> pulling<00:03:19.080> sleds<00:03:19.440> things<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.340> that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
prowler pulling sleds things like that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.080 
prowler pulling sleds things like that
so<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:21.570> should<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:22.080> doing<00:03:22.820> basically<00:03:23.820> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
so what should you be doing basically I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.790 
so what should you be doing basically I
don't<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:24.780> think<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.110> there's<00:03:25.320> any<00:03:25.500> one

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
don't really think that there's any one

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.140 
don't really think that there's any one
right<00:03:26.010> answer<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.580> really<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> matter<00:03:27.000> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
right answer it's really a matter of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.480 
right answer it's really a matter of
whatever<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.870> prefer<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.770> think<00:03:29.370> if

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
whatever you prefer to do I think if

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.380 
whatever you prefer to do I think if
you're<00:03:29.610> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:29.880> doing<00:03:30.000> high<00:03:30.360> intensity

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
you're going to be doing high intensity

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.600 
you're going to be doing high intensity
stuff<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.410> conditioning<00:03:31.950> then<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.430> should

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
stuff for conditioning then you should

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.430 
stuff for conditioning then you should
probably<00:03:32.640> limit<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.300> once<00:03:33.660> per<00:03:33.870> week<00:03:33.900> maybe

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
probably limit it to once per week maybe

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.380 
probably limit it to once per week maybe
twice<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.100> twice<00:03:35.700> per<00:03:35.970> week<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.240> you're

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
twice for make twice per week if you're

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.150 
twice for make twice per week if you're
in<00:03:36.450> very<00:03:36.600> good<00:03:36.720> shape<00:03:36.870> simply<00:03:37.740> because<00:03:38.010> those

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
in very good shape simply because those

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.260 
in very good shape simply because those
are<00:03:38.250> going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.459> much<00:03:38.640> harder<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.180> recover

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
are going to be much harder to recover

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.440 
are going to be much harder to recover
from<00:03:39.920> on<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.100> flip<00:03:41.280> side<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.150> want<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> be

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
from on the flip side if you want to be

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.510 
from on the flip side if you want to be
doing<00:03:42.600> more<00:03:42.810> low<00:03:43.020> intensity<00:03:43.440> stuff<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:44.010> would

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
doing more low intensity stuff I would

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.100 
doing more low intensity stuff I would
say<00:03:44.760> two<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.090> three<00:03:45.239> times<00:03:45.270> per<00:03:45.570> week<00:03:45.750> would<00:03:46.050> be

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
say two to three times per week would be

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.220 
say two to three times per week would be
a<00:03:46.410> reasonable<00:03:47.330> goal<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.630> do<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.930> kind<00:03:49.140> of

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
a reasonable goal to do that kind of

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.800 
a reasonable goal to do that kind of
work<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:50.520> finally<00:03:51.090> what<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.300> want<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.630> say

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
work and then finally what I want to say

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.860 
work and then finally what I want to say
is<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.350> know<00:03:53.070> have<00:03:53.670> fun<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.270> cardio

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
is you know have fun with your cardio

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.540 
is you know have fun with your cardio
and<00:03:55.140> your<00:03:55.230> conditioning<00:03:55.739> work<00:03:55.890> if<00:03:56.130> your

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and your conditioning work if your

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.190 
and your conditioning work if your

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
powerlifting me but you know that kind

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.220 
powerlifting me but you know that kind
of<00:04:11.610> stuff<00:04:11.670> is<00:04:12.000> great<00:04:12.209> for<00:04:12.480> conditioning<00:04:13.020> and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
of stuff is great for conditioning and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.470 
of stuff is great for conditioning and
it<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.860> know<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.850> as<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.120> build<00:04:15.270> up<00:04:15.390> your

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
it you know you as you build up your

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.180 
it you know you as you build up your
physical<00:04:15.959> fitness<00:04:16.169> level<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.950> should

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
physical fitness level you should

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.380 
physical fitness level you should
hopefully<00:04:17.400> be<00:04:17.609> able<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.030> increase<00:04:18.299> your

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
hopefully be able to increase your

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.349 
hopefully be able to increase your
capacity<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> gym<00:04:19.500> now<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.430> wanted<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.000> talk

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
capacity in the gym now I wanted to talk

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.940 
capacity in the gym now I wanted to talk
about<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.750> more<00:04:21.900> note<00:04:22.080> about<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.410> idea<00:04:22.890> of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
about one more note about this idea of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.930 
about one more note about this idea of
work<00:04:23.130> capacity

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
work capacity

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.210 
work capacity
and<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:25.170> don't<00:04:25.290> simply<00:04:25.830> build<00:04:26.010> more

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
and that is you don't simply build more

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.820 
and that is you don't simply build more
capacity<00:04:26.490> by<00:04:27.300> doing<00:04:27.720> conditioning<00:04:28.050> work<00:04:28.530> a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
capacity by doing conditioning work a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.680 
capacity by doing conditioning work a
great<00:04:29.460> way<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.670> build<00:04:29.850> work<00:04:30.090> capacity<00:04:30.240> is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
great way to build work capacity is

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.010 
great way to build work capacity is
actually<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.560> gym<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.520> can<00:04:32.820> actually

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
actually in the gym so you can actually

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.390 
actually in the gym so you can actually
manipulate<00:04:34.020> things<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.920> your<00:04:35.160> breasts

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
manipulate things like your breasts

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
manipulate things like your breasts
intervals<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.330> could<00:04:36.600> try<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.230> shorten

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
intervals so you could try and shorten

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.990 
intervals so you could try and shorten
your<00:04:37.650> rest<00:04:37.860> intervals<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.820> can

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
your rest intervals to see if you can

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.750 
your rest intervals to see if you can
kind<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:40.380> know<00:04:40.410> go<00:04:40.950> into<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.220> next<00:04:41.400> set

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
kind of you know go into the next set

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.430 
kind of you know go into the next set
where<00:04:42.030> you're<00:04:42.180> not<00:04:42.360> quite<00:04:42.720> as<00:04:42.900> recovered<00:04:43.350> as

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
where you're not quite as recovered as

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.540 
where you're not quite as recovered as
you<00:04:43.560> were<00:04:43.650> before<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.040> build<00:04:44.400> up<00:04:44.490> your

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
you were before and build up your

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.640 
you were before and build up your
endurance<00:04:44.730> that<00:04:45.180> way<00:04:45.420> you<00:04:45.990> can<00:04:46.170> try<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.410> add

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
endurance that way you can try and add

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.500 
endurance that way you can try and add
more<00:04:46.860> volume<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.280> your<00:04:47.430> workouts<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.180> that

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
more volume to your workouts and that

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.300 
more volume to your workouts and that
will<00:04:48.660> also<00:04:48.990> build<00:04:49.200> your<00:04:49.530> work<00:04:49.680> capacity<00:04:49.830> in

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
will also build your work capacity in

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.400 
will also build your work capacity in
the<00:04:50.400> gym<00:04:50.610> now<00:04:50.850> I'm<00:04:51.510> going<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.900> finish<00:04:52.110> with

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
the gym now I'm going to finish with

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.450 
the gym now I'm going to finish with
