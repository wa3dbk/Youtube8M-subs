percent<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> popping<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
percent so this is popping out a very

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.359 
percent so this is popping out a very
huge<00:01:14.580> download<00:01:15.500> probably<00:01:16.500> miss<00:01:16.710> most<00:01:16.950> likely

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
huge download probably miss most likely

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.260 
huge download probably miss most likely
probably<00:01:17.850> maybe<00:01:18.329> 20<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.400> 40<00:01:20.400> mil<00:01:20.579> about<00:01:20.820> stops

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably maybe 20 to 40 mil about stops

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
probably maybe 20 to 40 mil about stops
so<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> nothing<00:01:22.200> too<00:01:22.350> big<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.159> now

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so it's nothing too big so well now

we're gonna be going into the operating
screen<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.799> there<00:01:26.040> should

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
screen here in a bit where there should

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
screen here in a bit where there should
boost<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.220> guys<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.579> tell

upload for an installment probably might

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.889 
upload for an installment probably might
take<00:01:46.889> a<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.609> loading<00:01:47.999> screen<00:01:48.030> I've

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
take a bit on this loading screen I've

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.779 
take a bit on this loading screen I've
been<00:01:49.049> sitting<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.679> about<00:01:49.920> pretty<00:01:50.579> close

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
been sitting here for about pretty close

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.160 
been sitting here for about pretty close
to<00:01:50.939> two<00:01:51.119> minutes<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.569> now<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.049> only

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
to two minutes right now and it's only

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.599 
to two minutes right now and it's only
down<00:01:52.469> up<00:01:52.649> 31<00:01:53.039> percent

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
down up 31 percent

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.959 
down up 31 percent
so<00:01:55.039> it's<00:01:56.039> kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.249> weird<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so it's kind of weird that this is

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
so it's kind of weird that this is
actually<00:01:57.270> taking<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.749> bit<00:01:57.990> especially<00:01:58.829> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
actually taking a bit especially just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.690 
actually taking a bit especially just
for<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.729> maybe<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.060> 40<00:02:00.539> or<00:02:01.109> so<00:02:01.579> middle<00:02:02.579> byte

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
for like maybe a 40 or so middle byte

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
for like maybe a 40 or so middle byte
download<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.749> a<00:02:03.899> little<00:02:04.139> weird

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
download which is kind of a little weird

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.459 
download which is kind of a little weird
