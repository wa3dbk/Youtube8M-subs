00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
recipe they can smoggy and then our

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.210 
recipe they can smoggy and then our
acumen<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.470> smoking<00:01:02.860> grains<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.629> we

Kentucky<00:01:10.900> touch<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:11.979> on<00:01:13.290> further<00:01:14.290> thought

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
Kentucky touch on it on further thought

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.800 
Kentucky touch on it on further thought
I<00:01:14.560> thought<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.100> know<00:01:15.220> what<00:01:15.909> smoke<00:01:16.330> flavoring

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
I thought you know what smoke flavoring

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.020 
I thought you know what smoke flavoring
is<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.290> basically<00:01:17.470> ash<00:01:17.890> falling<00:01:18.310> on<00:01:18.549> something

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
is is basically ash falling on something

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.420 
is is basically ash falling on something
and<00:01:19.180> then<00:01:19.840> getting<00:01:20.020> transferred<00:01:20.620> to<00:01:20.830> that<00:01:21.010> to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
and then getting transferred to that to

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.910 
and then getting transferred to that to
the<00:01:21.520> mash<00:01:21.730> so<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:23.140> went<00:01:23.320> with<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.530> idea<00:01:23.860> of

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
the mash so really went with the idea of

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.470 
the mash so really went with the idea of
a<00:01:24.130> smoking<00:01:24.790> rain<00:01:25.000> first<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:26.020> kind<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.480> mild

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
a smoking rain first to kind of mild

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.410 
a smoking rain first to kind of mild
smoke<00:01:29.200> flavors<00:01:29.650> put<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:29.980> that<00:01:30.130> mole<00:01:30.370> just<00:01:31.330> to

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
smoke flavors put on that mole just to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.120 
smoke flavors put on that mole just to
put<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.720> little<00:01:32.110> bit<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.320> that<00:01:32.350> smoke<00:01:32.650> flavor<00:01:32.920> in

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
put a little bit of that smoke flavor in

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.580 
put a little bit of that smoke flavor in
there<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.970> pineapple<00:01:34.540> on<00:01:34.630> their<00:01:34.810> other<00:01:35.260> hand

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
there the pineapple on their other hand

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.680 
there the pineapple on their other hand
was<00:01:35.800> just<00:01:35.830> caramelized<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.850> then<00:01:37.000> chopped<00:01:37.450> up

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
was just caramelized and then chopped up

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.070 
was just caramelized and then chopped up
put<00:01:38.440> into<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.890> lake<00:01:39.760> oil<00:01:39.970> just<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.720> kind<00:01:41.050> of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
put into the lake oil just to kind of

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.780 
put into the lake oil just to kind of
extract<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.590> sugar<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.040> whatever<00:01:42.340> flavor

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
extract that sugar and whatever flavor

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.190 
extract that sugar and whatever flavor
we're<00:01:43.120> talking<00:01:43.480> about<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.930> caramelized

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
we're talking about that caramelized

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.440 
we're talking about that caramelized
pineapple<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.100> think<00:01:45.310> that's<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.730> them<00:01:45.850> on

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
pineapple I think that's one of them on

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.330 
pineapple I think that's one of them on
this<00:01:46.690> one<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.260> only<00:01:47.380> unknown<00:01:47.650> part

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
this one this is the only unknown part

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.120 
this one this is the only unknown part
of<00:01:48.430> this<00:01:48.580> but<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.210> sounds<00:01:49.480> good<00:01:49.660> so<00:01:50.230> what's<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
of this but it sounds good so what's the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.610 
of this but it sounds good so what's the
worst<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.490> happen<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:52.450> brewed<00:01:52.690> 15<00:01:53.230> barrels

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
worst can happen we brewed 15 barrels

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.590 
worst can happen we brewed 15 barrels
were<00:01:53.770> infinite<00:01:54.100> here<00:01:54.490> we're

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
were infinite here we're

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.670 
were infinite here we're
about<00:01:56.350> 45<00:01:56.920> barrels<00:01:57.220> worth<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.820> at<00:01:58.060> Carton

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
about 45 barrels worth of it at Carton

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.249 
that every time people come in to brew
with<00:02:06.759> us<00:02:06.940> it's<00:02:07.299> always<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.990> be<00:02:08.080> an
