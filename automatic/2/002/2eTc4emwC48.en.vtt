piece of curly maple and to give you an
idea<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:25.010> why<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> cut<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.609> i<00:00:26.789> did<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> get

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
idea of why I cut it like i did to get

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500 
idea of why I cut it like i did to get
the<00:00:27.630> most<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.640> here's<00:00:29.640> an<00:00:29.939> example<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the most out of it here's an example of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.770 
the most out of it here's an example of
what<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> looks<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.289> after<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.800> been

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
what it looks like after it's been

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
what it looks like after it's been
stained<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.079> finished<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> scrap

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
stained and finished this is a scrap

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
stained and finished this is a scrap
piece<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.870> i<00:00:36.960> cut<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:37.590> made<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
piece that i cut off and i made this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
piece that i cut off and i made this
round<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> i'm<00:00:39.660> pretty<00:00:40.110> motivated<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
round so i'm pretty motivated to get the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
round so i'm pretty motivated to get the
most<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> piece<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.390> give<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
most out of this piece as i can give a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
most out of this piece as i can give a
really<00:00:43.620> exciting<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:45.649> when<00:00:46.649> i<00:00:46.680> cut<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
really exciting would when i cut the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
really exciting would when i cut the
round<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.640> though<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
round out though you can see that this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
round out though you can see that this
portion<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.449> nice<00:00:51.750> big<00:00:51.989> void<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.570> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
portion here is a nice big void and that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
portion here is a nice big void and that
causes<00:00:54.930> problems<00:00:55.590> typically<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
causes problems typically when you go to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
causes problems typically when you go to
start<00:00:56.850> turning<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.420> started<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
start turning i started this and then I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.500 
start turning i started this and then I
thought<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.640> think<00:00:59.969> I'll<00:01:00.239> demonstrate

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
thought well I think I'll demonstrate

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
thought well I think I'll demonstrate
the<00:01:01.170> people<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> Tool<00:01:03.120> Works<00:01:03.979> again<00:01:04.979> this

the people how the Tool Works again this
is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> tool<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> I'd<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:08.070> uses<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
is a tool that I'd make and it uses a

is a tool that I'd make and it uses a
quarter<00:01:09.630> inch<00:01:09.810> cobalt<00:01:10.260> steel<00:01:10.920> inserts<00:01:12.170> we're

a scraper the wood doesn't seem to care
what<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.500> were<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.860> used<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.310> describe

what you what were you used to describe

what you what were you used to describe
it<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.450> goes<00:01:21.659> away<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> let<00:01:23.490> me<00:01:23.580> show<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.799> how

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
it it goes away so let me show you how

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
it it goes away so let me show you how
when<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.790> tool<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.299> such<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> cut

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
when you use this tool for such a cut

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
when you use this tool for such a cut
and<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> nice<00:01:29.070> example<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.909> an

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and this is a nice example of an

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.670 
and this is a nice example of an
interrupted<00:01:30.570> cut<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:32.159> doesn't<00:01:32.610> bounce<00:01:32.850> or

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
interrupted cut it doesn't bounce or

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.730 
interrupted cut it doesn't bounce or
grab<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:35.670> trying<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.540> shake<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.320> too<00:01:37.500> badly

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
grab or trying to shake you too badly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
grab or trying to shake you too badly
I've<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.579> pretty<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:39.030> balanced<00:01:39.540> at

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
I've got this pretty well balanced at

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.880 
I've got this pretty well balanced at
the<00:01:39.840> speed<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.530> let's<00:01:40.740> run<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.070> up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.810 

giving<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.570> ground<00:01:50.570> elder

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
giving the ground elder

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:04.560 
giving the ground elder
that<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.480> can<00:01:52.630> go<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.780> my<00:01:52.960> dell<00:02:03.270> advocacy<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.300> can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
that I can go to my dell advocacy I can

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:33.720 
that I can go to my dell advocacy I can
go<00:02:04.690> pretty<00:02:04.840> quick

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.820 

I<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.599> general<00:02:37.840> people<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.530> i<00:02:38.590> end<00:02:38.739> up

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I know the general people and i end up

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.320 
I know the general people and i end up
with<00:02:38.890> i'm<00:02:39.340> going<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.549> start<00:02:39.760> going<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.209> that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
with i'm going to start going in that

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.820 
with i'm going to start going in that
direction<00:02:40.390> i<00:02:40.959> think<00:02:41.170> I'll<00:02:41.260> speed<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.680> a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
direction i think I'll speed it up a

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.240 
direction i think I'll speed it up a
little<00:02:41.950> bit<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:44.170> was<00:02:44.349> cool<00:02:44.590> does<00:02:44.799> work<00:02:45.040> better

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
little bit it was cool does work better

00:02:45.250 --> 00:03:58.980 
little bit it was cool does work better
the<00:02:45.610> faster<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.150> spin

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.600 

there<00:03:59.990> we<00:04:00.170> go

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.070 

and<00:04:07.610> it's<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.360> little<00:04:08.540> bit<00:04:08.660> more<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.870> go

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
and it's just a little bit more to go

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.800 
and it's just a little bit more to go
that<00:04:09.500> breakout<00:04:10.310> piece<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.030> then<00:04:11.120> I've<00:04:11.390> got<00:04:11.420> it

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
that breakout piece and then I've got it

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.740 
that breakout piece and then I've got it
that<00:04:12.680> maximum<00:04:13.250> round<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:13.760> can<00:04:13.970> continue<00:04:14.540> to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
that maximum round and I can continue to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.620 
that maximum round and I can continue to
make<00:04:14.900> my<00:04:15.050> bowl<00:04:15.880> that's<00:04:16.880> about<00:04:17.120> all<00:04:17.180> i<00:04:17.329> wanted

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
make my bowl that's about all i wanted

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.900 
make my bowl that's about all i wanted
to<00:04:17.690> show<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.169> just<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.980> little<00:04:19.700> quickly

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
to show you is just a little quickly
