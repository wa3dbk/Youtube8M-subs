the<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.640> end<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.549> facing<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the very end right there is facing and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.130 
the very end right there is facing and
touching<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:52.290> wire<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:53.070> underneath<00:01:53.430> it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
touching this wire that's underneath it

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.920 
touching this wire that's underneath it
so<00:01:55.140> um<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> start<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so um what I like to do when I start a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
so um what I like to do when I start a
memory<00:01:58.259> wire<00:01:58.439> bracelet<00:01:58.920> especially<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
memory wire bracelet especially if the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
memory wire bracelet especially if the
memory<00:02:00.210> wire<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.500> curly<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.130> hard<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
memory wire is kind of curly and hard to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.719 
memory wire is kind of curly and hard to
work<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.229> separate<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
work with I will separate the little

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.969 
work with I will separate the little
Springs

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
Springs

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.119 
Springs
and<00:02:07.610> then<00:02:08.060> give<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.690> couple<00:02:08.929> minutes<00:02:09.410> slinky

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
and then give it a couple minutes slinky

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.440 
and then give it a couple minutes slinky
gets<00:02:10.810> knotted<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:12.110> yep<00:02:12.500> definitely<00:02:12.769> so<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.940> will

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
gets knotted up yep definitely so I will

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.059 
gets knotted up yep definitely so I will
hold<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> like<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.349> actually<00:02:15.530> give<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
hold it like this and actually give it a

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.190 
hold it like this and actually give it a
couple<00:02:16.310> tugs<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.000> that's<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> kind<00:02:18.080> of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
couple tugs and that's going to kind of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.110 
couple tugs and that's going to kind of
stretch<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.709> memory<00:02:19.010> wire<00:02:19.190> out<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.940> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
stretch the memory wire out just a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.369 
stretch the memory wire out just a
little<00:02:20.420> bit<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.140> make<00:02:21.260> it

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
little bit and it's going to make it

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.009 
little bit and it's going to make it
easier<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:22.040> us<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.310> work<00:02:22.489> with<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:23.750> it's

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
easier for us to work with so now it's

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.130 
easier for us to work with so now it's
less<00:02:24.200> likely<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.620> tangle<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.180> what<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.019> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
less likely to tangle so what I like to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170 
less likely to tangle so what I like to
do<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.560> order<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.830> string<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:28.340> beads<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.940> kind

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
do in order to string my beads is I kind

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.880 
do in order to string my beads is I kind
of<00:02:29.269> use<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.750> memory<00:02:30.080> wire<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.769> a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
of use the memory wire like it's a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.440 
of use the memory wire like it's a
needle<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.400> I'll<00:02:31.519> scoop<00:02:31.849> up<00:02:32.030> some<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.300> the

get it on in the first place and then

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.180 
get it on in the first place and then

wire I sometimes take a sturdy head pin
and<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:33.200> will<00:03:33.380> grab<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.980> pliers<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.670> poke<00:03:35.239> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
and I will grab the pliers and poke it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.410 
and I will grab the pliers and poke it
through<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.260> very<00:03:36.500> good<00:03:36.739> tip<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:38.239> this

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
through that's a very good tip so this

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.750 
through that's a very good tip so this
is<00:03:38.569> what<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.290> far<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.799> notice<00:03:40.609> how

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
is what we have so far and notice how

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.670 
is what we have so far and notice how
the<00:03:40.819> little<00:03:41.150> curl<00:03:41.420> on<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.780> memory<00:03:42.319> wire<00:03:42.500> is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
the little curl on the memory wire is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.309 
the little curl on the memory wire is
stopping<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.220> beads<00:03:43.459> from<00:03:43.639> falling<00:03:43.730> off<00:03:44.319> now

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
stopping the beads from falling off now

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.150 
stopping the beads from falling off now
because<00:03:45.859> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.069> magic<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:47.000> youtube<00:03:47.389> video

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
because of the magic of a youtube video

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.890 
because of the magic of a youtube video
we're<00:03:49.160> going<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.849> move<00:03:50.030> on<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.329> this<00:03:50.450> bracelet

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
we're going to move on to this bracelet

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.920 
we're going to move on to this bracelet
that<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.079> have<00:03:51.290> almost<00:03:51.470> completed<00:03:52.389> so<00:03:53.389> I<00:03:53.450> just

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
that I have almost completed so I just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.440 
that I have almost completed so I just
have<00:03:54.109> a<00:03:54.139> little<00:03:54.849> earring<00:03:55.849> stopper<00:03:56.269> on<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
have a little earring stopper on the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.240 
have a little earring stopper on the
back<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.049> that's<00:03:57.349> one<00:03:57.620> tip<00:03:57.829> that<00:03:57.859> I<00:03:58.069> can

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
back of it that's one tip that I can

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.830 
back of it that's one tip that I can
share<00:03:58.400> with<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.700> if<00:03:58.880> you're<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.269> need

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
share with you if you're going to need

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.120 
share with you if you're going to need
to<00:03:59.959> take<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.139> break<00:04:00.380> halfway<00:04:00.620> through<00:04:01.010> your

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
to take a break halfway through your

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.800 
to take a break halfway through your
project<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.730> can<00:04:01.790> put<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> little<00:04:02.239> ear<00:04:02.599> wire

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
project you can put a little ear wire

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.449 
project you can put a little ear wire
stopper<00:04:03.319> on<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.709> and<00:04:03.889> it's<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.280> stop

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
stopper on it and it's going to stop

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.699 
stopper on it and it's going to stop
your<00:04:04.609> beads<00:04:04.790> from<00:04:04.880> falling<00:04:05.000> off<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.569> end<00:04:05.709> so

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
your beads from falling off the end so

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.610 
your beads from falling off the end so
this<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.609> what<00:04:07.790> I've<00:04:07.880> done<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.359> far<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:09.440> what

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
this is what I've done so far and what

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.680 
this is what I've done so far and what
I'm<00:04:10.220> going<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.400> need<00:04:10.579> to<00:04:10.730> do<00:04:10.880> is<00:04:11.120> take<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:11.419> memory

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
I'm going to need to do is take a memory

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.289 
I'm going to need to do is take a memory
wire<00:04:12.049> cutter<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.739> trim<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.609> down<00:04:13.849> so<00:04:14.150> it's

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
wire cutter and trim this down so it's

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.539 
wire cutter and trim this down so it's
about<00:04:14.569> twice<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.959> length<00:04:15.409> as<00:04:15.620> my<00:04:15.680> loop<00:04:16.220> on<00:04:16.400> the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
about twice the length as my loop on the

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.870 
about twice the length as my loop on the
other<00:04:16.579> side<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.260> is<00:04:18.890> very<00:04:19.280> important<00:04:19.820> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
other side so it is very important to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.940 
other side so it is very important to
make<00:04:20.000> sure<00:04:20.030> you're<00:04:20.299> using<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.870> specific<00:04:21.200> cutter

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
make sure you're using a specific cutter

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.740 
make sure you're using a specific cutter
for<00:04:22.430> memory<00:04:22.789> wire<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.060> can't<00:04:23.510> use<00:04:23.720> your

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
for memory wire you can't use your

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.839 
for memory wire you can't use your
regular<00:04:24.200> wire<00:04:24.380> cutter<00:04:24.710> because<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.669> will

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
regular wire cutter because it will

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.779 
regular wire cutter because it will
really<00:04:26.180> damage<00:04:26.720> your<00:04:26.900> cutter<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:28.039> when<00:04:28.460> we<00:04:28.610> did

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
really damage your cutter so when we did

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.520 
really damage your cutter so when we did
our<00:04:28.940> workshop<00:04:29.479> we<00:04:29.690> had<00:04:29.870> several<00:04:30.200> customers

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
our workshop we had several customers

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.380 
our workshop we had several customers
that<00:04:31.039> came<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.580> bought<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.880> memory<00:04:32.240> wire

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
that came in and bought the memory wire

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.240 
that came in and bought the memory wire
cutters<00:04:32.900> because<00:04:33.320> they<00:04:33.560> ruined<00:04:33.919> their

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
cutters because they ruined their

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.820 
cutters because they ruined their
regular<00:04:34.669> cutters<00:04:35.060> definitely<00:04:35.690> yup<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.320> we

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
regular cutters definitely yup so we

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.110 
regular cutters definitely yup so we
want<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.099> make<00:04:37.219> sure<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.729> when<00:04:37.969> you're

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
want to make sure that when you're

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.390 
want to make sure that when you're
cutting<00:04:38.409> you<00:04:39.409> either<00:04:39.680> put<00:04:39.979> your<00:04:40.010> finger<00:04:40.370> on

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
cutting you either put your finger on

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.399 
cutting you either put your finger on
the<00:04:40.640> other<00:04:40.760> end<00:04:41.000> here<00:04:41.390> so<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.020> little

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
the other end here so that the little

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.830 
the other end here so that the little
piece<00:04:42.560> doesn't<00:04:42.950> fly<00:04:43.130> off<00:04:43.159> or<00:04:43.610> kind<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.539> cover

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
piece doesn't fly off or kind of cover

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.459 
piece doesn't fly off or kind of cover
what<00:04:45.110> you're<00:04:45.260> cutting<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.229> little

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
what you're cutting because that little

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.670 
what you're cutting because that little
piece<00:04:48.760> hurts<00:04:49.760> when<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.419> yeah<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.200> hurts<00:04:51.440> when

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
piece hurts when you yeah it hurts when

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.310 
piece hurts when you yeah it hurts when
you<00:04:51.770> put<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.039> in<00:04:52.159> your<00:04:52.280> eye<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:53.300> now<00:04:53.960> what<00:04:54.200> we're

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
you put it in your eye so now what we're

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.450 
you put it in your eye so now what we're
going<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.469> do<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:54.770> take<00:04:54.950> our<00:04:55.159> round<00:04:55.370> nose

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
going to do is take our round nose

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.570 
going to do is take our round nose
pliers<00:04:55.820> again<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.830> just<00:04:57.830> very<00:04:58.250> carefully

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
pliers again and just very carefully

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.120 
pliers again and just very carefully
curl<00:04:59.680> it<00:05:00.680> backwards<00:05:01.280> on<00:05:02.120> itself<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.770> create

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
curl it backwards on itself to create

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.050 
curl it backwards on itself to create
that<00:05:04.340> last<00:05:04.700> loop<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:06.320> so<00:05:07.310> see<00:05:07.550> how<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.729> bead

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
that last loop and so see how the bead

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.920 
that last loop and so see how the bead
just<00:05:08.240> kind<00:05:08.479> of<00:05:08.599> tucks<00:05:08.870> up<00:05:09.110> there<00:05:10.599> so<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:11.750> looks

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
just kind of tucks up there so it looks

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.709 
just kind of tucks up there so it looks
like<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:15.500> our<00:05:15.530> last<00:05:16.190> step<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.390> add<00:05:17.599> a

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
like that so our last step is to add a

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.480 
like that so our last step is to add a
little<00:05:18.020> charm<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.740> can<00:05:18.890> choose<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.099> charm

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
little charm so you can choose a charm

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.070 
little charm so you can choose a charm
that's<00:05:19.700> symbolic<00:05:20.090> of<00:05:20.419> something<00:05:20.479> that<00:05:20.960> you're

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
that's symbolic of something that you're

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.770 
that's symbolic of something that you're
grateful<00:05:21.349> for<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.909> what<00:05:23.510> you're<00:05:23.630> going

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
grateful for and and what you're going

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.600 
grateful for and and what you're going
to<00:05:23.810> do<00:05:23.990> is<00:05:24.169> either<00:05:24.409> use<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.039> jump<00:05:25.370> ring<00:05:25.580> to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
to do is either use a jump ring to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.880 
to do is either use a jump ring to
attach<00:05:25.849> it<00:05:26.270> directly<00:05:26.630> onto<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.050> last<00:05:27.349> loop<00:05:27.650> or

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
attach it directly onto the last loop or

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.890 
attach it directly onto the last loop or
you<00:05:28.370> can<00:05:28.520> put<00:05:28.729> it<00:05:28.849> right<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.390> middle<00:05:29.570> of

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900
