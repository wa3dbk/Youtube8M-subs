00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.990 
hi I have so much work to do that I
thought<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.380> would<00:00:04.560> just<00:00:04.710> ignore<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:05.549> all<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
thought I would just ignore it all and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.670 
thought I would just ignore it all and
do<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.330> instead<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.200> lot<00:00:07.379> more<00:00:07.529> fun

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
do this instead this is a lot more fun

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.370 
do this instead this is a lot more fun
so<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.269> noodling<00:00:09.630> around<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.960> banjo

so I was just noodling around my banjo
and<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.620> thought<00:00:10.860> oh<00:00:11.130> no<00:00:11.580> she'll<00:00:12.570> teach<00:00:12.809> he

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
and I thought oh no she'll teach he

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
and I thought oh no she'll teach he
taught<00:00:13.950> another<00:00:14.160> tune<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.820> anybody<00:00:15.150> else

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299

you get the you know get that motion and
figure<00:01:12.710> out<00:01:12.830> how<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.190> turn<00:01:13.550> make<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.210> into<00:01:14.479> a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
song and I'm kind of a big proponent of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.570 
song and I'm kind of a big proponent of
playing<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.479> learning<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.200> few<00:01:18.410> tunes<00:01:18.860> just<00:01:19.490> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
playing of learning a few tunes just a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.940 
playing of learning a few tunes just a
few<00:01:19.880> note<00:01:20.810> by<00:01:21.470> note<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.550> can<00:01:22.700> see<00:01:23.090> how

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
few note by note so that you can see how

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.690 
few note by note so that you can see how
this<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:26.509> business<00:01:27.490> translates<00:01:28.490> into

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
this this business translates into

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.560 
this this business translates into
playing<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.420> tune<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.490> one's<00:01:31.670> nothing<00:01:32.450> to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
playing a tune and this one's nothing to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.450 
playing a tune and this one's nothing to
think<00:01:32.720> about<00:01:32.840> much<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:33.440> your<00:01:33.590> left<00:01:33.950> hand<00:01:34.220> so

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
think about much for your left hand so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.260 
think about much for your left hand so
it's<00:01:34.640> pretty<00:01:34.820> easy

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's pretty easy

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.080 
it's pretty easy
remember<00:01:36.110> bands<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.530> your<00:01:36.560> right<00:01:36.860> leg<00:01:37.160> make

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
remember bands on your right leg make

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.520 
remember bands on your right leg make
sure<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.390> knee<00:01:38.539> is<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:41.259> peghead<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
sure the knee is the peghead of the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.090 
sure the knee is the peghead of the
banjo<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.070> kind<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.869> aimed<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.590> little<00:01:45.950> more

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
banjo is kind of aimed a little more

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.960 
banjo is kind of aimed a little more
toward<00:01:46.340> corazon<00:01:46.820> ttle<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.340> all<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.640> action

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
toward corazon ttle so all the action

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.900 
toward corazon ttle so all the action
here<00:01:50.240> takes<00:01:51.020> place<00:01:51.320> at<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.890> third<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.789> the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
here takes place at the third of the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.290 
here takes place at the third of the
third<00:01:53.090> fret<00:01:53.479> pretty<00:01:53.810> much<00:01:54.880> there<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.060> this

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
third fret pretty much there is this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.830 
third fret pretty much there is this
been<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.200> key<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:58.069> a<00:01:58.220> it's<00:01:58.520> an<00:01:58.670> F<00:01:58.789> chord

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
been in this key it's a it's an F chord

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:09.999 
been in this key it's a it's an F chord
so

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:29.680 

so<00:02:10.550> here's<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.849> tune

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.150 

now<00:02:30.690> there's<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.989> couple<00:02:31.170> ways<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.739> talked<00:02:32.069> about

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
now there's a couple ways I talked about

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
now there's a couple ways I talked about
before<00:02:32.370> about<00:02:32.640> getting<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.660> two<00:02:37.019> in

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
before about getting that one and two in

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.119 
before about getting that one and two in
that<00:02:37.530> first<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.410> more<00:02:40.650> bum<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.880 
that first and so it's more bum and
Diddy<00:02:41.430> instead<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.910> bum<00:02:42.060> Diddy<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.629> those<00:02:43.590> are

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
Diddy instead of bum Diddy and those are

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.820 
Diddy instead of bum Diddy and those are
dropped<00:02:44.430> thumb

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
dropped thumb

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.539

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.900 
hammer one or one and two and pull off
or<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.060> two<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.489> there's<00:02:59.489> one<00:02:59.670> more

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
or one and two and and there's one more

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.280 
or one and two and and there's one more
way<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:00.660> worry<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.230> one

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
way that we don't worry about that one

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190 
way that we don't worry about that one
yet<00:03:01.519> so<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.880> couple<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.480> those<00:03:03.599> are<00:03:03.810> used<00:03:04.019> in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
yet so a couple of those are used in

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670 
yet so a couple of those are used in
here<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.360> your<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.599> we<00:03:06.720> call<00:03:06.930> your<00:03:07.049> basic<00:03:07.260> thing

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
here so your if we call your basic thing

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.420 
here so your if we call your basic thing

that's<00:03:47.700> my<00:03:48.090> fingers<00:03:48.660> playing<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.319> not<00:03:49.500> my

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
that's my fingers playing it not my

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.300 
that's my fingers playing it not my
phone<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.250> then<00:03:51.180> your<00:03:51.329> thumb<00:03:51.799> plays<00:03:52.799> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
phone and then your thumb plays the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.449 
phone and then your thumb plays the
second<00:03:53.940> string<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.389> case<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.250> first

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
second string in this case and the first

string and in the fifth string so the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.640 
string and in the fifth string so the
motion<00:03:59.419> for<00:04:00.419> your<00:04:00.480> hand<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> lot<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.349> going

seem to not if you focus on on keeping
your<00:04:38.360> thumb<00:04:38.600> at<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> glue<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.890> fifth

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
your thumb at the glue to that fifth

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.159 
your thumb at the glue to that fifth
string<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.910> pulling<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.330> off<00:04:41.570> pulling

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
string and just pulling it off pulling

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.830 
string and just pulling it off pulling
it<00:04:42.290> away<00:04:42.580> every<00:04:43.580> other<00:04:43.669> time<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.660> good

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
it away every other time that's a good

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:53.400 
it away every other time that's a good
thing<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.140> go<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:48.140> anyway<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.370> went

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.750 

that's<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.530> third<00:04:54.740> string<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.690> open<00:04:57.760> so

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
that's a third string and it open so

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.909 
that's a third string and it open so
again<00:04:59.060> that's<00:05:05.620> okay

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
again that's okay

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.590 
again that's okay
the<00:05:07.190> next<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.550> kind<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.000> mirror<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.570> that

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
the next is kind of a mirror of that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.050 
the next is kind of a mirror of that
it's<00:05:09.560> here<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.919> on<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.520> third<00:05:10.790> fret

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
it's here on the on the third fret

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.210 
it's here on the on the third fret
seconds<00:05:11.570> every<00:05:12.470> second<00:05:12.770> fret<00:05:12.890> of<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.040> third

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
seconds every second fret of the third

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:31.260 
seconds every second fret of the third
string

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270
