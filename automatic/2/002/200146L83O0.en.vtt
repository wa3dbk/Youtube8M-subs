hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:01.020> Jim<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.709> right<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.220> we're<00:00:02.370> going

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey guys Jim here right now we're going

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.970 
hey guys Jim here right now we're going
to<00:00:02.520> talk<00:00:02.820> about<00:00:03.179> water<00:00:03.629> resistance<00:00:04.440> as<00:00:04.620> it

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to talk about water resistance as it

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.249 
to talk about water resistance as it
relates<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> practical<00:00:06.299> everyday<00:00:06.450> purposes

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
relates to practical everyday purposes

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.530 
relates to practical everyday purposes
in<00:00:07.460> wristwatches<00:00:08.460> now<00:00:09.210> we're<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.480> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
in wristwatches now we're going to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
in wristwatches now we're going to
explore<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.960> couple<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.500> different<00:00:10.860> depth

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
explore a couple of different depth

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
explore a couple of different depth
readings<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> kind<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.059> talk<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.480> what

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
readings and kind of talk about what

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
readings and kind of talk about what
their<00:00:13.080> usefulness<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.580> be

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
their usefulness is really going to be

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
their usefulness is really going to be
but<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.780> general<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.590> thing<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.039> want

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
but in general the thing that you want

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
but in general the thing that you want
to<00:00:17.310> keep<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.670> mind<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> look<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to keep in mind is when you look at a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
to keep in mind is when you look at a
watch<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.260> water<00:00:19.500> resistance<00:00:20.250> rating<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
watch is water resistance rating it's a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.140 
watch is water resistance rating it's a
static<00:00:21.930> rating<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.430> other<00:00:23.580> words<00:00:23.850> let's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
static rating so in other words let's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
static rating so in other words let's
say<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.600> getting<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> watch<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
say you're getting a watch that's a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519 
say you're getting a watch that's a
hundred<00:00:26.670> meters<00:00:26.970> water<00:00:27.210> resistant<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hundred meters water resistant that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.380 
hundred meters water resistant that
means<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> literally<00:00:29.369> could<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.670> dropped<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
means it literally could be dropped on a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.569 
means it literally could be dropped on a
fishing<00:00:30.750> line<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> hundred<00:00:31.980> meters<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
fishing line down to a hundred meters of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.760 
fishing line down to a hundred meters of
depth<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.969> survive<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.809> pressures<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> are

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
depth and survive the pressures that are

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
depth and survive the pressures that are
there<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.610> moving<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
there when it's not moving now if you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
there when it's not moving now if you
were<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.469> wearing<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> watch<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
were actually wearing the watch at a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
were actually wearing the watch at a
hundred<00:00:39.059> meters<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.980> swimming<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.070> having

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
hundred meters and swimming and having

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.299 
hundred meters and swimming and having
any<00:00:41.640> activity<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.570> exerts<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.469> lot<00:00:43.920> more

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
any activity that exerts a lot more

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.160 
any activity that exerts a lot more
pressure<00:00:44.700> than<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.329> sitting<00:00:45.570> static

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
pressure than if it was sitting static

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
pressure than if it was sitting static
so<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.910> bit

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so that's going to be a little bit

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.459 
so that's going to be a little bit
different<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> hundred<00:00:48.960> meter<00:00:49.200> watch

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
different for you a hundred meter watch

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
different for you a hundred meter watch
at<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> hundred<00:00:50.219> meters<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.610> motion<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> most

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
at a hundred meters in motion is most

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.250 
at a hundred meters in motion is most
likely<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.250> survive<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.750> we're

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
likely not going to survive so we're

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
likely not going to survive so we're
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> talk<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.039> practical

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
going to talk about the practical

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.150 
going to talk about the practical
everyday<00:00:56.760> applications<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:58.469> each<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.070> these

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
everyday applications of each of these

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.580 
everyday applications of each of these
watches<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.390> we're<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> start<00:01:01.140> here

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
watches so we're going to start here

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
watches so we're going to start here
with<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.859> standard<00:01:02.609> luxury<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.510> dress<00:01:03.899> watch

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
with a standard luxury or dress watch

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.700 
with a standard luxury or dress watch
now<00:01:04.939> typically<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.270> always<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.080> typically<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
now typically not always but typically a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
now typically not always but typically a
luxury<00:01:08.220> watch<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.880> doesn't<00:01:09.299> require<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
luxury watch like this doesn't require a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
luxury watch like this doesn't require a
lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> water<00:01:10.380> resistance<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.400> don't

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
lot of water resistance so they don't

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
lot of water resistance so they don't
need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.350> looking<00:01:13.740> at

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
need to do that what we're looking at

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.210 
need to do that what we're looking at
here<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.369> five<00:01:15.240> atm<00:01:15.810> fifty<00:01:16.710> meters<00:01:16.860> water

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
here is five atm fifty meters water

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
here is five atm fifty meters water
resistance<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.030> five<00:01:18.270> atmospheres<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> going

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
resistance so five atmospheres is going

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.039 
resistance so five atmospheres is going
to<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.380> 50<00:01:19.770> meters<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.820> while<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.330> may<00:01:21.570> tell

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
to be 50 meters now while that may tell

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
to be 50 meters now while that may tell
you<00:01:22.259> oh<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.009> 50<00:01:23.490> meters<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.939> can

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you oh I can go down to 50 meters I can

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
you oh I can go down to 50 meters I can
swim<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.900> wherever<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.740> that's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
swim pretty much wherever I want that's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100 
swim pretty much wherever I want that's

moisture<00:02:33.510> inside<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.290> case<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.490> we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
moisture inside of this case now as we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.520 
moisture inside of this case now as we
see<00:02:35.880> clearly<00:02:36.210> marked<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.960> challenger

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
see clearly marked on this challenger

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.340 
see clearly marked on this challenger
this<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.990> 200<00:02:39.990> meters

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
this is going to be 200 meters

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.740 
this is going to be 200 meters
water-resistant<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.420> once

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
water-resistant and there it is once

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.120 
water-resistant and there it is once
again<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.650> case<00:02:43.860> back<00:02:44.150> 20<00:02:45.150> 80<00:02:45.330> M<00:02:46.100> 660<00:02:47.100> feet

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
again on the case back 20 80 M 660 feet
so<00:02:47.490> now<00:02:47.670> we're<00:02:47.850> doubling<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> water

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
so now we're doubling the water

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.620 
so now we're doubling the water
resistance<00:02:49.190> now<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.490> lot<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.000> things<00:02:51.270> have<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
resistance now a lot of things have to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.450 
resistance now a lot of things have to
change<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.350> order<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:52.710> able<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.950> reach<00:02:53.190> this

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
change in order to be able to reach this

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.240 
change in order to be able to reach this
degree<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> water<00:02:54.210> resistance<00:02:54.560> now<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.980> walls

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
degree of water resistance now the walls

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.210 
degree of water resistance now the walls
of<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> case<00:02:56.880> must<00:02:57.240> be<00:02:57.360> thicker<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:58.560> crystal

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
of the case must be thicker your crystal

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160 
of the case must be thicker your crystal
no<00:02:59.370> matter<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.730> material<00:02:59.850> must<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.780> thicker

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
no matter the material must be thicker

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.740 
no matter the material must be thicker
and<00:03:01.440> your<00:03:02.130> case<00:03:02.490> back<00:03:02.850> must<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.330> thicker

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
and your case back must be a thicker

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.440 
and your case back must be a thicker
reinforced<00:03:04.740> case<00:03:04.950> back<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.430> well<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.360> to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
reinforced case back as well so to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.990 
reinforced case back as well so to
achieve<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.990> 200<00:03:07.560> meters<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> will<00:03:08.370> cost<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
achieve that 200 meters it will cost a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.910 
achieve that 200 meters it will cost a
lot<00:03:09.180> more<00:03:09.240> money<00:03:09.480> you're<00:03:10.350> also<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.770> be

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
lot more money you're also going to be

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
lot more money you're also going to be
adding<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.280> different<00:03:11.490> set<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.000> gaskets<00:03:12.690> in

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
now that is extreme 3,300 feet now

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.229 
now that is extreme 3,300 feet now
obviously<00:03:46.620> we've<00:03:46.830> already<00:03:47.070> talked<00:03:47.489> about<00:03:47.610> 200

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
obviously we've already talked about 200

obviously we've already talked about 200
meters<00:03:48.480> being<00:03:48.690> more<00:03:49.650> than<00:03:49.920> most<00:03:50.280> people<00:03:50.640> will

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760

ever<00:03:50.820> need<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:52.050> goes<00:03:52.350> beyond<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.280> is

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
ever need this goes beyond that this is

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.400 
ever need this goes beyond that this is
an<00:03:53.610> extreme<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.750> reason<00:03:55.140> why<00:03:55.260> they're

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
an extreme and the reason why they're

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.660 
an extreme and the reason why they're
able<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.680> do<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.340> you'll<00:03:56.430> see<00:03:56.580> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
able to do that is and you'll see the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.390 
able to do that is and you'll see the
watch<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.060> much<00:03:57.420> thicker<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.500> sidewalls<00:03:59.160> of

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
watch is much thicker the sidewalls of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.490 
watch is much thicker the sidewalls of
the<00:03:59.489> case<00:03:59.700> are<00:03:59.940> tremendously<00:04:00.810> thicker<00:04:01.230> so

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the case are tremendously thicker so

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.050 
the case are tremendously thicker so
they<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:01.800> withstand<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.310> pressure<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.000> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
they can withstand the pressure so it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.580 
they can withstand the pressure so it
won't<00:04:03.270> get<00:04:03.420> crushed<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> tin<00:04:04.290> can

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
won't get crushed like a tin can

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.220 
won't get crushed like a tin can
when<00:04:05.340> they're<00:04:05.489> being<00:04:05.700> tested<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.720> factory

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
when they're being tested in the factory
