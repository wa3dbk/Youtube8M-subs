00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:38.619 
and just like magnifies it I'm going to

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.679 
and just like magnifies it I'm going to
look<00:05:38.709> as<00:05:39.699> well<00:05:39.909> yeah<00:05:40.240> let's<00:05:41.169> go<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.349> Sabo<00:05:42.689> get

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
look as well yeah let's go to Sabo get

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.709 
look as well yeah let's go to Sabo get
back<00:05:43.899> out<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.759> picture<00:05:45.759> mode<00:05:45.969> we're

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
back out of that picture mode we're

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:47.969 
back out of that picture mode we're
going<00:05:46.839> to<00:05:46.899> calibrate<00:05:47.409> that<00:05:47.649> later

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
going to calibrate that later

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.379 
going to calibrate that later
using<00:05:48.459> up<00:05:48.639> HD<00:05:49.449> pictures<00:05:49.809> I<00:05:50.050> have<00:05:51.059> and<00:05:52.059> decide

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
using up HD pictures I have and decide

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.489 
using up HD pictures I have and decide
you<00:05:52.509> software<00:05:52.899> updates<00:05:53.259> through<00:05:53.649> info<00:05:54.300> enter

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:55.499 
you software updates through info enter

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.499 
you software updates through info enter
does<00:05:56.499> art<00:05:56.709> updates<00:05:57.279> itself<00:05:57.580> automatically<00:05:58.330> so

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
does art updates itself automatically so

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.340 
does art updates itself automatically so
you<00:05:58.539> have<00:05:58.719> to<00:05:58.779> worry<00:05:58.929> about<00:05:58.959> that

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.710 

and<00:06:03.910> this<00:06:04.910> is<00:06:05.030> already<00:06:05.360> three<00:06:05.600> setup<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:08.660> you

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
and this is already three setup so you

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.030 
and this is already three setup so you
don't<00:06:08.900> wanna<00:06:09.020> mess<00:06:09.140> with<00:06:09.320> these<00:06:09.440> settings<00:06:09.710> too

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
don't wanna mess with these settings too

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.580 
don't wanna mess with these settings too
much<00:06:10.360> here's<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.450> 3d<00:06:11.840> test<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.230> make<00:06:12.380> sure<00:06:12.500> that

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
much here's a 3d test to make sure that

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.700 
much here's a 3d test to make sure that
the<00:06:12.680> 3ds<00:06:13.010> working<00:06:13.460> so<00:06:13.850> click<00:06:14.150> on<00:06:14.300> that<00:06:14.710> and

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
the 3ds working so click on that and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.270 
the 3ds working so click on that and
click<00:06:16.510> on<00:06:17.510> start<00:06:18.170> and<00:06:18.740> we're<00:06:18.890> going<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.040> test

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
click on start and we're going to test

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.580 
click on start and we're going to test
the<00:06:19.400> 3d<00:06:19.790> glasses<00:06:20.060> right<00:06:20.420> now<00:06:23.350> so<00:06:24.350> you<00:06:24.440> make

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
the 3d glasses right now so you make

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.040 
the 3d glasses right now so you make
sure<00:06:24.830> your<00:06:25.070> glasses<00:06:25.640> are<00:06:25.940> charged<00:06:26.390> when<00:06:26.930> you

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
sure your glasses are charged when you

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.170 
sure your glasses are charged when you
turn<00:06:27.350> on<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.530> switch<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:28.100> 3d<00:06:28.370> mode<00:06:28.610> hit<00:06:28.820> up<00:06:29.000> all

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
turn on the switch to 3d mode hit up all

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
turn on the switch to 3d mode hit up all
the<00:06:29.420> way<00:06:29.540> and<00:06:29.840> you'll<00:06:30.110> see<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.380> light<00:06:30.560> blink

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
the way and you'll see the light blink

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.290 
the way and you'll see the light blink
all<00:06:33.200> right<00:06:33.410> so<00:06:33.740> it<00:06:33.950> should<00:06:34.190> be<00:06:34.730> in<00:06:34.820> 3d<00:06:35.270> right

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
all right so it should be in 3d right

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:42.820 
all right so it should be in 3d right
now<00:06:40.720> maybe<00:06:41.720> the<00:06:41.900> batteries<00:06:42.260> are<00:06:42.410> dead<00:06:42.530> I<00:06:42.590> might

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
now maybe the batteries are dead I might

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.770 
now maybe the batteries are dead I might
have<00:06:42.920> to<00:06:43.040> grab<00:06:43.160> the<00:06:43.400> other<00:06:43.460> glass<00:06:43.730> all<00:06:44.510> right

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
have to grab the other glass all right

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.990 
have to grab the other glass all right
let's<00:06:45.080> see<00:06:45.320> if<00:06:45.410> the<00:06:45.500> 3d<00:06:45.830> power<00:06:46.430> on<00:06:46.580> the<00:06:46.700> 3d

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
let's see if the 3d power on the 3d

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.820 
let's see if the 3d power on the 3d
glasses<00:06:47.230> let's<00:06:48.230> go<00:06:48.380> ahead<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:48.650> hit<00:06:48.740> the

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
glasses let's go ahead and hit the

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.570 
glasses let's go ahead and hit the
switch<00:06:49.100> on<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:50.290> light<00:06:51.290> turns<00:06:52.040> on<00:06:52.220> when<00:06:52.490> you

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
switch on the light turns on when you

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.310 
switch on the light turns on when you
turn<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.880> switch<00:06:53.000> on<00:06:53.270> so<00:06:53.540> you<00:06:54.080> know<00:06:54.110> the

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
turn the switch on so you know the

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.020 
turn the switch on so you know the
battery<00:06:54.470> is<00:06:54.650> good<00:06:54.860> so<00:06:55.580> let's<00:06:55.700> go<00:06:55.790> ahead<00:06:55.910> and

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
battery is good so let's go ahead and

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:05.110 
battery is good so let's go ahead and
put<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:59.290> yeah<00:07:00.730> so<00:07:01.730> it<00:07:01.820> merges<00:07:02.150> it<00:07:03.760> yeah<00:07:04.760> so

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
put that yeah so it merges it yeah so

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.810 
put that yeah so it merges it yeah so
that's<00:07:05.390> definitely<00:07:05.750> working<00:07:06.350> the<00:07:06.440> 3d<00:07:06.890> all

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
that's definitely working the 3d all

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.950 
that's definitely working the 3d all
right<00:07:08.030> so<00:07:08.180> let's<00:07:08.330> go<00:07:08.450> ahead<00:07:08.540> and<00:07:08.720> turn<00:07:08.810> it<00:07:08.840> back

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
right so let's go ahead and turn it back

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.580 
right so let's go ahead and turn it back
off<00:07:09.260> just<00:07:09.710> hit<00:07:09.890> the<00:07:09.980> switch

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
off just hit the switch

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.130 
off just hit the switch
oh<00:07:12.590> yeah<00:07:12.920> absolutely<00:07:13.010> no<00:07:13.460> problem<00:07:13.760> so<00:07:14.510> yet<00:07:14.960> if

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
oh yeah absolutely no problem so yet if

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.530 
oh yeah absolutely no problem so yet if
that<00:07:15.170> green<00:07:15.530> light<00:07:15.710> is<00:07:15.830> on<00:07:16.040> that<00:07:16.430> means<00:07:16.610> 3d

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
that green light is on that means 3d

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.300 
that green light is on that means 3d
glasses<00:07:17.720> are<00:07:18.020> on<00:07:18.140> their<00:07:19.100> own

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
glasses are on their own

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.310 
glasses are on their own
Willard<00:07:19.760> all<00:07:20.600> right<00:07:20.720> so<00:07:20.840> now<00:07:20.960> we're<00:07:21.110> going<00:07:21.230> to

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
Willard all right so now we're going to

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.930 
Willard all right so now we're going to
calibrate<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:21.890> picture<00:07:22.400> so<00:07:22.580> it<00:07:22.670> looks<00:07:22.880> a

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
calibrate the picture so it looks a

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.460 
calibrate the picture so it looks a
little<00:07:23.000> bit<00:07:23.180> better<00:07:23.330> right<00:07:23.600> now<00:07:24.200> it<00:07:24.320> looks

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
little bit better right now it looks

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.500 
little bit better right now it looks
good<00:07:24.850> but<00:07:25.850> I'm<00:07:25.970> worried<00:07:26.120> we're<00:07:26.300> going<00:07:26.420> to

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
good but I'm worried we're going to

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.620 
good but I'm worried we're going to
tweak<00:07:26.750> it<00:07:26.920> all<00:07:27.920> right<00:07:28.160> so<00:07:28.400> I'm<00:07:29.240> going<00:07:29.540> ahead

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
tweak it all right so I'm going ahead

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.870 
tweak it all right so I'm going ahead
and<00:07:29.780> plugged<00:07:30.140> in<00:07:31.180> the<00:07:32.180> calibration
