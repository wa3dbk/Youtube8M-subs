00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.899 
people who want to watch battlefield I
think<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.860> mechanics<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.220> game<00:01:26.580> like

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
think the mechanics of this game like

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
think the mechanics of this game like
the<00:01:27.090> movement<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.080> everything<00:01:28.590> about

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the movement I think everything about

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.390 
the movement I think everything about
this<00:01:29.250> game<00:01:29.479> battlefield<00:01:30.479> 4<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.229> hardline<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this game battlefield 4 and hardline is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.149 
this game battlefield 4 and hardline is
like<00:01:32.700> super<00:01:33.390> perfect<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.990> thought<00:01:34.159> battlefield

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
like super perfect I thought battlefield

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.440 
like super perfect I thought battlefield
3<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:37.229> plug<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.579> little<00:01:38.970> clunky

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
3 was a little plug just a little clunky

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
3 was a little plug just a little clunky
you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.220> prone

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
you know like when you get up from prone

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
you know like when you get up from prone
you<00:01:41.850> got<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.479> pause<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.350> clunky

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you got this little pause this clunky

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
you got this little pause this clunky
pause<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.600> stuff<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
pause and then you know stuff like that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.039 
pause and then you know stuff like that
but<00:01:46.799> battlefield<00:01:47.460> 3<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.000> could<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.780> then

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
but battlefield 3 you could you then

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.969 
but battlefield 3 you could you then
have<00:01:49.460> more<00:01:50.460> freedom<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have more freedom if if you if this

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.800 
have more freedom if if you if this
makes<00:01:53.189> sense<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:54.090> jump<00:01:54.450> shoot

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
makes sense like you could jump shoot

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.170 
makes sense like you could jump shoot
and<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> could<00:01:55.530> drop<00:01:55.829> shot<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and you could drop shot but it was

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.050 
and you could drop shot but it was
sloppy<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> jump<00:01:58.950> shot<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.520> your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
sloppy like like you jump shot you your

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
sloppy like like you jump shot you your
jump<00:02:00.360> shot<00:02:00.390> wouldn't<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.229> black<00:02:01.500> ops<00:02:01.740> 2

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
jump shot wouldn't be like black ops 2

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.530 
jump shot wouldn't be like black ops 2
like<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.670> point<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.200> crazy

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
like on point it would be like crazy

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.930 
like on point it would be like crazy
spraying<00:02:06.540> all<00:02:06.869> over<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.500> place<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.009> at<00:02:08.489> least

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
spraying all over the place but at least

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.820 
spraying all over the place but at least

warfare two and goes time to kill is
fast<00:02:54.280> i<00:02:54.490> think<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.850> worked<00:02:55.090> with<00:02:55.330> those<00:02:55.510> games

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
fast i think it worked with those games

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.640 
fast i think it worked with those games
because<00:02:56.380> call<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.610> duty<00:02:58.150> only<00:02:58.630> has<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.080> maximum

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
because call of duty only has a maximum

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.490 
because call of duty only has a maximum

of nine people you know I don't like the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.530 
of nine people you know I don't like the
time<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.920> kill<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.190> hardline<00:03:04.060> because

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
time to kill and hardline because

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.550
