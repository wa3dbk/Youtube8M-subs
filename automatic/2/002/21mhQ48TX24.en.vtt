00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 on the beam of good balance 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
 luck for the Brazilian and the note to be 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 Romanian hit when Diana circumvents 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.250
 marx 14 650 already in corner and won the race 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.529
 of heels on the table 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.529
 returning to international competitions 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.340
 in the overall classification of jade barbosa 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:36.590
 stayed with the third note 14 225 is that it is 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.410
 a very good note already has this new 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.210
 code is a difficult device as is the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.820
 balance beam is a wall of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.480
 much precision any little rocker 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.629
 any slip the athlete may suffer 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.720
 a fall in the odds of making a mistake 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.239
 in this device are very large in 1487 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.020
 final note of the Latvian gymnasium avoid 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.719
 Excavations make it a difficult entry 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.229
 which is a deadly round layout up 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.570
 of the device now comes a sequence 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 chromatic with deadly dada layout hit 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.520
 It's good that the gymnast already 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.009
 firmly right there gives confidence to follow 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.009
 rest of the series can not miss nonsense 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.209
 there a very difficult dance jump has 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.670
 a very high difficulty value 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.140
 in this turn she tried to keep her leg 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.770
 on the horizontal 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.420
 but habits should not consider the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.640
 with a very 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.369
 good 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.770
 I did not like to travel, stop talking to me. 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.979
 adapt to the new code is very difficult 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.860
 practically an athlete can not stop too much 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.319
 before stunts to focus 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.240
 and I see that jade is 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:03.370
 adapting very well these new rules 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.300
 look what beauty and dance sequence well 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.430
 Then you see it in the rhythm of 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.410
 already a more dynamic rhythm, let's 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.410
 see now at the exit can not stand still 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.070
 There's plenty of time for you soon. 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.920
 acrobatics county flack also leaves 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.940
 double deadly beautiful 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 jade was able to reproduce exactly 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.250
 because she does in training the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 imbalances were small 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.750
 she is facing opponents of 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 level as - the Olympic vice champions 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.970
 You see there at the entrance she has a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.790
 high difficulty at entry because of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.280
 her chance to make a mistake is greater 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.020
 She managed to be alone in America. 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.330
 greatest imbalance she had been in the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.590
 the rest of the stunts 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.750
 passed very well 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.010
 Look at her entrance, it's difficult for her. 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010
 between on your back
