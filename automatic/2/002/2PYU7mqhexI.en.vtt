00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.520
 this morning to see the chateau rover series 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.500
 what's the font 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.480
 % levorate presented hair for silver sky sport shoes 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.399
 the application can easily download the peticiÃ³n store 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.609
 is launched in this world here 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.570
 directly patch a search that integrates all the search services of 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:27.380
 Google 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.159
 therefore very transversal 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.199
 in which opposition immediately seek I do not know how to search pizap 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.150
 the interesting thing about typing him gives me this axis here 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.630
 which drags away 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.020
 to 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.880
 you gave me 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.710
 of tag suggestions 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.850
 that I can safely 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.980
 move flowing 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.510
 vertically 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.180
 instead I have a list of people found places found 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 little hearts from previous salts 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
 if I say for example, continue writing pizap 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 I select okay and pizza what I want him to complete 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.620
 the research is what is interesting that would tell me then weapons weapons 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.550
 functioning georeferenced 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.870
 suggests me 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.380
 oh well you don't find people because a person marked with pizap 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 suggests me sites suggests 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.840
 in previous searches 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.290
 once I say okay it harrows what I want then search pizzoni rmit 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.320
 it opens up directly to me 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.310
 Google Maps 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 the bottom of me and then you tell me are the pizzerias around me 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.990
 yes to me instead 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 back to the application 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.910
 launched abysses 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910
 pizza slice as a normal search 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.900
 petretto appeared the personalized google page in the sense that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.630
 pizap proposes me your first result mapro also to give me local was 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.620
 Myrmica 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.670
 around me 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 and also directly to the addresses connect chan to call 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 eventually go directly to the pizzeria 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.049
 its interesting part is part of the Arabic search to be there 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.419
 so if I speak English I can play with the mouse 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.169
 here to understand my site percassi too far 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.169
 prodi base if I do 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.119
 looking for work in my voice 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.779
 find colored pizap 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.839
 therefore it is literally possible to search for small orders 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:54.669
 English 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.079
 in a very very simple way 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.349
 and if with direct access 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.019
 the propic actions 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.879
 me all google apps 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.879
 It is also possible in the settings 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.659
 set up your own custom domain for the company so that 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.479
 here I met directly 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.059
 primocanale specifically sky cinema 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.689
 and other documents 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.249
 you know if it is interesting because in fact it is a very good fruit for the heading not 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.189
 will put us in that maps 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.889
 all the information that can be recovered on the aifon impiety capacity 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.539
 of the devais to listen and reproduce 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.069
 so it's a great example of 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.509
 structured web application that 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.679
 pos porro serve 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.539
 da ba dee per apro for irrigation was for internet losses through the 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.919
