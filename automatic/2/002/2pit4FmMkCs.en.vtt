00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.060 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.280 

now<00:00:15.060> question<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.720> from<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.200> you

now question I get from a lot of you
guys<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.830> what's<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> difference<00:00:17.610> between

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
guys is what's the difference between

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.000 
guys is what's the difference between
water<00:00:18.210> filtration<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:19.110> water<00:00:19.500> purification

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
water filtration and water purification

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.210 
water filtration and water purification
water<00:00:20.850> filtration<00:00:21.210> works<00:00:21.750> by<00:00:22.410> filtering<00:00:22.950> out

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
water filtration works by filtering out

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.150 
water filtration works by filtering out
particles<00:00:23.760> water<00:00:24.600> purification<00:00:25.170> works<00:00:25.890> by

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
particles water purification works by

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.090 
particles water purification works by
killing<00:00:26.760> disease<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.630> bacteria<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.830> really

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
killing disease and bacteria so really

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.710 
killing disease and bacteria so really
you<00:00:29.190> want<00:00:29.370> to<00:00:29.430> utilize<00:00:29.580> both<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.450> can

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you want to utilize both if you can

just grab some water now that I got my

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
just grab some water now that I got my
water<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> glass<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.510> push

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
water here in the glass I want to push

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
water here in the glass I want to push
the<00:01:33.659> button<00:01:34.020> once<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> leader<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:34.979> twice

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the button once for a leader or twice

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.490 
the button once for a leader or twice
for<00:01:35.670> half<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> liter<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.540> light<00:01:36.750> won't<00:01:37.020> cut<00:01:37.320> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
for half a liter the light won't cut on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.890 
for half a liter the light won't cut on
until<00:01:38.250> both<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:39.119> sensors<00:01:39.630> are

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
until both of these sensors are

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
until both of these sensors are
submerged<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> water<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.670> whenever<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
submerged into the water so whenever it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
submerged into the water so whenever it
flashes<00:01:42.509> green<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> submerge
