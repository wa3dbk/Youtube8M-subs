hello today I'm going to be showing you
how<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.790> make<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:10.790> alpha<00:00:11.790> texture<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.480> GIMP<00:00:12.809> and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
how to make a alpha texture in GIMP and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.960 
how to make a alpha texture in GIMP and
then<00:00:14.670> apply<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:17.539> plane<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> blender

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
then apply it to a plane in the blender

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
then apply it to a plane in the blender
game<00:00:21.359> engine<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:25.039> we<00:00:26.039> need<00:00:26.160> our<00:00:26.310> alpha

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
game engine so first we need our alpha

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
game engine so first we need our alpha
texture<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.599> open<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:27.900> GIMP<00:00:31.070> click<00:00:32.070> new<00:00:32.520> then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
texture so open up GIMP click new then

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
texture so open up GIMP click new then
just<00:00:33.870> make<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.260> 512<00:00:35.100> by<00:00:35.370> 512<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.450> then

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
just make it 512 by 512 and then

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.639 
just make it 512 by 512 and then
advanced<00:00:37.649> options<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.350> background<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
advanced options make it background and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
advanced options make it background and
a<00:00:41.690> um<00:00:43.340> transparency<00:00:44.340> transparency<00:00:46.010> um<00:00:47.870> click

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a um transparency transparency um click

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
a um transparency transparency um click
OK<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> you'll<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:52.309> then<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.600> doesn't

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
OK and you'll get this then just doesn't

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150 
OK and you'll get this then just doesn't
really<00:00:54.750> matter<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> show

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
really matter what it is just to show

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.110 
really matter what it is just to show
you<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:57.199> make<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.000> apply<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.420> just

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
you how to make one and apply it so just

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.310 
you how to make one and apply it so just
grab<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> tools<00:01:04.040> whichever<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.159> you

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
grab one of the tools whichever one you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
grab one of the tools whichever one you
want<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> use<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.430> create<00:01:11.479> something<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
want to use and create something that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.810 
want to use and create something that
will<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:14.150> which<00:01:15.150> cell<00:01:15.479> work<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> fine<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
will work which cell work is fine and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:31.000 
will work which cell work is fine and
now<00:01:17.869> save<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.159> as<00:01:25.100> let's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:49.300 

I'll<00:01:31.910> save<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.180> as<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:33.220> PNG<00:01:34.220> file<00:01:47.830> click<00:01:48.830> hits<00:01:49.070> it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
I'll save it as a PNG file click hits it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.720 
I'll save it as a PNG file click hits it
it's<00:01:49.880> safe<00:01:50.180> ok<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:52.120> close<00:01:53.120> that<00:01:54.550> now<00:01:55.550> in

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
it's safe ok and close that now in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's safe ok and close that now in
blender<00:01:56.590> delete<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> default<00:01:58.220> cube<00:01:59.260> add<00:02:00.260> a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
blender delete to the default cube add a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.030 
blender delete to the default cube add a
plane<00:02:02.740> go<00:02:03.740> into<00:02:04.100> shading<00:02:05.440> Adam<00:02:06.440> material

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
plane go into shading Adam material

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.740 
plane go into shading Adam material
don't<00:02:07.910> really<00:02:08.090> have<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.270> name<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> at<00:02:08.660> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
don't really have to name it at the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.230 
don't really have to name it at the

shadeless<00:03:12.340> um<00:03:16.570> now<00:03:17.570> you've<00:03:17.720> got<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.519> what<00:03:19.519> looks

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
shadeless um now you've got a what looks

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.400 
shadeless um now you've got a what looks
transparent<00:03:21.550> plane<00:03:22.550> or<00:03:23.000> what<00:03:23.570> looks<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
transparent plane or what looks like a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.980 
transparent plane or what looks like a
squiggle<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.300> really<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.900> plain

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
squiggle but is really just a plain

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:39.630 
squiggle but is really just a plain
which<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:31.270> texture<00:03:31.810> made<00:03:32.080> transparent<00:03:38.640> so

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
which the texture made transparent so

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.430 
which the texture made transparent so
you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:40.090> use<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:43.230> lots<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.380> different

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
you can use this for lots of different

you can use this for lots of different
things<00:03:44.850> um<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.930> make<00:03:50.110> a<00:03:50.140> wiggly<00:03:50.850> spirelings

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
things um to make a wiggly spirelings

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.120 
things um to make a wiggly spirelings
google<00:03:52.240> for<00:03:52.450> instance<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.680> could<00:03:53.830> be<00:03:53.950> pretty

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
google for instance it could be pretty

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.790 
google for instance it could be pretty
worthless<00:03:54.460> but<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.870> needed<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.320> or<00:04:00.240> of<00:04:01.800> our

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
worthless but if you needed it or of our

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.530 
worthless but if you needed it or of our
example<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.370> could<00:04:03.490> use<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.090> make

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
example you could use it to make

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.520 
example you could use it to make
something<00:04:05.440> such<00:04:05.920> as<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.870> all<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.140> these<00:04:08.320> are

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
something such as this all of these are

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:19.590 
something such as this all of these are
all<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:09.660> alpha<00:04:10.660> textured<00:04:11.050> planes<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.640> so

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
all just alpha textured planes so so

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.040 
all just alpha textured planes so so
there<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:20.470> how<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:20.860> it<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:23.320> think<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:24.430> it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
there is how you do it I think that's it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.320 
there is how you do it I think that's it
and<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.130> have<00:04:27.220> any<00:04:27.430> questions<00:04:27.880> post<00:04:28.120> a
