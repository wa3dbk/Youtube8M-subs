00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to see without the particles but they

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.999 
to see without the particles but they
did<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.689> take<00:01:51.899> damage<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.470> let<00:01:52.710> me<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.950> show

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
did all take damage now let me just show

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
did all take damage now let me just show
you<00:01:53.159> how<00:01:53.340> quickly<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.820> stack<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.180> up

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you how quickly you can stack it up

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
you how quickly you can stack it up
walking<00:01:54.570> around<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.290> opinion<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
walking around in my opinion this is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
walking around in my opinion this is
pretty<00:01:56.280> damn<00:01:56.549> quickly<00:01:56.880> stacking<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.570> as

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
pretty damn quickly stacking it up as

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
pretty damn quickly stacking it up as
you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.110> we're<00:01:58.469> already<00:01:58.680> half<00:01:58.979> way<00:01:59.219> then

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you can see we're already half way then

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
you can see we're already half way then
the<00:01:59.790> other<00:01:59.909> way<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> stack<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> by<00:02:00.960> using

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the other way to stack it up is by using

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
the other way to stack it up is by using
your<00:02:01.380> abilities<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.979> example<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.460> put<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> Q

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
your abilities for example I put a Q

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.080 
your abilities for example I put a Q
down<00:02:03.210> BAM<00:02:03.780> jumps<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.380> 90<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.790> an

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
down BAM jumps up to 90 and if I do an

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.020 
down BAM jumps up to 90 and if I do an
email<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> gonna<00:02:07.320> take<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.829> over<00:02:08.069> 90<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
email this is gonna take it over 90 to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.110 
email this is gonna take it over 90 to
100<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.629> might<00:02:09.959> even<00:02:10.200> activate<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
100 and might even activate it so

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.330 
100 and might even activate it so
takes<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.349> hundred<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.890> activates

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
takes it up to a hundred and activates

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.030 
takes it up to a hundred and activates
it<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.540> are<00:02:14.720> at<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.019> for<00:02:15.200> example<00:02:15.260> 99

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
it so if you are at like for example 99

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.009 
it so if you are at like for example 99
stacks<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.670> 100<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.510> use<00:02:17.690> an<00:02:17.840> ability

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
stacks out of 100 and you use an ability

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.050 
stacks out of 100 and you use an ability
as<00:02:18.379> long<00:02:18.860> as<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.129> puts<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.489> over<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.849> top<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
as long as it puts it over the top of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.180 
as long as it puts it over the top of
100<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> will<00:02:20.870> activate<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.560> let<00:02:21.890> me<00:02:21.980> show<00:02:22.129> you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
100 it will activate it let me show you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.740 
100 it will activate it let me show you
how<00:02:22.370> quickly<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.879> stack<00:02:23.150> up<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.480> by<00:02:23.599> using

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
how quickly can stack up just by using

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.229 
how quickly can stack up just by using
two<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.170> W<00:02:24.560> there<00:02:24.980> we<00:02:25.069> go<00:02:25.190> that's<00:02:25.400> at<00:02:25.550> 40<00:02:25.879> then

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
two in W there we go that's at 40 then

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.300 
two in W there we go that's at 40 then
as<00:02:26.450> cassiopeia<00:02:27.170> obviously<00:02:27.590> spamming<00:02:28.099> we're

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
how much damage we end up doing to the

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.309 
how much damage we end up doing to the
rest<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:55.220> them<00:02:55.370> here<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.849> go<00:02:56.030> ban<00:02:56.329> applied<00:02:57.019> and

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
rest of them here we go ban applied and

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.130 
rest of them here we go ban applied and
let's<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:57.890> stacking<00:02:58.400> up<00:02:58.489> 20<00:02:58.849> 40<00:02:59.329> 60<00:02:59.360> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
let's see it's stacking up 20 40 60 and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.809 
let's see it's stacking up 20 40 60 and
as<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:00.950> stacks<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.579> really

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
as you can see it just stacks up really

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.720 
as you can see it just stacks up really
a<00:03:01.849> hundred<00:03:02.390> again<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.680> stacks<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.129> quite<00:03:04.400> fast

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
a hundred again it stacks up quite fast
