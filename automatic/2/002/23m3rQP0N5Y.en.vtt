00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.060
 I like javier very much the mathematics of small my mother my mother loves the 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.929
 Mathematics in Soria Mice with the Issue Problem 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.479
 with 4 13 years old and they gave me a book where there was a problem 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.680
 ma mathematical that what that outcome of the institute 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 the institute just do account and others and the book was more works of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.990
 demonstration and others I liked very much the way of expressing and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.880
 and it will make it very easy very simple instalmat essential well solving 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 problems 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.860
 benjamin is an atypical case 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.630
 since mathematics happens to be one of the subjects traditionally 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.590
 rougher of middle grade education 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.180
 face a tangle of numbers and formulas without knowing many times their 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.910
 Possible utility or applications has been one of the main causes of 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.290
 hostility raised by this matter 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.880
 because who studied mathematics today 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.400
 however, the world of mathematics goes far beyond making 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.730
 accounts, which makes it one of the degrees with the lowest rate of 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.660
 unemployment 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.550
 listeners and we will approach the true face of this complex science that 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.490
 it seems like one of the races with more future projection of the panorama 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 academic 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200
 certainly the mathematics 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.350
 they are not special they are special because first because 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.840
 of the first year that starts 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.210
 they demand because he has to think 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.820
 that each area thinks that matsui before is not accustomed itself to the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.400
 snow report in winter and title did not cover took press 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 the language that mathematics uses the form of fame the way to attract that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.900
 species 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.060
 you need to have 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 true juan angel cappa 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.669
 but all these things 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.239
 by groups the mathematics in the baccalaureate 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.849
 but more as he teaches children to do matrix calculation of other works 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.969
 of the stretch of ride neptune center of change of the account the demonstration 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.549
 felling 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.129
 the life of 3.7 billion pesos 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.510
 from the left of the east 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.219
 about 30 or 40 percent of martha marine graduates 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.449
 are by paola think about the title 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.089
 what the teaching does the fundamental part 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.319
 And if it's easy, I've felt that Cuba should never finish the race 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.779
 in any way 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.589
 he prepares his own medium 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.929
 for example in a professor of the institute salk of mathematics are retiring 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.599
 the number of retirements press may 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.589
 right now it is greater than the number of enrolled 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.199
 owes to that the mathematics degree bundesliga clubs 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.889
 sport that says that this is a way out 10 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.019
 linda mike hogan and alexia king 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.019
 lima jun 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:09.979
 this couple 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:14.189
 my job is to look for activity called expertise to get others out 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.580
 you for me who are attracted 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.879
 the student ends the attention 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.859
 and in the anteroom in another way so that the parliamentary math remit me 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.859
 subject but it's not the good thing is that we have although he refused 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.149
 spent they will lodge at point-blank range 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.409
 one day that logical justice is done or propose another type of activities that 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.229
 the population at min 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.229
 that somebody denied him math 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.519
 on the other side of the river 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.209
 Furthermore, it is necessary to count on the fact that of the approximately 900 students 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.370
 matriculan annually math half that five years ago a third of 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.930
 they finish the race whose duration ranges between 6 and 7 years 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.279
 90% of those who end up graduating optics in a job 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.279
 stable in a period of between two and three years 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.059
 but in addition to teaching and given that today's society is very based on 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.379
 technology the job spectrum of a degree such as mathematics 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.539
 covers areas such as information technology banking, banking 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.659
 even medicine 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.129
 but hey what will start working with forms said 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.379
 Caesar is winning the way of programming is getting worse in 1 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:25.349
 language 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.439
 it is very different from the language 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.120
 the one who is used to his way of working 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.879
 and it will be very difficult to change 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.409
 to be able to test in that language then 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.279
 they preferred 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.319
 have someone who does not overcome by stealing 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.409
 In nothing 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.699
 for that sometimes one does not go down 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.699
 and over bonuses the mathematicians of Moscow are supposed to 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:52.389
 way of analyzing things what else does that even saved more capable of 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.759
 beat and that it ended a cycle of me I felt very ugly simple 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.810
 you have the interim the one that gives dalt that sends and I know what are ways 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.529
 is worth the analytical mind and the capacity for organization and abstraction 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.199
 are some of the peculiar characteristics that make 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.569
 mathematicians very valuable workers in the most disparate fields 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.120
 is the case of Miguel Angel who after a year as a teacher of mathematics in 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120
 a private school decided to leave his job and start his own company 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.159
 a human resources consultant 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:21.030
 tony enchanted 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.080
 the good thing about two science careers 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.150
 this is enough in 2005 referendum and they are already stingy in the five years of the 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.930
 career 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.419
 natural gas so difficult and said I'm happy home 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.699
 who can not rehearse what we want a slip could say that the 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.430
 application 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.830
 first mental quickness us to none of my functions is much 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.740
 negotiate with clients as it is with personal 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.080
 I passed the mental speed that gives us a career in sciences like mathematics 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.409
 others do with clients so innocent 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.960
 I recently lost defeat I found a mathematician in a notary 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.569
 working notary not choosing the trustworthy note person comes and emollient 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.669
 alone not normal that munch in a tunnel that that confidence were jurist a 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.779
 person of law were not mathematical 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:08.049
 how he worked and how he responds to fame as in the situation 

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:12.360
 current that raises n another of the departures that has changed with respect to the last 

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:13.099
 years 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.550
 that's what he referred to the investigation 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.979
 Spain now occupies the eighth or ninth place in the international ranking of 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.590
 countries in the field of mathematical research competing with powers of 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.410
 the size of the united states and germany in this context the university of granada 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.880
 is one of the most outstanding at national level and will constitute one of the 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.110
 four venues of the future Spanish institute of mathematics something of a lot 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.360
 close distance the destruction of faith for him much more money for 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.309
 investigation 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.190
 for beteta 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.450
 for research group research projects 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.830
 go abroad 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.319
 then there is a list and it is now in demand 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.500
 entitled within mathematics student 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.749
 to conduct research 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:52.569
 and that soda packs of twenty years did not exist 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.960
 and jewelry that if you ask and fines occupied the student 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.699
 one to one for every centimeter 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.219
 hobbs 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.910
 I do not know if the generalitat 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.720
 the news agency, whatever it is, indicated that if required
