the<00:06:12.590> reason<00:06:12.800> why<00:06:12.890> it's<00:06:13.040> not<00:06:13.130> in<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:14.020> xbox<00:06:15.020> cases

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
the reason why it's not in a xbox cases

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.290 
the reason why it's not in a xbox cases
because<00:06:15.770> that<00:06:15.890> ball<00:06:16.010> game<00:06:16.220> stop<00:06:16.460> at<00:06:16.640> but<00:06:16.850> just

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
because that ball game stop at but just

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.840 
because that ball game stop at but just
to<00:06:17.390> make<00:06:17.510> sure<00:06:17.540> it<00:06:17.810> is<00:06:17.870> ninja<00:06:18.320> gaiden<00:06:18.620> two<00:06:18.950> yeah

like<00:06:21.800> seventeen<00:06:22.370> dollars<00:06:22.520> when<00:06:23.000> it<00:06:23.090> just<00:06:23.240> came
