efficient to just buy gear off there

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
efficient to just buy gear off there
than<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> try<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.700> farm<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.150> yourself<00:01:09.570> which

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
than to try and farm for yourself which

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
than to try and farm for yourself which
is<00:01:10.850> I'm<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> say<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.390> silly<00:01:12.689> because

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is I'm not going to say it silly because

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
is I'm not going to say it silly because
that's<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.619> ya<00:01:13.890> blow<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.280> always<00:01:14.580> been<00:01:14.760> but

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that's what ya blow has always been but

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080 
that's what ya blow has always been but

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I think it could have been done a little

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
I think it could have been done a little
bit<00:01:18.360> better<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:19.220> blizzard's<00:01:20.220> end<00:01:21.590> but<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bit better on blizzard's end but like I

to<00:02:27.960> try<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.170> spec<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.770> lot<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.040> fun<00:02:29.280> it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
to try the spec it is a lot of fun it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.020 
to try the spec it is a lot of fun it's
it's<00:02:30.410> cheaper<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.440> gear<00:02:31.950> except<00:02:32.760> for<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's cheaper to gear except for the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.320 
it's cheaper to gear except for the
weapon<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.950> weapon<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.180> past

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
weapon and the weapon you can get past

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.150 
weapon and the weapon you can get past
with<00:02:36.750> something<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.410> lot<00:02:37.590> lower<00:02:37.770> than<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.130> I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
with something a lot lower than what I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.780 
with something a lot lower than what I
have<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.880> needs<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.640> bit

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
have it just needs to have if it's a bit

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.580 
have it just needs to have if it's a bit
slower<00:02:42.090> than<00:02:42.270> mine<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.660> better<00:02:42.870> mine's<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.440> bit

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
slower than mine is better mine's a bit

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.580 
slower than mine is better mine's a bit
fast<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.130> first<00:02:45.120> seismic<00:02:45.510> slam<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.440> had

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
fast for first seismic slam if if I had

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.880 
fast for first seismic slam if if I had
um<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:47.180> 1300<00:02:48.180> DPS<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:49.050> was<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.380> slower<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
um a 1300 DPS that was a lot slower it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
um a 1300 DPS that was a lot slower it
would<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.430> more<00:02:50.490> damage<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.150> seismic

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
would be a lot more damage for seismic

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.400 
would be a lot more damage for seismic
slam<00:02:51.750> then<00:02:52.380> even<00:02:52.770> my<00:02:52.980> 1700<00:02:53.670> eps<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:55.290> i'm

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
die also all the time and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.699 
die also all the time and
I<00:03:48.239> mean<00:03:48.719> it's<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.829> way<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.129> is

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
I mean it's just it's just the way it is

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.020 
I mean it's just it's just the way it is
let's<00:03:52.709> see<00:03:52.890> if<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.069> get<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.670> before<00:03:53.819> my

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
let's see if I can get up here before my

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.470 
let's see if I can get up here before my
cooldowns<00:03:54.390> wear<00:03:54.629> off<00:03:54.840> oh<00:03:55.109> yeah<00:03:55.439> there<00:03:55.650> we<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.769> I

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
cooldowns wear off oh yeah there we go I

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.509 
cooldowns wear off oh yeah there we go I
don't<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.689> second<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.260> but<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> got<00:03:58.799> one

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.360 

now<00:04:02.519> maybe<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.909> can<00:04:03.799> give<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> couple<00:04:05.219> of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
now maybe I can give that a couple of

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.190 
now maybe I can give that a couple of
seconds<00:04:05.760> wait<00:04:05.939> for<00:04:06.150> Megan<00:04:06.359> or<00:04:06.480> pain<00:04:06.719> before<00:04:07.049> I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
seconds wait for Megan or pain before I

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.899 
seconds wait for Megan or pain before I
try<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.439> kill<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> other<00:04:07.799> one<00:04:07.950> because<00:04:08.790> I

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
try and kill the other one because I

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.759 
try and kill the other one because I
though<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.269> don't<00:04:09.810> fancy<00:04:09.989> having<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.439> run<00:04:10.560> back

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
though I don't fancy having to run back

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:32.740 
though I don't fancy having to run back
again<00:04:11.239> that's<00:04:12.239> for<00:04:12.389> sure

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.409 

so<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.780> should<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.080> one<00:04:34.319> more<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:35.419> now

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
so I should have one more up here now

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.399 
so I should have one more up here now
and<00:04:36.800> we<00:04:37.800> can<00:04:38.039> get<00:04:38.189> them<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.849> trap<00:04:39.229> no<00:04:40.229> he

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
and we can get them in this trap no he

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.559 
and we can get them in this trap no he
looks<00:04:40.590> like<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.830> stuck<00:04:41.129> in<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> wall<00:04:41.610> well

this is where shift-click comes in can't

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:53.050 
this is where shift-click comes in can't
attack<00:04:48.960> me<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.259> can<00:04:49.530> attack<00:04:49.800> him<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:51.620> yeah
