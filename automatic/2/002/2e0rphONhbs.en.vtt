00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.089
 world see the novelties of the game so that no 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.529
 proposed in March 2011 that for each offer to compensate 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.909
 romagnons could even consider that this is one of the novelties 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.250
 compared to the old I think a sales bucket version 2010 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.060
 the 2000 version 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.730
 monster and a lot more thrust 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 so we go first the ump 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790
 power in the dune way of creating an image for example is a 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:29.970
 particular material 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 so I will create if you want to take the reins 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.420
 the skeleton materials 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.690
 created to a standard material simply that I will renamed 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.240
 to do this 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.900
 m karine vanasse hair for clear 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.450
 conchita show and in the diffuse for example to put a quick goal in 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.850
 proposing a directory 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.130
 Well, it does not interest me 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.240
 if you close that you have a bitmap loading fast indeed there is 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.010
 strictly nothing in terms of I walk on the hard drive that does not hold 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.860
 I showed you that it was possible to edit the bitmap would like to edit 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.080
 dishes you run it the software you chose I choose to leave 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 your departure 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.570
 so I made here gold new formats so we will do for example 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.390
 Iran 500 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.460
 a tower 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.200
 I'm leaving at 512 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 here is on a white background 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.370
 I'm going to fill this white background for example in competition them with each other 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 amiri 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.790
 I will save him 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.609
 fathers cortes for example site 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.609
 I am proud master sling 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.460
 and i'm going to use a fifth beatles image eg egypt 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.120
 chauzy compression mode 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 so imagine so it's not dramatic now I respect 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.090
 and if I come here 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.890
 okay 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 logically the bottom 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.740
 I just have to click it is recognized 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.759
 that was not the way to work to put a country image 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.370
 he says picture quickly 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.820
 and pick her up here 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.329
 if now I will use 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.329
 why do we take a box 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:09.989
 what he likes 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050
 here is but my ass 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.419
 40% during the powerful car 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.849
 stop w it's important to stop w 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.049
 with them the old harbor canal 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.349
 so them this car I'm going to put it 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.659
 1 string textures I saw my practice a dungeon studies but I 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.759
 my boxing 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.759
 ok and I'm going to convert this object into a hen 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.489
 toulouse the old port khalifa 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.759
 here it is 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.439
 while he's going to simply allow me two patrols on the object 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.259
 the object is selected 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.209
 and if you do peace 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.849
 g hassine standard at the palace look for a material 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.689
 to sign it indeed I point out that I did not assign this 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.689
 material by passing materials all elections 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.739
 in this case what can I do when I showed different 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.479
 techniques 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 I'm going to make the said say of to save temporary 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.859
 I want so 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.269
 redo a painting and I go to get it a material 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.420
 I am here it is a material the materials in the seine 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.240
 but unfortunately you a little 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 my material you play door can 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.109
 5 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.249
 I am now assigned to the selection 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.539
 I'm going to do for papeete automatically it tells you ok stop 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.339
 percent ecus now wants to use that or not 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.719
 if the material is assigned you find that this menu 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.129
 and if I choose that 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.560
 directly he will work on the dif then we will look 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.749
 I'm going for example not between 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.529
 this trait is simply for the way that not play 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.529
 and the options we do not care for the moment 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.089
 so the ball I could be 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.539
 see where my painting software there is nothing and if I win the repertoire 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.690
 in which to be saved 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.579
 there was absolutely nothing either 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.279
 it seems to you why there is nothing for the moment just the 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:04.930
 peace 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.609
 is a software apart 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.109
 killer layer we will say above 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.859
 so I always advise you happy to be together a screen with the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.240
 stop w function 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.920
 because under the name of the city of dieppe 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.849
 you see like that what you are painting 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.729
 if your view divided into four she's going to have some blocks of record on 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.729
 this view 2d 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.539
 to validate we stop the painting 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.629
 to be automatically they are 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.720
 in the fact that you do not show it i swear it saves because if 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.830
 I am now looking at March 10 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.129
 we see that the big mac at the pasture 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.949
 and if I do that right ones 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.110
 edit bitmap 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.419
 of course here these funds for that 8 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.830
 I will think about it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.460
 and I'm going to get 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.870
 and we find exactly the same and in the same repertoire 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.350
 so you have to save 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.030
 certainly but simply the old port canepa 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.490
 to see it in the view do not forget the show standard map 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.480
 investigation so that whatever you can in front you are doing 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.919
 can see 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.460
 directly in real time in life 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.039
 it's not because you pay 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.039
 that you will see it change the colors a little 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.629
 painting 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.059
 it's one thing but seeing the texture once it's finalized 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.490
 it's another thing 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.169
 and in this case we see that automatically as soon as I stop that 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.750
 except the precept before the taking into account it is for example a technique 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.199
 working 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.400
 so here I made word to gauge restore with this fall at the time 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.059
 that I did olten and here is my object 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.759
 I will now do something else I will not sell 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.879
 to concepcion in the show paravent 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.499
 ok and the city 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.389
 e choose a material 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.490
 why sign 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.139
 and if I will not sign a standard material so here it's as if 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.400
 I was in the materials editor and that binoculars 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.860
 ben listening a singer material is done and I'm going mattress a color 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.620
 diffuse that 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.970
 and this is here further determines the size of the image salim hachemi 24 to change 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.719
 I will leave the gray color 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.020
 they are made 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.449
 I will not change my name 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.879
 if I'm happy to hear my repertoire 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.360
 few changes 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 I will do text 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.610
 and I will choose for example this time but until when still and 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.110
 always 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.680
 if I validate ok 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.689
 What is going on 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.680
 had just if I go in the materials editor 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.620
 I go 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.009
 open another created since ovi or and i'm going to do some testing 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.189
 alas not with the pipette 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.279
 but I will loading materials 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.379
 automatically 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.629
 there is 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.469
 my image and the image of psychic risks 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.310
 if I say that the image that I do view and snow I want to find my image 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.880
 exactly for the bottom as bach save him what size at all 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:00.830
 touré that's like that two techniques 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.180
 you can of course without any problem by order however if I'm going 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.610
 change the color 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.809
 to be a parent 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:11.279
 but very well 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.279
 here is the painting done 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.470
 stopping because I had automatically assigned a 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:21.699
 image in diffuse 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:22.840
 automatically 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.430
 this painting and save here 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.789
 we find it in the materials editor 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:31.789
 and of course if I do it and displaced it's going well 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:37.449
 so that's one of the ways we work we'll see now 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:38.990
 another way 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.789
 and the palette not a little further 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:44.089
 but here is a little concept of the old port camargue we will go a little more 

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.580
 away with an object 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.210
 something else than a box of course
