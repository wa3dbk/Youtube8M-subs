00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.440
 I'm about to report we should now 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.029
 40 15 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.009
 I did not want anything 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
 15 16 for the first time she performed 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.470
 Words currently not shown the company 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.789
 division of labor 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.039
 how was it then that a mysterious story nobody wanted 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.179
 to pass on his secrets 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.079
 So I let it sink first 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.609
 down on Wednesday 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 formally dedicated to teachers 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.930
 and thus 2 23 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.340
 Hans by happy circumstances that I have the show off he has 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 to become still 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.390
 First of all, I disinfected my hands that is very important 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.120
 so we probably do not know in Switzerland agrees Fruit Contact 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.310
 are transferable 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.190
 afterward, upgrading Holtmann's workplace is difficult even today 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.630
 it is possible that Kaká will eventually go to court 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.940
 7 percent 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360
 almost done 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.699
 she would have to change that comes next 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.860
 various 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.550
 once again 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.450
 twice 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.520
 that does not lead me well 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.620
 Writings electromagnetic principle that in the end it um 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.340
 electromagnetic 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.230
 Dr on around 2 8 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.990
 by storm AC 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 You can often find this with grandma at the bell 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.800
 gone the old Klingenberg Unkenrufer coils 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.880
 you could make the small stairs machines pious 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 that is a later Prince Sebastian Gögel probably assistant electric motor 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.820
 through this short denominator » 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 the formula Holthausen refrigerator is the variation Bad Homburg location 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 and for the long distances one percent more money demanded 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.060
 important for the motive was she needed 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 I still have my wife caps before 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060
 and there the form is introduced 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.040
 that's what the machine has got 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.770
 and always take minimal color 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 and then bring in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.840
 it is not about new example so that would be about Formula One 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.260
 practically 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.029
 Timo Boll l switching the car would make it more difficult 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:16.749
 Foreign policy also comes along with this and that also means embarking 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.919
 and describes the way percent of loss 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.409
 people look for a tattoo artist 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.409
 so be sure to pay attention as the first book 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.129
 but is the most important rule 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.999
 it's hygienic to them 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.579
 Emotions themselves 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.429
 Show processes 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.629
 Routing processes let ministers work 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.609
 to say honestly 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.519
 Secondly 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.579
 First of all, let a photo folder show the title again 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.059
 whether the tattoo artist too 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.419
 able to realize your motives according to your wishes and wishes 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.919
 can correspond 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.619
 and third, very important 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.189
 what is the personal human relationship to the title of her 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.580
 Now it does not really work well to sit down 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.809
 agree with him 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 copes 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.809
 the average age 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.979
 to get to the mid-forties with people 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.089
 Woody Harrelson as want 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.909
 and our world is a crisis of faith 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.909
 Dr 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.079
 Schaan 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.069
 the financial crisis should be taken care of 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.459
 So in my opinion 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.019
 that was not so young people effect 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.719
 this is not a professional 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.799
 Chance were installed Red on the hand on the neck 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.260
 you should not just look at the customer as a good canvas and 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.139
 want 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.639
 Working wildly 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.999
 and you should not because of the money 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.999
 do any tattoo 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.279
 that would be difficult for me 500,000 times to put the same motive or desire 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.169
 to feel 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.769
 I did not do that, we try to put it in unique pieces 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.419
 and clearly no 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.340
 the kicker he comes in and wants coca-cola lettering we can 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.520
 not removed 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 he just always looks the same 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 the dark room is definitely not exhausting until the retirement age 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.189
 job 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.389
 Platform with the watchmaker maybe he himself 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.590
 we can not walk again we have to bochum-werne 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.069
 focus on working error free 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 it is very blame for it on the back joints 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.279
 without need eyes are very stressed 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.279
 and most titles we want everyone 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.020
 Grohl Algari I do not name any names 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
 50 55 clock 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.139
 Raúl always carries the risk 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.189
 open risk of infection and has Oberstaufen down 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.490
 if the customers complain as we say it 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.729
 actually no risk 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.930
 Mostly it is exploring negligence 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.930
 have the animals at home and get their hair in the wound 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.999
 and so the mouth was open, the customer still has two weeks to make the place 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.159
 Come in control 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.889
 and to show that healed is far from perfect 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:43.170
 come 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.009
 in the free one 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.210
 we send our people that are on the one hand the tattoo 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.360
 fits into the upper house
