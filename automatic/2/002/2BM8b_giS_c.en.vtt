00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 e 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 when we were young with my brothers he 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 there was one léonard who always 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 wanted to be a freddy coach who was 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 rather in the trade the woodstock in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.570
 general and I it was really 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.259
 breeding and it's a little bit like 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 you can see in the old 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.089
 families or the first son become pastor 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.679
 the second became military and the 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.269
 third became farmers bah here 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.099
 So you you are the third in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 third chief farmer of the family 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 but I am very proud back to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 sources 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.719
 back to the sources is exactly then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.620
 when you see little jewels like that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.449
 that's what luck we have 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 relationship to the job that can be done is 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.289
 to sell dreams 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 do people need 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 now the crisis the reality 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.160
 economic finally anything that happens 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.899
 on earth does that make people do that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.859
 not dream and a racehorse a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.550
 true racehorse 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 no matter who you are small 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.890
 ways one can fall on a good horse 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.050
 racing that makes you dream we go 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 enjoy I 'm going to show you what is 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.000
 we present for the month of August 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 it's nice so this is your first 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 linker neck line improves the jets 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.990
 brushes when he goes from sales to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.170
 resell publishes and that's something 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 because I have already introduced horses 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 for the month of July sales and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.880
 presented something for the month 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.370
 August 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.360
 it's something where generally 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.500
 breeders 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.539
 recovered 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.729
 happens to do here and there that's where 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.820
 they do it presented by another houara 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.829
 and there me in the new politics of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.340
 development which is so after past 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.200
 we are keen to have missed the first year 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.289
 senna hic it's magic and we see 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:09.770
 how beautiful it is if not mind 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:09.770
 losing this game is a good model 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.590
 here it is froman hafid of silver frost a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.769
 promising stallion and the sea ​​and by 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 kendor his mad sister men was really 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.099
 a very good filly who field 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.739
 sunday where kevin borgel and who had 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.349
 earned the rent of a list and one 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.069
 hope all who the best for these 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.560
 choice here here we really use a 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.489
 method a little bit like I do not have that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.750
 can say like children at school 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.180
 but that's when we want 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.140
 try to get them to do activities 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.269
 different every day to avoid 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.799
 a monotony that we quickly and they 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.230
 can start to get bored and we 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.180
 splits a lot of the meals for 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.349
 optimize 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.810
 their training is the living weight organ 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.230
 is important because to make 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.879
 foals of future champions 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.709
 it really takes a timer 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.689
 sion from the start is like a child 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.689
 we miss them we report them 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720

 settle 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.310

 that you wish to develop more 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.750
 I would like there we are in the process of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.890
 do a lot of new work 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.590
 construction of new developments 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.860
 to be able to receive more 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.750
 horses so soon yes we will be able 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.549
 grow up to be able to ride a little 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.220
 forty brood mares 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.479
 it's you who do the foaling yes 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.609
 quite with my first boy to 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.330
 Whenever one is foaling decline 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.160
 always 2 that already allows in case of 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.560
 problem of being two so that's when 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.300
 even a pair of extra arms and that 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.910
 as it's my first year this 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.220
 year the point boy who wrote mme you 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.090
 give me a hand is someone 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.190
 very experienced 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 so it also allowed me to enjoy 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.270
 from his hastily magical experience 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.960
 but the breeding is hard the breeding must 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.000
 also we are all day 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 in the boxes with the horses in the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.870
 fields and you go breeding is hard 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.940
 cowardly this is breeding in general it can 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.250
 to be so ungrateful and attached 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.289
 to male horses despite everything but he 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.500
 must also keep some distance 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.849
 for it's not business it's our 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.900
 business but it's at the same time 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.100
 the animal so noble that 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.100
 it touches us too 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.140
 Yes
