00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 hi everyone knows nastro and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.679
 today we find ourselves on this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 new video to teach you a 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.870
 little to increase the speed of your pc 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.870
 accelerate it a bit and make your 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.969
 navigation better so to something 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 to know what viruses the malware 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.409
 and all that stuff without the cause 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 main of the slowness of your pc 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.509
 so you have to be really careful 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.299
 to download or install 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.520
 software for example the pirate bay 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.819
 it's really a site where you do not have to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.729
 too much to let go so you have to be 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:23.340
 vigilant for that it was just the small 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.959
 info to know then we'll start everything 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.170
 immediately with the first picnic 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.409
 so that's changing the look 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.899
 of windows that we will all its effects 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.479
 all that you leave pretty well it's good 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.990
 beautiful all that but it eats a lot of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.270
 ram my heart to fix it remedy 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 got into windows computer 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 property that have you owned there you 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 will help advanced system settings there 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.530
 in the performance tab you go 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.879
 in settings and a click ensures adjusted 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.819
 in order to get the best 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.590
 performance and you tap on applied 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.879
 and then ok no I 'm not going to do it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.920
 because it's going to make bugger is that with this 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.890
 that I'm filming so it's just going 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.720
 you change this look separately 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.760
 pajot say it's going to do but hey 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.610
 it's much faster 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.770
 here it is much faster 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.780
 then the second the 2nd as you know we 're going 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.500
 play a little this time with the prompt 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.740
 some orders 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.210
 so if you are sure windows experts 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.400
 xp in my mean little wood story that 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.280
 can mark run or retype on 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 this not if you kind windows 7 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.459
 yes you are banging yourself directly on 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.080
 this part of research or be yes or 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.840
 click on the windows key 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.420
 so that you hold the key and 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.860
 you click on air and there you type 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.620
 it's one of the hiccups we're going to start 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.380
 with the disc so I think that 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.300
 it's the record of tree names on his 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.209
 trumps it's on your keyboard 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:12.989
 the two points that came back and there 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:16.500
 you type bi era slash s ok so that's it 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.670
 will go around all this drive is 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.690
 deleted all unnecessary files so 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.910
 it's going monza it can accelerate a little 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.769
 your pc 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.709
 because these are the files that 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.330
 windows does not use that it's useless 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.190
 to have them so you do that with 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.120
 all the records that you have so me 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 I'm just going to do it again with the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:50.100
 ddr slhs I think I sounded sorry 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.280
 so there you do with all your others 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.480
 discs I advise you between 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.239
 frankly to make it spring 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.190
 about once a month it's 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.549
 really here it is acceptable 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.610
 So they learn something so 30 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.650
 percussion the hercules so I you 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.489
 advise to follow this 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.640
 step you go from property computers 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.540
 by you at the e3 he's using it and stoner's 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.540
 devices you click there you go 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.330
 in the Systems Devices tab 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.229
 and there you go where it is 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.380
 marked in log system cmcm os real time 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:36.160
 so you double click and you go in 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.750
 the resources tab and there below 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.370
 the beach has marked and gone beyond 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.860
 so I'm not going to put between 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.100
 parentheses months its marks and 0.8 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.539
 so maybe for you there will be 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.330
 just 1.8 whiter what's needed 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.470
 know it's parenthetically its 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.800
 marks and 0.8 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.740
 or so yes you can conclude this 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.320
 this step otherwise I advise you to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.460
 you stop here so I can I 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.070
 continue what he did not care about age 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.970
 does as before I open to 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:23.830
 run windows r there i'm typing re i 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.930
 had hits and I said ok on ok one 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.110
 is easy 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.840
 click ok mission so this is 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.139
 the registry editor there you go you 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.479
 buy local vaulted macheath rolled from 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.330
 the un there again you go in 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.180
 system or roads she has her 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.110
 current that reindeers against 7 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.660
 you open there you go in the 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.979
 control you still open it not 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.220
 begins to do a lot 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:58.770
 it is not serious and there below 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.900
 print ya prior and who roegs there 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.310
 what do you have to do 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.970
 we see that you are only open to yourself 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.280
 your computer property you go 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.639
 see your operating system so 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:16.919
 mine is 104 prospeed that's 64 bits 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.650
 so for me for my case you trust it 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.320
 I will go into the new edition is 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.020
 in high place click on dword value 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.280
 32 bits for those who have 32 pc 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.020
 quickly I'm going to hold on key words 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.300
 signature takes 2 peak is fine here and 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.130
 what kills me gets in four sets and 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.289

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:46.020
