00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
at you dealt with half screen for a lap

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.430 
at you dealt with half screen for a lap
so<00:03:29.130> each<00:03:29.400> time<00:03:29.670> like<00:03:29.959> finish<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:30.989> lappy

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
so each time like finish your lappy

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.910 
so each time like finish your lappy
double<00:03:31.770> top<00:03:31.920> screen<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:34.110> then<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:37.110> watch<00:03:37.500> I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
double top screen and then the watch I

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.250 
double top screen and then the watch I
would<00:03:38.400> probably<00:03:38.700> say<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.330> wash<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.989> on<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
would probably say the wash is on the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.090 
would probably say the wash is on the
market<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.620> now<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:41.250> about<00:03:41.989> 2<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.739> two

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
market right now for about 2 is for two

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.720 
market right now for about 2 is for two
hundred<00:03:44.280> dollars<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.870> probably<00:03:46.170> price

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
hundred dollars so that I probably price

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.199 
hundred dollars so that I probably price
prices<00:03:47.730> as<00:03:48.000> 150<00:03:49.070> /<00:03:50.070> 2<00:03:50.400> 175<00:03:51.470> just<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:53.209> it's

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
prices as 150 / 2 175 just because it's

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.259 
prices as 150 / 2 175 just because it's
not<00:03:54.540> all<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.989> fancy<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:56.340> saying<00:03:56.940> can't

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
not all that fancy like it saying can't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.320 
not all that fancy like it saying can't
even<00:03:57.630> sounds<00:03:58.080> like<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.860> old<00:03:59.330> plastic

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
even sounds like one of the old plastic

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
even sounds like one of the old plastic
watches<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:01.739> for<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:02.250> cheap<00:04:02.489> or

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
watches you can get for really cheap or

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.000 
watches you can get for really cheap or
also<00:04:04.400> also<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:06.300> i<00:04:06.720> would<00:04:07.200> probably<00:04:07.500> pricey<00:04:07.709> more

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
also also a i would probably pricey more

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.650 
also also a i would probably pricey more
if<00:04:08.220> there<00:04:08.400> was<00:04:08.550> color<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> screen<00:04:09.420> but

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
if there was color on the screen but

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.590 
if there was color on the screen but
