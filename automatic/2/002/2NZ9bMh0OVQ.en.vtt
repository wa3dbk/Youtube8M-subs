So you're coming to UAlbany not sure what
to bring? No problem, we'll help you out.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.580
Let's get started.
The first thing you need to know about UAlbany

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.280
dorm life is that the beds are Extra Long
Twin. So it's really important to buy those

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.870
size sheets when you go shopping and you can
get them at any department store this time

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.300
of year. UAlbany also offers a Residence Hall
Linens program. To find out more about it,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.600
visit www.RHL.org. Another item you'll need
is a shower tote. Whether you have a bathroom

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.550
in your suite or a shared bathroom in the corridor,
a shower tote helps keep all of your toiletries

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.300
organized and together. You're also going
to need a reliable alarm clock. If you're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.109
join got use your cellphone make sure that
the battery is charged. You don't want to

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:58.789
be late for class (MUSIC PLAYS). Really?
The Residence Halls are not air conditioned

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.329
so bring a fan. but don't worry you can also
leave the windows open to let fresh air in.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
One thing you need to know, is that extension cords
are not permitted in the residence halls. You

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270
need to bring a surge protector for items
like computers. Speaking of computers, whether

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.159
you have a laptop, a desktop, a tablet, or
a smartphone, all our halls have wireless

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.030
internet access so you can always stay connected.
Another item not to forget is high efficiency

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.299
laundry detergent. You're not at your parents
anymore, so you're going to have to do your

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.280
own laundry. So if you don't know how, make
sure someone teaches you before you come to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.329
campus. And don't worry about bringing quarters,
all the laundry machines at UAlbany are free.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.630
Be sure to pack smart, contact your roommate
ahead of time so you know who's bringing what.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.929
You definitely want to avoid doubling up on
large items. Trust me, two big screen TV's

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.479
or your parents' six foot couch are not going
to fit. Besides, it's a great way to start

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.399
a relationship with your new roommate. And
finally, I recommend buying some type of renter's

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.520
insurance. It'll cover any of your lost
or damaged items, like your television, your

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.560
laptop, your video game system, it's really
just best to be safe. We hope these tips have

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.480
helped. Can't wait to see you around campus!
Bye Guys! See ya!
