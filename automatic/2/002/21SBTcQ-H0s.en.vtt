00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.520
 our skin consists of three layers 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.280
 epidermis and dermis and subcutaneous adipose 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.110
 cellulose epidermis we all see and here 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.759
 derma plays the role of a skeleton which 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 provides mechanical properties to the skin 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.719
 Tensile strength elasticity 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 these qualities are due to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.369
 collagen and elastin fibers and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 part of the dermis in youth 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.660
 fibers are constantly being updated and with 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 by age this process also slows down 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.800
 work of special cells worsens 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 fibroblasts their task is to destroy and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 dispose of damaged fibers 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 old collagen and elastin as they 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 don't make fibers stretch and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
 skin ages loses elasticity and shape 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.050
 becomes loose wrinkled sags 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370
 leave however there is 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.200
 radio wave lifting or thermolifting 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 this is a method of non-surgical tightening and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.780
 skin rejuvenation based on 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 high frequency exposure 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.690
 electric current at time procedure 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.690
 radio wave lifting wave 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.969
 radio frequency range 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.579
 penetrates deep into the skin and 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.520
 reaches the collagen fibers and attaches 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.870
 in part of his 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.470
 through powerful heat 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.770
 impact this leads to a reduction 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.170
 collagen skeleton fibers 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 provides a more dense shrinkage of the skin to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 facial muscles based on radio lifting 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.990
 It is long known in medicine and method 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.670
 deep warming of tissues by currents 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 high frequency and large power 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 the uniqueness of this method is that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.570
 the surface layer of the skin is not damaged 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.520
 thanks to strong heating up to 42 45 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 degrees in the dermis expands the blood 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.890
 vessels and the correct exchange resumes 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.479
 substances other than this 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 radio wave activates accelerated 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.570
 collagen production characteristic of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 young skin and stimulate joseph out 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.360
 fibroblasts due to this reduced 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.150
 the depth and number of wrinkles is improved 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.430
 exchange and 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.830
 skin processes skin becomes more 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.800

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.210

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.160
 age changes by radio 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 lifting is possible not only on the face but also on 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.930
 hips and abdomen and décolleté 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.290
 the procedure is very comfortable and pleasant 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.179
 a person feels very pleasantly warm 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.710
 it is important that during the procedure the skin is not 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.760
 getting injured ie not needed 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.710
 recovery period 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.260
 no postoperative complications and 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.670
 other risks as skin remains without 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.050
 damage to the radio lifting is very 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.640
 attractive for men who 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.860
 dreams of rejuvenation but do not want to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.040
 this found out for the sake of wave 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.709
 rejuvenation consists of an average of seven 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.190
 procedures and are carried out at intervals of 1 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.030

 good anti-aging result 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.990
 a length of two to three years from 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.860
 one session to another skin becomes 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.690
 it is better 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.819
 the real result is noticeable even after 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.620
 first procedure within six months 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.370
 after the course, a synthesis of the new takes place 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.020
 collagen 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.270
 rejuvenation effect all this time 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.220
 continues to grow thanks to the radio 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.090
