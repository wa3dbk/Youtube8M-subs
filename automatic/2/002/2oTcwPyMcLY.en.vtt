 the only point in which the climate of the poor have as rain that to act the city does not 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.710

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 which diverts the accounts to the bad way 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.510
 and he himself will fall into the account I made 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.790
 but respondents inherited 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790

 so to the wicked who rule over a poor people 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.549
 the prince lacking in intelligence multiplies the oppressions 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.799
 but he that hateth covetousness 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.889

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.699
 no one from the detainee 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.899
 what I walk integrity will be saved 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.899
 but the wicked in their ways that bound the name

 longer ran after companies but did not know what the division was 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.739
 in penury 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.980
 the one who rebuked the moment to sore after more favor 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.049
 than that which our anthem says with the tongue 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.369

 we have to face 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
 he who trusts in his own heart is foolish 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.609
 but he that walketh in wisdom shall be saved. 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.829
 kindle may not lack 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.309
 the case that risk where the eyes will be accumulated from new dreams

 when the wicked rise the men hide themselves 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.769
