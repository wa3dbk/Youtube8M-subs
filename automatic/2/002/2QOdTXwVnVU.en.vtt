00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
I made sure I do the order before I came

I made sure I do the order before I came
here

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
here

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.229 
here
the<00:00:31.920> first<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.399> pretty<00:00:32.640> easy<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> figure

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the first two are pretty easy to figure

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
the first two are pretty easy to figure
out<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.780> mean<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.710> guessing<00:00:34.980> though<00:00:35.219> it's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
out I mean it's all guessing though it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.770 
out I mean it's all guessing though it's
the<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> guy<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the all the guy it's not like I do a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
the all the guy it's not like I do a
stretch<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.350> eight<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.040> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
stretch for eight so it's really it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.970 
stretch for eight so it's really it's
all<00:00:38.399> guessing<00:00:38.790> until<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:40.800> one

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
all guessing until you know this one

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.709 
all guessing until you know this one
it's<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> ones<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> are<00:00:42.149> crossing<00:00:42.629> each

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's all the ones that are crossing each

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's all the ones that are crossing each
other<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.170> yeah<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
other I think yeah there we go and I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.000 
other I think yeah there we go and I
think<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.140> faster<00:00:46.440> figure<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> more

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
think the faster figure out the more

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:59.770 
think the faster figure out the more
points<00:00:47.190> here

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.680 

cool<00:01:01.640> sounds<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> selling<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> mic<00:01:03.570> coming

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
cool sounds like a selling a mic coming

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.520 
cool sounds like a selling a mic coming

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.359 

but<00:01:54.950> no<00:01:55.100> problem<00:01:56.799> maybe<00:01:57.799> we<00:01:57.979> have<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.130> do<00:01:58.250> the

not there was no certain order I think
no<00:02:15.680> matter<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:15.980> many<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.550> put<00:02:16.700> down<00:02:16.850> it's

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
no matter how many you put down it's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.520 
no matter how many you put down it's
just<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.239> combination<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.989> what<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
just a combination but what is the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.780 
just a combination but what is the
combination<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.569> question

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:38.140 

combinations<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:34.010> know<00:02:36.400> yeah<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.880> all

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
combinations you know yeah it's like all

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.559 
combinations you know yeah it's like all
these<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.600> then<00:02:38.690> one<00:02:38.930> nope<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.360> can<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
these and then one nope and we can just

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:51.500 
these and then one nope and we can just
experiment<00:02:41.989> here

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.990

come on why would you make a minigame

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.660 
come on why would you make a minigame
like<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:58.430> always<00:02:59.430> know<00:03:00.470> all<00:03:01.470> these<00:03:01.860> down<00:03:02.370> and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
like this always know all these down and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.259 
like this always know all these down and
then<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:06.110> no<00:03:07.580> was<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.940> can't

I think the only only way to make me go

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.390 
I think the only only way to make me go
faster<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.229> get<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.439> question<00:04:56.770> woman<00:04:59.400> will

faster is to get the question woman will

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.089 
faster is to get the question woman will
karate<00:05:00.909> but<00:05:01.300> if<00:05:01.419> we<00:05:01.539> like<00:05:01.719> get<00:05:02.319> one<00:05:02.439> wrong<00:05:02.620> and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
then they race 8:28 come on then this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.260 
then they race 8:28 come on then this
day<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:08.979> if<00:05:09.159> they<00:05:09.280> like<00:05:09.310> they'll<00:05:09.729> erase<00:05:10.030> them

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
day like if they like they'll erase them

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.540 
day like if they like they'll erase them
and<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.539> got<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.169> ten<00:05:11.349> seconds<00:05:11.680> go<00:05:11.770> up<00:05:11.889> and<00:05:12.280> then

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
and I got the ten seconds go up and then

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.820 
and I got the ten seconds go up and then
if<00:05:12.669> they<00:05:12.819> erase<00:05:13.150> like<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.990> one<00:05:14.169> you<00:05:14.319> have<00:05:14.530> the

if they erase like the one you have the
time<00:05:14.979> will<00:05:15.219> get<00:05:15.340> cut<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.639> little<00:05:15.849> bit<00:05:15.939> which<00:05:16.150> is

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
time will get cut a little bit which is

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.469 
time will get cut a little bit which is
actually<00:05:16.629> kind<00:05:16.750> of<00:05:16.780> convenient

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.369 

let's<00:05:20.110> take<00:05:20.319> a<00:05:20.349> look<00:05:20.620> actually<00:05:20.889> yeah<00:05:21.900> it's<00:05:22.900> a

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
let's take a look actually yeah it's a

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.800 
let's take a look actually yeah it's a
smiley<00:05:23.860> face<00:05:24.069> there<00:05:26.009> we<00:05:27.009> go<00:05:27.129> see<00:05:27.599> shortcuts<00:05:28.599> I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
smiley face there we go see shortcuts I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.510 
smiley face there we go see shortcuts I
think<00:05:29.110> did<00:05:29.289> that<00:05:29.319> wasn't<00:05:29.680> no<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.009> wasn't<00:05:30.430> I
