 I 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.920
 this 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.679
 reportedly 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.450
 R 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.900

 having gone nowhere players but brigadier 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.420

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.580
 such a show 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 but there were other representatives 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.280
 sony filed damages police 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.730
 balance 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.700
 here which should 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.230
 jsc trade mode water saving 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.630

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.630
 only person state 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.210
 and the experience of previous 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.850
 if by law but simply because it is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.030
 only on hand 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.679

 last year 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.500
 during the break 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 if we talk about whose shortly before 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.350
 break 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.600
