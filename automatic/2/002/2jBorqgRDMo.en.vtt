as<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.920> hopefully<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.850> video

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
as you can see hopefully in this video

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.650 
as you can see hopefully in this video
is<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.489> locking<00:00:56.489> bars<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.480> on

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is that we have locking bars that are on

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.619 
is that we have locking bars that are on
all<00:00:57.930> four<00:00:58.350> sides<00:00:58.670> these<00:00:59.670> are<00:00:59.850> set<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
all four sides these are set up so that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.840 
all four sides these are set up so that
they<00:01:00.780> come<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.230> almost<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> corner<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they come in almost up to the corner of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.020 
they come in almost up to the corner of
your<00:01:03.030> frame<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> outside<00:01:03.870> dimension<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:06.000> have

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
your frame the outside dimension we have

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
your frame the outside dimension we have
a<00:01:07.010> dual<00:01:08.010> cylinder<00:01:08.549> set<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.090> each<00:01:09.119> side<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:10.470> has

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
a dual cylinder set on each side it has

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
a dual cylinder set on each side it has
a<00:01:10.650> three<00:01:10.979> inch<00:01:11.100> stroke

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a three inch stroke

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.520 
a three inch stroke
we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.610> tilted<00:01:14.689> mounting<00:01:15.689> brackets<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.380> what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
we have tilted mounting brackets so what

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
we have tilted mounting brackets so what
that's<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.210> pulling

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that's going to do is as we're pulling

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
that's going to do is as we're pulling
in<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> mesh<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
in on the on the mesh we're going to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
in on the on the mesh we're going to
have<00:01:20.790> these<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.110> hopefully<00:01:22.350> won't

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
have these so that they hopefully won't

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.490 
have these so that they hopefully won't
lift<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.250> us<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.450> careful<00:01:25.140> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
lift up on us but to be careful with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
lift up on us but to be careful with
this<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.920> lot<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.400> times<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.790> chain<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.180> down

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this a lot of times we chain them down

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.230 
this a lot of times we chain them down
anyways<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> safe<00:01:28.950> side<00:01:29.240> we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
anyways just to be on the safe side we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
anyways just to be on the safe side we
have<00:01:30.450> our<00:01:30.750> locking<00:01:31.320> bars<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have our locking bars which is how we

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.969 
have our locking bars which is how we
put<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> mesh<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.650> Chris<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put the mesh in and Chris is going to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
put the mesh in and Chris is going to
load<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.670> us<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> we're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
load this up for us and we're going to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:47.010 
load this up for us and we're going to
stretch<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.680> glue<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> up

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.319 

okay<00:01:47.680> we<00:01:47.860> already<00:01:48.130> had<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.490> side<00:01:48.729> locked<00:01:49.030> in

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
okay we already had this side locked in

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.120 
okay we already had this side locked in
as<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.720> can<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.560> what<00:01:50.710> he's<00:01:50.799> going<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.950> do

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
as you can see so what he's going to do

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.160 
as you can see so what he's going to do
is<00:01:51.340> draw<00:01:51.640> back<00:01:51.880> over<00:01:52.299> it<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> little<00:01:52.420> bit<00:01:52.780> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
is draw back over it a little bit you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.800 
is draw back over it a little bit you
know<00:01:53.259> pull<00:01:53.799> in<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.100> fabric<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:54.759> then<00:01:55.479> lock<00:01:55.780> it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
know pull in the fabric and then lock it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.620 
know pull in the fabric and then lock it
down<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.290> place<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> we're<00:01:58.240> going<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.420> draw<00:01:58.600> it

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
down in place so we're going to draw it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.880 
down in place so we're going to draw it
over<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.490> snap<00:02:04.619> okay

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
over and snap okay

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.820 
over and snap okay
we're<00:02:06.789> using<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.420> compressed<00:02:08.050> air<00:02:08.229> obviously

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
we're using a compressed air obviously

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.699 
we're using a compressed air obviously
out<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.160> our<00:02:09.360> compressor<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.539> we're<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.650> to

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
out of our compressor and we're going to

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.430 
out of our compressor and we're going to
have<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.580> take<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.170> dual

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
have that and take it so we have a dual

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.800 
have that and take it so we have a dual
pulling<00:02:14.950> mechanism<00:02:15.069> he<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:15.910> one<00:02:16.239> control

pulling mechanism he has one control

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500 
pulling mechanism he has one control
that's<00:02:17.470> pulling<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.220> way<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.239> one

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's pulling this way and then one

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.360 
that's pulling this way and then one
that's<00:02:19.690> pulling<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.260> opposite<00:02:20.709> direction

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.280 

he's<00:02:24.370> going<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.700> use<00:02:24.940> these<00:02:25.239> tension<00:02:26.080> meter

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.770 

good<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.250> lot<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.820> cases<00:02:56.000> what<00:02:56.300> we<00:02:56.390> like<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.570> do

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
good a lot of cases what we like to do

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.360 
good a lot of cases what we like to do
is<00:02:56.900> then<00:02:57.080> let<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.380> sit<00:02:57.620> for<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.800> little<00:02:57.860> bit

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
is then let it sit for a little bit

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.520 
is then let it sit for a little bit
check<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.880> again<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.870> make<00:03:00.050> sure<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.410> we

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
check it again just to make sure that we

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.800 
check it again just to make sure that we
haven't<00:03:00.770> lost<00:03:00.980> any<00:03:01.310> tension<00:03:01.700> at<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.570> same

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
haven't lost any tension at the same

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.350 
haven't lost any tension at the same
time<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.140> might<00:03:03.500> add<00:03:03.530> when<00:03:04.430> we're<00:03:04.640> pulling<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
time I might add when we're pulling in

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.420 
time I might add when we're pulling in
these<00:03:05.870> are<00:03:06.140> freestanding

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
these are freestanding

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.600 
these are freestanding
on<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:08.150> bed<00:03:08.630> itself<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.620> they're<00:03:09.860> pushing<00:03:10.190> in

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
on the bed itself so they're pushing in

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
on the bed itself so they're pushing in
their<00:03:10.910> pre<00:03:11.210> following<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:11.870> frame<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.500> that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
their pre following this frame so that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.530 
their pre following this frame so that
when<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:13.430> actually<00:03:13.730> cut<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.030> out<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.360> mesh

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
when we actually cut it out of the mesh

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.050 
when we actually cut it out of the mesh
it's<00:03:15.320> going<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> pop<00:03:15.830> back<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.310> place<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:16.820> we

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
it's going to pop back in place so we

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.820 
it's going to pop back in place so we
maintain<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.480> tension<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.140> we<00:03:18.260> had<00:03:18.410> set<00:03:18.680> to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
maintain that tension that we had set to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.490 
maintain that tension that we had set to
retire<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.660> guess<00:03:20.660> we<00:03:20.810> can<00:03:20.930> actually<00:03:21.230> move<00:03:21.320> into

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
retire I guess we can actually move into

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000 
retire I guess we can actually move into
the<00:03:21.620> actual<00:03:22.720> gluing<00:03:23.720> right<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.650> okay

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
the actual gluing right we can okay

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.300 
the actual gluing right we can okay
let's<00:03:25.310> do<00:03:25.430> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
let's do it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.470 
let's do it
okay<00:03:29.710> okay<00:03:30.710> again<00:03:31.160> we're<00:03:31.430> using<00:03:31.460> Rhino<00:03:32.180> Mike

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
okay okay again we're using Rhino Mike

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.670 
okay okay again we're using Rhino Mike

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650 
clear ambarish color or a red color so
he's<00:03:41.030> taken<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.480> little<00:03:41.570> squeeze<00:03:41.930> bottle<00:03:43.660> puts

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
he's taken a little squeeze bottle puts

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.960 
he's taken a little squeeze bottle puts
a<00:03:44.750> bead<00:03:44.960> down<00:03:45.170> each<00:03:45.440> side<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:46.070> then<00:03:46.520> spreads

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
a bead down each side and then spreads

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.970 
a bead down each side and then spreads
it<00:03:47.210> making<00:03:47.870> sure<00:03:48.050> that<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:48.410> penetrating

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
it making sure that it's penetrating

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.150 
it making sure that it's penetrating
through<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.280> mesh<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:50.510> bond<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.200> securely<00:03:51.710> on

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
through the mesh and bond is securely on

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.920 
through the mesh and bond is securely on
the<00:03:52.310> frame<00:03:52.610> itself<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:56.330> one<00:03:56.480> thing<00:03:56.720> that's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
the frame itself so one thing that's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.600 
the frame itself so one thing that's
nice<00:03:57.080> about<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:57.590> product<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.280> actually

nice about this product is we actually

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.740 
nice about this product is we actually
also<00:03:58.760> make<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.300> in<00:03:59.420> three<00:03:59.570> different

percent solid space you're going to want

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.540 
percent solid space you're going to want
to<00:04:07.280> use<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:08.390> thicker<00:04:08.960> material<00:04:09.550> specifically

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
to use the thicker material specifically

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.200 
to use the thicker material specifically
when<00:04:10.730> you're<00:04:10.880> doing<00:04:11.210> coarser<00:04:11.690> meshes<00:04:12.020> and

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
when you're doing coarser meshes and

in those high mesh house at 390 420 and
higher<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:20.000> way<00:04:20.030> we<00:04:20.299> make<00:04:20.510> sure<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:20.930> we've

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
higher that way we make sure that we've

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.800 
higher that way we make sure that we've
Senate<00:04:21.410> rated<00:04:21.710> through<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:22.570> you'll<00:04:23.570> notice

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
Senate rated through it you'll notice

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.010 
Senate rated through it you'll notice
that<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.710> have<00:04:24.950> two<00:04:25.760> parts<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.450> we<00:04:26.720> have

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
that we have two parts to this we have

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.900 
that we have two parts to this we have
our<00:04:28.030> glue<00:04:29.030> and<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:29.540> have<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.720> catalyst<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:30.950> we

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
our glue and we have a catalyst so we

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.140 
our glue and we have a catalyst so we
mix<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.480> prior<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.950> catalyst<00:04:34.460> actually<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
mix that prior the catalyst actually the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.030 
mix that prior the catalyst actually the
primary<00:04:35.450> function<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:36.290> is<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:36.920> it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
primary function of that is so that it

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:47.970 
primary function of that is so that it
gives<00:04:37.250> us<00:04:37.520> good<00:04:38.440> solvent<00:04:39.440> resistance

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.700 

okay<00:04:48.760> that's<00:04:49.090> how<00:04:49.210> simple<00:04:49.270> this<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.780> Chris

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
okay that's how simple this is Chris

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.590 
okay that's how simple this is Chris
just<00:04:50.980> went<00:04:51.160> around<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.520> frame<00:04:51.760> would<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.450> be

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
just went around the frame would it be

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.870 
just went around the frame would it be
spread<00:04:53.170> it<00:04:53.290> out<00:04:53.380> now<00:04:54.100> we<00:04:54.160> have<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.430> let<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.610> dry

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
spread it out now we have to let it dry

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.430 
spread it out now we have to let it dry
but<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.450> particular<00:04:55.660> product<00:04:56.170> you're

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
but this particular product you're

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.300 
but this particular product you're
looking<00:04:56.740> at<00:04:56.920> approximately<00:04:57.580> 8<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.720> 12<00:04:59.020> minutes

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
looking at approximately 8 to 12 minutes

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.310 
looking at approximately 8 to 12 minutes
but<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.460> will<00:05:00.580> depend<00:05:00.700> a<00:05:00.940> lot<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.150> where<00:05:02.110> you

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
but that will depend a lot on where you

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.980 
but that will depend a lot on where you
are<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:03.040> temperature<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.240> humidity<00:05:04.360> level

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
are the temperature the humidity level

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.620 
are the temperature the humidity level
and<00:05:05.140> so<00:05:05.290> forth<00:05:05.700> when<00:05:06.700> you<00:05:06.880> do<00:05:07.030> come<00:05:07.240> back<00:05:07.450> and

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
and so forth when you do come back and

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.090 
and so forth when you do come back and
you<00:05:07.690> start<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.080> check<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.440> though<00:05:08.590> if<00:05:08.950> you

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
you start to check it though if you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.070 
you start to check it though if you
think<00:05:09.130> it's<00:05:09.460> dry<00:05:09.730> you<00:05:10.120> touch<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.810> feels

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
think it's dry you touch it and it feels

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.110 
think it's dry you touch it and it feels
really<00:05:11.260> cold<00:05:11.560> let<00:05:12.310> us<00:05:12.430> sit<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.640> couple<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:12.970> more
