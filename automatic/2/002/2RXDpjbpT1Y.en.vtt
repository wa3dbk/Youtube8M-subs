00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
head for some time because all that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.620 
head for some time because all that
build-up<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.780> moisture<00:02:47.260> causes<00:02:48.220> more<00:02:49.090> bumps

build-up of moisture causes more bumps

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
and it causes the bacteria to continue

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.250 
and it causes the bacteria to continue
to<00:02:53.290> live<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.709> your<00:02:53.800> head<00:02:54.630> alright<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.140> from
