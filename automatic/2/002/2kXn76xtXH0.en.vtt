hey what's up you guys so I'm gonna

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey what's up you guys so I'm gonna
Plasti<00:00:02.939> Dip<00:00:02.970> over<00:00:03.449> my<00:00:03.629> sideview<00:00:03.929> mirrors

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
Plasti Dip over my sideview mirrors

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.490 
Plasti Dip over my sideview mirrors
today<00:00:05.480> mainly<00:00:06.480> because<00:00:06.629> there's<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.170> little

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
today mainly because there's a little

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.259 
today mainly because there's a little
bit<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.680> paint<00:00:07.890> peeling<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.370> them<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.760> doesn't

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
bit of paint peeling on them and doesn't

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.340 
bit of paint peeling on them and doesn't
look<00:00:09.420> very<00:00:09.719> attractive<00:00:11.750> it's<00:00:12.750> pretty<00:00:13.049> easy<00:00:14.120> a

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
look very attractive it's pretty easy a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.779 
look very attractive it's pretty easy a
classic<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.440> before<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.520> first

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
classic bit before so it's not my first

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.990 
classic bit before so it's not my first
time<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.420> see<00:00:18.539> how<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> goes

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
time but we'll see how it goes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.429 
time but we'll see how it goes
you'd<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.180> those<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> definitely<00:00:21.960> masked

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you'd see those and I definitely masked

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.429 
you'd see those and I definitely masked
off<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> whole<00:00:23.039> area<00:00:23.660> because<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.840> this

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
off the whole area because I think this

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
off the whole area because I think this
is<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> angles<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.640> there's<00:00:26.939> gonna

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is all the angles on here there's gonna

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.470 
is all the angles on here there's gonna
be<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> lot<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> overspray<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:30.060> simpler

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
be a lot of overspray on the simpler

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.440 
be a lot of overspray on the simpler
projects<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:32.219> big<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.610> deal

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.240 

but<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> messed<00:00:37.320> off<00:00:37.530> pretty

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
but as you can see I messed off pretty

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
but as you can see I messed off pretty
much<00:00:38.390> dulling<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> silver<00:00:39.870> part<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.559> black

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
much dulling this silver part the black

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
much dulling this silver part the black
part<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.430> behind<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> silver<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
part right behind the silver part you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
part right behind the silver part you
can<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.379> plastic<00:00:43.920> part<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> just

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
can see is a plastic part and I just

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.290 
can see is a plastic part and I just
want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> leave<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.469> like<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.059> like<00:00:48.059> the

want to leave that like it is like the
little<00:00:48.570> it'll<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.770> different

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
little it'll be a little bit different

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.860 
little it'll be a little bit different
color<00:00:50.520> than<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.000> black<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.510> I'll<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> nice

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.820 

I<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:25.780> already<00:01:25.930> tell<00:01:26.170> I'm<00:01:26.380> getting<00:01:26.680> some

I can already tell I'm getting some

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.980 
I can already tell I'm getting some
overspray<00:01:27.300> everywhere<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:28.660> glad<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.900> put

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
overspray everywhere so I'm glad I put

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.770 
overspray everywhere so I'm glad I put
the<00:01:29.230> masking<00:01:29.650> paper<00:01:30.130> down<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:37.480> I<00:01:37.540> can't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
the masking paper down and I can't

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.030 
the masking paper down and I can't
stress<00:01:37.900> enough<00:01:38.140> from<00:01:38.410> doing<00:01:38.740> my<00:01:38.830> wheels

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
stress enough from doing my wheels

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.300 
stress enough from doing my wheels
before<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.500> multiple<00:01:41.500> times<00:01:41.680> actually<00:01:42.130> that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
before and multiple times actually that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.340 
before and multiple times actually that
you<00:01:42.580> definitely<00:01:43.090> want<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.510> make<00:01:43.930> sure<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.200> can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
you definitely want to make sure you can

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.350 
you definitely want to make sure you can
tackle<00:01:44.500> all<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.980> angles<00:01:45.340> within<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.910> project

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
tackle all the angles within the project

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.900 
tackle all the angles within the project
and<00:01:47.050> don't<00:01:47.410> take<00:01:47.530> any<00:01:47.740> shortcuts<00:01:48.160> one<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.790> you

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
and don't take any shortcuts one of you

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.760 
and don't take any shortcuts one of you
patient<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:50.700> let<00:01:51.700> least<00:01:51.910> 15<00:01:52.600> minutes<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.530> dry

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
patient and let least 15 minutes to dry

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.730 
patient and let least 15 minutes to dry
in<00:01:54.010> between<00:01:54.040> coats<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:55.990> get<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.350> full

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
in between coats so you get the full

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.700 
in between coats so you get the full
performance<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.520> was<00:01:57.670> cold<00:01:57.970> out<00:01:58.120> today<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:59.650> I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
performance it was cold out today so I

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.770 
performance it was cold out today so I
waited<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.950> little<00:02:00.010> bit<00:02:00.160> longer<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.690> want

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
waited a little bit longer if you want

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.610 
waited a little bit longer if you want
you<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.320> just<00:02:02.680> blow<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.160> it<00:02:03.190> or<00:02:03.970> anything<00:02:04.620> both

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
you can just blow on it or anything both

you can just blow on it or anything both
get<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.130> second<00:02:06.430> coat

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
second coat I'm going to go a little bit

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.920 
second coat I'm going to go a little bit
heavier<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.230> coat<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.660> make<00:02:16.900> sure

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
heavier on this coat just to make sure

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.710 
heavier on this coat just to make sure
I'm<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.310> missing<00:02:18.310> any<00:02:18.490> little<00:02:19.209> spots<00:02:19.480> like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
I'm not missing any little spots like

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.540 
I'm not missing any little spots like
underneath<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.590> top<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.490> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
underneath or on top and so I can get a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.220 
underneath or on top and so I can get a
clear<00:02:24.940> break<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> started<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.990> peel<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
clear break when I started to peel it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:37.369 
clear break when I started to peel it
off

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.309 

I<00:02:38.379> ended<00:02:38.650> up<00:02:38.799> putting<00:02:39.690> four<00:02:40.690> coats<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.140> this

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
I ended up putting four coats on this

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.180 
I ended up putting four coats on this
thing<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.790> enough<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.450> me<00:02:43.890> came<00:02:44.890> out<00:02:45.040> they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
thing just enough for me came out they

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.880 
thing just enough for me came out they
will<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.569> masking<00:02:47.049> move<00:02:47.290> was<00:02:47.530> always

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
will so the masking move was always

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:59.089 
will so the masking move was always
always<00:02:48.700> fun<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.390> always<00:02:49.599> different<00:02:49.780> color<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.619 

it's<00:03:00.099> a<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.430> bit<00:03:00.610> more<00:03:01.120> difficult<00:03:01.510> when

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
it's a little bit more difficult when

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.550 
it's a little bit more difficult when
you<00:03:01.750> don't<00:03:01.780> get<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> good<00:03:02.739> spread<00:03:03.180> upon<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you don't get a good spread upon the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.630 
you don't get a good spread upon the
surfaces<00:03:05.560> because<00:03:05.950> then<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.220> plastidip

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
surfaces because then the plastidip

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.420 
surfaces because then the plastidip
won't<00:03:06.819> peel<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.319> though<00:03:08.319> my<00:03:08.470> window<00:03:08.799> is<00:03:08.980> kind

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
won't peel off though my window is kind

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.309 
won't peel off though my window is kind
of<00:03:09.519> still<00:03:09.819> wet<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.810> wouldn't<00:03:11.019> peel<00:03:11.200> off

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
of still wet so it wouldn't peel off

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.099 
of still wet so it wouldn't peel off
very<00:03:11.560> well<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.950> did<00:03:12.400> wait<00:03:12.609> about<00:03:12.879> 15<00:03:13.450> 20<00:03:13.840> minutes

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
very well I did wait about 15 20 minutes

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.099 
very well I did wait about 15 20 minutes
to<00:03:14.440> feel<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:14.950> after<00:03:15.280> my<00:03:15.370> fourth<00:03:15.609> coat<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
to feel it after my fourth coat yeah I

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.569 
to feel it after my fourth coat yeah I
totally<00:03:20.409> masked<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.950> mirror<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.370> wouldn't

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
totally masked the mirror so I wouldn't

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:30.240 
totally masked the mirror so I wouldn't
get<00:03:21.670> any<00:03:21.879> on<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> mirror<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:29.250> more

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
get any on the mirror it's more

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.509 
get any on the mirror it's more
difficult<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.849> this<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.459> is

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
difficult like this because this is

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.430 
difficult like this because this is
underneath<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.510> everything<00:03:35.230> because

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
underneath and everything because

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.500 
underneath and everything because
normally<00:03:35.739> I'm<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:35.859> normally<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:37.239> doing<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
normally I'm just normally just doing a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.440 
normally I'm just normally just doing a
flat<00:03:37.720> surface<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.560> pretty<00:03:38.980> easy

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
flat surface so it's a pretty easy

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.039 
flat surface so it's a pretty easy
take<00:03:40.450> off<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:41.010> painters<00:03:42.010> tape<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:43.049> your

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
and it's a little bit more difficult and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.050 
and it's a little bit more difficult and
when<00:04:30.480> we<00:04:30.570> want<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.840> pull<00:04:31.020> away<00:04:31.140> from<00:04:31.940> where<00:04:32.940> you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
when we want to pull away from where you

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.930 
when we want to pull away from where you
want<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.540> plastic<00:04:34.140> actually<00:04:34.350> adhesive<00:04:35.160> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
want that plastic actually adhesive so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.920 
want that plastic actually adhesive so
it<00:04:36.000> creates<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> good<00:04:36.540> brake<00:04:37.140> line<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:39.750> this

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
it creates a good brake line and so this

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.750 
it creates a good brake line and so this
is<00:04:40.080> actually<00:04:40.710> working<00:04:40.860> out<00:04:41.010> really<00:04:41.250> well<00:04:41.340> just
