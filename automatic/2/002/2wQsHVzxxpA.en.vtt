00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello to you all again phoenix and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.940
 today I wanted to show you how you can 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.030
 defend or attack for ce 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 on the street in the first place where you can jump 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.740
 to a point here here up all 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.970
 probably know how to do it we 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 we jump and jump 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 jumped in here took theirs so 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 leaned out a little look if there 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.200
 but the one that sometimes happens 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.969
 becomes here and if there is killed 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.940
 thereafter 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.629
 If nothing still here is how 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 here here here we can go and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.890
 see this one here . 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.129
 advance slightly and see this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.850
 point though we stand far but this is already 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.280
 if the opponent on my are standing there this 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 after that if someone does not know you 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 without a jump here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.580
 jump down without from such a cap you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.259
 you can just take it from here and go down 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:20.009
 so less noise and output will be immediately 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.770
 stand on the roof without any jumping if 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.670
 you have not killed anyone then you will be able to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.570
 look here for you 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.570
 opponents if you are not there then we 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.509
 calmly we can already go down here and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 This is how it falls and see if anyone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.970
 here only this can be done with 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.659
 gun as it will be more difficult 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:52.159
 this is 1. and when will we leave here 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.750
 we immediately check this one corner 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.329
 go we go out already bummed away 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.399
 well as you can to stand here on this 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 point so when are we going from here 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.530
 go out he killed us and about this about it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.250
 place, too, do not forget the outside and here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.680
 we look at the check place someone else is 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.959
 question yet 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.640
 tim it so that it suits us here 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.359
 here we stand 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.989
 we stick out here and shoot him this 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:25.930
 also so small flies but when we have it 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.719
 killed and there lies smok 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 dik default we climb on these 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:36.930
 containers containers and here we stand 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.329
 We look first closer to nines and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.189
 the main thing is that no one came out here 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.950
 if there's nobody there we jump and 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:49.419
 We look from the nine itself there, too, no one 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.200
 no we go further as far as possible 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.560
 defend 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.109
 if you know that you will be standing in the hangar 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.840
 not here vylazit can be displayed as 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:08.439
 and here and immediately bit bezha with rep 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 here to jump and climb here, but here 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.560
 this point by the way it is. good because 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.979
 we see the opponent if he stands behind 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.879
 here is this box so use 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:24.489
 this point she needs me helps on 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.129
 can not lean ul but it's already dangerous 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.639
 . so they can take us out of here if you 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.930
 certainly not kill the enemy well, 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:37.959
 last one . 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.389
 Street is here such here for you 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.509
 counter-terrorists can just over here 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:47.109
 you go and 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:51.370
 jump on the railing and jump like that 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.030
 here is not jump on their roof for a long time
