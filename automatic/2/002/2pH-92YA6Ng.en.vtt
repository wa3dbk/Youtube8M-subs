left-hand side we have a Neilsen Donna

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
left-hand side we have a Neilsen Donna
which<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.800> okay<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.160> task<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.879> not

perfect little difficult to set

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
perfect little difficult to set
accurately<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.940> fix<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.899> up

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
accurately but I'm going to fix that up

accurately but I'm going to fix that up
and<00:00:58.399> sort<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.390> right-hand<00:01:01.079> side

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and sort that out on the right-hand side

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.209 
and sort that out on the right-hand side
and<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> tailstock

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and the tailstock

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.899 
and the tailstock
and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.030> colored<00:01:03.960> closer

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
and I have a little colored closer

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
and I have a little colored closer
Forster<00:01:05.909> color<00:01:06.119> closer<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> lever

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Forster color closer with a lever

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.980 
Forster color closer with a lever
attached<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.990> helps<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.200> lock<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
attached to it that helps me lock up the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
attached to it that helps me lock up the
case<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.869> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> de<00:01:16.140> bas<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:18.229> inside

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
case in the in the de bas is the inside

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
case in the in the de bas is the inside
of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.729> color<00:01:20.729> closer<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.270> allows<00:01:21.570> for

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the color closer which allows for

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.219 
of the color closer which allows for
various<00:01:22.140> diameter<00:01:22.799> case<00:01:23.610> hits<00:01:24.200> here<00:01:25.200> in

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
various diameter case hits here in

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.179 
various diameter case hits here in
operation<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> case<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.840> simply

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
operation to put a case in you simply

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.200 
operation to put a case in you simply
insert<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.250> okay<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.270> lock<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.710> this

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
insert it okay and lock it up like this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
insert it okay and lock it up like this
with<00:01:33.409> they<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.799> first<00:01:35.100> turn<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
with they don't we first turn the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.830 
with they don't we first turn the
coolant

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.789 

which<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> much<00:01:45.430> kakouton<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.540> really<00:01:47.140> does

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
which is a much kakouton and really does

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.969 
which is a much kakouton and really does
a<00:01:47.829> great<00:01:48.100> job<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.850> applying<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.540> area<00:01:50.170> and

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
a great job of is applying to area and

time sister lays on and you will see now

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
time sister lays on and you will see now
how<00:01:58.570> easy<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.310> keep<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.880> case

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
how easy it is to just keep this case

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:16.450 
how easy it is to just keep this case
onto<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.920> mandrel

once<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.790> reckon<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.150> should<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.540> measure<00:02:22.019> it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
once I reckon I should just measure it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.710 
once I reckon I should just measure it
stick<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.739> make<00:02:22.920> services<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> is
