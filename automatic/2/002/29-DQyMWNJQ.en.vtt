and then of course the AC adapter to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.679 
and then of course the AC adapter to
power<00:02:40.519> everything<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.239> that's<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> way

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
power everything so that's the way

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.690 
power everything so that's the way
everything<00:02:42.049> works<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.859> can<00:02:42.950> see<00:02:43.159> here<00:02:43.430> how<00:02:43.549> it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
everything works you can see here how it

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.759 
everything works you can see here how it
pivots<00:02:44.060> depending<00:02:44.540> upon<00:02:44.629> how<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:45.409> want<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.650> go

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
pivots depending upon how you want to go

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.610 
pivots depending upon how you want to go
ahead<00:02:45.859> and<00:02:46.069> angle<00:02:46.400> your<00:02:46.959> laptop<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.379> we'll<00:02:48.500> go

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
ahead and angle your laptop so we'll go

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.559 
ahead and angle your laptop so we'll go
ahead<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.950> put<00:02:49.129> this<00:02:49.280> here<00:02:49.669> and<00:02:50.120> we'll<00:02:50.359> place

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
ahead and put this here and we'll place

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.490 
ahead and put this here and we'll place
a<00:02:50.870> laptop<00:02:52.629> into<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.689> stand<00:02:53.989> real<00:02:54.230> quick<00:02:56.439> ok<00:02:57.439> so

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
a laptop into the stand real quick ok so

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.819 
a laptop into the stand real quick ok so
this<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.489> case<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:59.230> the<00:03:00.230> laptop<00:03:00.409> that's

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
this in this case is the laptop that's

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.349 
this in this case is the laptop that's
placed<00:03:01.069> here<00:03:01.459> we'll<00:03:01.579> probably<00:03:01.730> go<00:03:02.000> back<00:03:02.150> here

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
placed here we'll probably go back here

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.000 
placed here we'll probably go back here
a<00:03:02.419> little<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:02.780> see<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.079> fully<00:03:03.379> but<00:03:03.620> it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
a little bit to see it fully but it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.309 
a little bit to see it fully but it
elevates<00:03:04.400> up<00:03:04.669> the<00:03:05.120> as<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.599> can<00:03:05.750> see<00:03:05.959> the

elevates up the as you can see the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.470 
elevates up the as you can see the
screen<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:07.700> can<00:03:07.819> change<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.209> angle

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
screen and you can change the angle

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.000 
screen and you can change the angle
depending<00:03:08.780> upon<00:03:08.840> how<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.109> want<00:03:09.469> that<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:09.919> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
depending upon how you want that and it
