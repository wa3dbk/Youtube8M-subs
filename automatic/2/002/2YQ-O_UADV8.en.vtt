00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 about the queue building participants from 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.839
 Maxim Fadeev's teams 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.830
 Here is its composition. It is the scheme of the Khanagyan Julia. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 brat and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.200
 Igor jackets Meet 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.290
 I constantly miss me every day until 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.740
 this saw his son saw his wife 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.960
 here they were near I played with him what else 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.240
 It is well clear of course I miss the music 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.869
 it is such a thing that cannot be on 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.989
 background 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 and if you do music you owe 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.410
 have to do now split up 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.989
 shut down 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 one moment happened what I was all about 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.700
 I only dreamed that I played with the piano 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.129
 because I have never seen before 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 current who is there will not correct only a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.290
 it is not a sharp apogee that I know why 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.430
 so did but it was very cool with already 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.040
 there is a cool clip 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.949
 You can skip this youtube post 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.160
 with whom do we match those 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.790
 get nice and those who do not have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 by oneself 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.800
 Well, here is how the viewer will judge 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.140
 everything was actually very simple 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.910
 when we chose songs for the quarter-finals 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.910
 jackets you sing the sun light 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.969
 we all chose a quarter-final song 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.490
 Oleg Nekrasov all the time is 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.340

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.819

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:34.849
 supports it is always somewhere near i 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.849
 I'm afraid to let down my mentor 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.380
 all worms 2 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.380

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 bright winds 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.319

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.120
 Igor well done 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.690
 and we will know our opinion 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.970
 professional mentors because 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.550
 I look at the voltera 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.750
 he doesnâ€™t think much about him 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.740
 liked sang well 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.240
 bravo here right in the beginning it was clear 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.310
 vocal-produced by Max and 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.100
 here is this voice vision 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.040
 but of course probably not a little time 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.750
 enough to bring it to now able 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.880
 that is, then not much less 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.220
 I liked such a little student 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.350
 the number turned out although in general the total 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.400
 good feeling 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:58.490
 thanks for very sincerely sung sincerely 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.810
 trembling that is it that with regards to 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:05.840
 good but painfully insecure too 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.260
 no not sure this is somehow so ingratiating 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.990
 something like this was not enough for some man 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:17.000
 still saw component can you at least 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.890
 and young but still a man because I'm not 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.690
 it will turn out differently 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.850
 Actually, I also know that he can 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.310
 more, but for some reason, now 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.890
 times ivy 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.650
 I understand why I feel nervous 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.860
 maybe nerves yes but what he sang 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.550
 sincere it is yes well it is further 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.200
 what the guys said agree with them 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.150
 Next Maxim will be two more beautiful 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.100
 member of your team then and 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.230
 summarize and yet see off Igor 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.120

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.140
