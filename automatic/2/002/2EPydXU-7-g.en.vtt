00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.159 

now<00:00:01.550> when<00:00:01.880> you're<00:00:02.090> working<00:00:02.240> with<00:00:02.629> the<00:00:02.840> smaller

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:03.169 
now when you're working with the smaller

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.320 
now when you're working with the smaller
wire<00:00:04.000> sometimes<00:00:05.000> it's<00:00:05.210> a<00:00:05.299> little

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
wire sometimes it's a little

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.480 
wire sometimes it's a little
loosey-goosey<00:00:06.020> so<00:00:06.650> you're<00:00:06.859> going<00:00:07.129> to<00:00:07.220> want<00:00:07.370> to

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
loosey-goosey so you're going to want to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.430 
loosey-goosey so you're going to want to
pinch<00:00:08.210> it<00:00:08.389> again<00:00:09.170> and<00:00:09.700> every<00:00:10.700> now<00:00:10.849> and<00:00:11.090> then

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
pinch it again and every now and then

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.169 
pinch it again and every now and then
when<00:00:12.440> I'm<00:00:12.590> pinching<00:00:13.009> tightly<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.940> wire

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
when I'm pinching tightly the wire

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.510 
when I'm pinching tightly the wire
breaks<00:00:14.599> if<00:00:14.900> that<00:00:15.410> happens<00:00:15.589> don't<00:00:16.040> worry<00:00:16.160> about

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
breaks if that happens don't worry about

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.540 
breaks if that happens don't worry about
it<00:00:16.699> just<00:00:16.850> trim<00:00:17.420> it<00:00:17.740> rehook<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.010> pinch<00:00:19.430> it

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
it just trim it rehook and pinch it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.910 
it just trim it rehook and pinch it
again<00:00:19.820> and<00:00:20.090> you're<00:00:20.300> ready<00:00:20.510> to<00:00:20.689> move<00:00:20.840> on<00:00:21.020> so

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
again and you're ready to move on so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.769 
again and you're ready to move on so
that's<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.340> wire<00:00:22.520> joining<00:00:23.090> technique<00:00:23.480> just

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
that's the wire joining technique just

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.509 
that's the wire joining technique just
remember<00:00:24.109> hook<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:24.500> pinch<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.010> you're<00:00:25.250> good

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
remember hook and pinch and you're good

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.800 
remember hook and pinch and you're good
to<00:00:25.550> go<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:25.789> can<00:00:25.970> join<00:00:26.150> anything<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:26.779> that

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
to go you can join anything with that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.919 
to go you can join anything with that
method<00:00:27.189> so<00:00:28.189> let's<00:00:28.400> go<00:00:28.550> ahead<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.150> take<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.599> look

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
method so let's go ahead and take a look

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.420 
method so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:00:30.130> this<00:00:31.130> bra<00:00:31.490> structure<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:32.300> like<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:33.260> said

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
at this bra structure and like I said

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.680 
at this bra structure and like I said
we're<00:00:34.430> going<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.610> be<00:00:34.730> thinking<00:00:35.090> about<00:00:35.390> I've

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
we're going to be thinking about I've

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.060 
we're going to be thinking about I've
already<00:00:35.809> determined<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.440> size<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:36.860> want<00:00:36.950> to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
already determined the size I want to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.459 
already determined the size I want to
make<00:00:37.190> it<00:00:37.309> about<00:00:37.489> yay<00:00:38.030> big<00:00:38.110> but<00:00:39.110> we're<00:00:39.290> going<00:00:39.379> to

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
make it about yay big but we're going to

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.590 
make it about yay big but we're going to
use<00:00:39.770> certain<00:00:40.640> shapes<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.270> make<00:00:41.300> this

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
use certain shapes to make this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.970 
use certain shapes to make this
structure<00:00:42.020> we've<00:00:42.170> got<00:00:42.320> an<00:00:42.410> oval<00:00:42.770> at<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
structure we've got an oval at the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.119 
structure we've got an oval at the
bottom<00:00:43.360> triangles<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.570> rectangles<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:46.070> I'm

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
bottom triangles and rectangles so I'm

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.430 
bottom triangles and rectangles so I'm
going<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.340> start<00:00:46.460> by<00:00:47.210> creating<00:00:47.510> an<00:00:47.930> oval<00:00:48.410> for

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
going to start by creating an oval for

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.529 
going to start by creating an oval for
that<00:00:48.770> band<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.340> goes<00:00:49.610> around<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.030> bottom<00:00:50.390> of

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
that band that goes around the bottom of

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.069 
that band that goes around the bottom of
the<00:00:50.660> bra<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:52.010> make<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.430> I<00:00:52.640> need<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.079> wire

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
the bra and to make that I need to wire

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.920 
the bra and to make that I need to wire
circles<00:00:54.800> or<00:00:55.039> ovals<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.329> I've<00:00:56.480> done<00:00:56.719> that

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
circles or ovals so I've done that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.060 
circles or ovals so I've done that
already<00:00:57.730> by<00:00:58.730> creating<00:00:59.289> by<00:01:00.289> joining<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.859> two

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
already by creating by joining the two

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.069 
already by creating by joining the two
ends<00:01:01.460> together<00:01:01.609> like<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:02.270> demonstrated

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
ends together like I just demonstrated

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.890 
ends together like I just demonstrated
I've<00:01:03.230> got<00:01:03.440> two<00:01:03.770> ovals<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.909> as<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.720> can<00:01:05.869> see

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
I've got two ovals and as you can see

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.350 
I've got two ovals and as you can see
this<00:01:06.290> wire<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.619> very<00:01:07.220> bent<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.909> kind<00:01:08.299> of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
this wire is very bent and kind of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.480 
this wire is very bent and kind of
tricky<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.750> work<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:08.930> don't<00:01:09.890> worry<00:01:10.189> about

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
tricky to work with don't worry about

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.039 
tricky to work with don't worry about
that<00:01:10.760> because<00:01:10.970> we're<00:01:11.299> going<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.510> add<00:01:11.630> support

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
that because we're going to add support

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.760 
that because we're going to add support
to<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.070> by<00:01:13.670> adding<00:01:13.880> support<00:01:14.770> we're

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
to that and by adding support we're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.380 
to that and by adding support we're
going<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.979> make<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.159> thing<00:01:16.580> stand<00:01:16.790> up<00:01:17.180> nice

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
going to make this thing stand up nice

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.460 
going to make this thing stand up nice
and<00:01:17.450> firm<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.950> I've<00:01:19.310> cut<00:01:20.200> probably<00:01:21.200> about<00:01:21.409> I

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
and firm so I've cut probably about I

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.850 
and firm so I've cut probably about I
usually<00:01:22.070> cut<00:01:22.280> about<00:01:22.490> 15<00:01:23.030> pieces<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.810> wire<00:01:24.080> to

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
usually cut about 15 pieces of wire to

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.890 
usually cut about 15 pieces of wire to
create<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.220> support<00:01:25.850> that's<00:01:26.119> going<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.390> go<00:01:26.570> from

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
create a support that's going to go from

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.520 
create a support that's going to go from
the<00:01:27.049> top<00:01:27.080> piece<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.520> bottom<00:01:28.909> piece<00:01:29.530> so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the top piece to the bottom piece so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.520 
the top piece to the bottom piece so
let's<00:01:30.799> start<00:01:31.100> by<00:01:31.450> doing<00:01:32.450> our<00:01:32.750> first<00:01:33.020> support

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
let's start by doing our first support

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.149 
let's start by doing our first support
I'm<00:01:34.220> going<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.670> create<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:35.240> hook<00:01:35.570> at<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.500> end<00:01:36.680> of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
I'm going to create a hook at the end of

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.760 
I'm going to create a hook at the end of
this<00:01:37.549> wire<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.299> it's<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.930> pretty<00:01:39.140> small<00:01:39.290> hook

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
this wire and it's a pretty small hook

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.640 
this wire and it's a pretty small hook
but<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.000> simple<00:01:41.360> curve<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:41.990> wire<00:01:42.290> and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
but just a simple curve of the wire and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.600 
but just a simple curve of the wire and
we're<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.579> join<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> really

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
we're going to join it this is really

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.310 
we're going to join it this is really
bending<00:01:46.610> kind<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.970> silly<00:01:47.180> here<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.049> let's<00:01:48.259> not

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
bending kind of silly here but let's not

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.510 
bending kind of silly here but let's not
worry<00:01:48.530> about<00:01:48.649> it<00:01:48.950> we're<00:01:49.100> not<00:01:49.189> going<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.399> worry

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
worry about it we're not going to worry

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.980 
worry about it we're not going to worry
about<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:49.840> I'm<00:01:50.840> going<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.170> join<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:53.240> hook<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
about it I'm going to join that hook to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.950 
about it I'm going to join that hook to
the<00:01:54.110> wire<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.000> hold<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.210> carefully<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.630> just

of it and I'm going to join it with the
other<00:02:18.049> oval<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:23.420> will<00:02:23.629> pinch<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:23.989> down<00:02:24.349> as
