00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.900
 hello and welcome that photo 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.630
 be horde for this great day 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.910
 this is the ideal time to test the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.380
 snapo and night so the snow poems 8 is 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.500
 a waterproof phone 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220
 he's hyper 68 they also resist 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.779
 shock 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.329
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.820
 immerse him and we'll let him down at 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.950
 about a height of 1 meter 70 on 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.649
 the ice to see how he resists 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.559
 shock 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.300
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.239
 take a little water to our photo 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.969
 first we'll be like that under 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:56.719
 the water and then we go now 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:01:00.199
 immerse it and we'll see if the video 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.760
 continues to read as he is 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.760
 so under water 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.240
 so in any case I see no bubble 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.310
 coming out of the smartphone it's pretty good 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 sign 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.550
 so I remind you that it is normally 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.140
 ip68 we saw in the first test which 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:38.590
 the O-ring is therefore waterproof at the level 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:41.350
 battery compartment we will see it 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.520
 go out now what are we going to do 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.380
 we're going to stop him and we're going here 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.930
 open the compartment left to see 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.509
 if he's really tight and who has not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.240
 at all humidity for example so 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:01.500
 here I opened the six screws now 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.500
 we will open the battery compartment 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 so what we see is that there is 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.400
 the water here on the side it looks like he 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.800
 there is no water in any case to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:31.850
 inside and here there is no water from 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:38.120
 all so to slightly water here at 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:40.580
 outside but it's very very weak 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.860
 so the phone in any case what 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 level and waterproof it must be well 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.959
 close also this is the compartment here 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.250
 usb and compartment here for 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.250
 the walkie talkie antenna 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.360
 so that's it still works 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.940
 we will go to the next test which is the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.290
 fall resistance test 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.709
 so now what are we going to do is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.330
 that measure 1 meter 80 we will let go here 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.170
 around 1 meter 70 on the floor 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.690
 here that extends into granite and we'll see a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.760
 psy and resists falling 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.770
 so I hope the cameraman has to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.770
 to be able to follow the fall so a two 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.770
 three 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.239
 so the video stopped but the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.469
 phone does not seem to have undergone 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.420
 problem so be it's deal 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:58.629
 we're going to do a reset here and we're going to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.629
 revive 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.910
 and so they dread without problem 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.120
 we will wait in the rain that it is 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.120
 completely boutet 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.210
 So here is the smartphone has gone 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.500
 I dried the screen and as we see 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.319
 it works perfectly when the screen 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.520
 is wet he has a little bit of trouble 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.039
 to work what to see also 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.319
 is that I left the protective film 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:44.870
 of the frozen sinn well examine it has a 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.340
 any small scratch at this level 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.410
 high level he took the shock but that's 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.789
 you really have to look good 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.020
 because on the spot I really 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.030
 saw no scratches and so we 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.710
 can really say that the snow poems 8 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.569
 is a phone that resists shocks 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.569
 and what's really waterproof
