00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.330
 cowcotland today announced seizure on Thursday and you are on the morning 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 and now here is the n2 today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.770
 You know that I love you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.679
 p 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.140
 v 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.430
 how this gentleman today by a site really nice and that will please 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.670
 surely to all those who have always dreamed of becoming a star 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 and this time the tarmac is simply a site that allows you to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.450
 create your pretty face 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.650
 instead of the faces of your favorite stars dubbed the scubster movie 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.340
 in the hand of great works of art 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 but I have necessarily chosen the post of a mini-film to be preferred and that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.960
 gave that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.660
 you say what me it made me laugh 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.100
 what would I have loved to embody Beatrice living in this crime 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.160
 at the meeting since January 17th 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.850
 do you remember the next special the new pole good 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.620
 for those who missed it you can always see it through the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 archives anyway 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.960
 what interests us here in fact was the part the google offices 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.460
 not what the pt and camila share that the locals are really amazing 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.909
 until now and for years the box pay the little Belgian 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.230
 the dish of the day and dinner has its employees and not even a bowl for them 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 all this m 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830
 cap finished and tac 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.950
 l appreciate it outright been contacted to prevent that google 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.260
 start saving money on food 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.490
 result apple dinner techniques for everyone 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.190
 but hey his share they still have nothing to complain about either 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.740
 dexter will continue to be entitled to other meals 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.159
 so they will not starve so why this suppression of 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:40.920
 privileges 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.510
 Well, the official reason is the expert contractor of 'Basel appetite 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.830
 was unhappy with how his own employees of the four were 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.160
 treaties 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.020
 he also says that the best chefs are gone gp another 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.690
 so race result 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.800
 not enough staff to offer as many meals and especially not want to 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.840
 shell out more sub to mitigate while this story goes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.410
 still against the system of piles of gala mud that always said 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.930
 that it was smarter to save 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 providing employees with good health for better productivity 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.980
 oran so the other day reminded bourgeois not go basketball places 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.170
 you know the super dirty linen baskets told you automatically 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.519
 but to continue in the section how to clean up and have fun 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.329
 saving the most time and energy possible 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.459
 this is what I called he left the remote controlled land afterwards as 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.859
 you see it on the picture this is briefcase the lingering these cyber system 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.310
 has just stopped his fight, that is to say his aspiration on board 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.810
 to be able to tap on his wii while sucking it worries me frankly 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.620
 it's hardly lost your politics so impressed me frankly I told them 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.410
 not say better when it comes to reconciling video game enthusiasts 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.119
 with household chores 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.840
 plus it's good for testing 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.480
 since we are finally doing it a bit of sport hand allawi 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.000
 for those who would be tempted to do the same at home watch the video 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.419
 in its entirety everything is explained here now is the turn 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.109
 today a few days ago 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.129
 then we've lost a man who is told that an extension of flowers 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.479
 will look more like a battlefield in the middle of the war because others 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.549
 things this contact has bigger thing and actually go it works a little bit 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.039
 banal like a grenade launcher indeed the idea is that the small machine 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:25.199
 swing grenades from his hosts in the flames just then these 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.309
 quotas the idea because much less dangerous than conventional fire extinguishers 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.450
 as we will surely have to get closer to the flames to fight 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.559
 fire 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.079
 the other side is all the fire extinguishers was a day like that 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.650
 the sporting paternity gap was France had notably realized taxi 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.630
 for example 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.470
 to leave something like this within the reach of children I do not know too much 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.210
 if it's a good idea in the head we're not here it's all for 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.200
 today I leave you with a video that demonstrates rather well that it 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.030
 must treat our small machines it's true that it's useless for them 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.779
 son and team colors call plants 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.999
 and then we never know how they can react you'll see 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.999
 at the eco-museum tomorrow 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
 % 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.360
 carnival
