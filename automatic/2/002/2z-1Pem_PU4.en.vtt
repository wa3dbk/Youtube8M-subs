00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.260
 are the patients looking for us in relation to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.700
 the withdrawal of the maggi statue by several 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.760
 reasons to know is the change of profession 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:22.189
 there is repentance for is the language 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.070
 by the person is repentance 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:32.969
 in relation to loving relationships 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.219
 change then in relation to the colors we 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.140
 we know that the darker tattoo 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.660
 often it takes a smaller number of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 sessions and some collaborations such as 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 yellow example a very difficult tattoo 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.640
 to remove red we have a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:55.170
 difficulty also without us we see 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.800
 logical we do not have a whole universe 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.149
 of patients who perform this tattoo 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 our universe of people just that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.799
 seek help that I would like 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.450
 make it clear that the house staff 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.280
 that removing the tattoo is not a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 simple procedure if to make a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.520
 simple procedure today to remove 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 It's not even the whole tattoo is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
 completely reversible 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 there are some cases that for more sessions 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 we do we have difficulty 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 remove the pigment another situation 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.299
 which is more common still and we had there 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.630
 the copying pigment 90% and still 10% are 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630
 resistant 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.899
 he has a little pain but usually 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 is a bearable pain with anesthetic 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.920
 place in cream are usually well 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.920
 tolerable procedure 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.720
 the procedure is not normally a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.890
 procedure has taken time to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.149
 few minutes 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.189
 now with regard to the number of 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.960
 applications is very variable 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.600
 there are cases with two sessions 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.450
 man there are cases you will need 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.739
 dozens of sessions or many months 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.620
 of treatment 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.239
 so it's really worth it if you go 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.160
 to have a tattoo evaluate all this 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.140
 colors question when accessed how many is 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.060
 ice globar figure in relation to this 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.030
 regions of the body or is important 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.620
 emphasize some regions have greater 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.670
 in some regions of greater 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.060
 difficulty 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 so are we here willing to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.920
 spend solving this problem 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.600
 eventually, which is very high and can 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.230
 become a problem that this issue 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 of tattoo
