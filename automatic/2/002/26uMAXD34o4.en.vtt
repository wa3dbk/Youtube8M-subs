in<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.280> particular<00:01:44.790> case<00:01:45.000> we've<00:01:45.479> taken<00:01:45.950> some

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
in this particular case we've taken some

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
in this particular case we've taken some
of<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.280> wire<00:01:47.670> collars<00:01:48.210> several<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> them

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
of these wire collars several of them

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
of these wire collars several of them
and<00:01:49.049> we've<00:01:49.409> extended<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.280> through<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and we've extended it down through a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.990 
and we've extended it down through a
column<00:01:51.570> through<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> glass<00:01:52.829> column<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> also

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
column through a glass column and also

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
column through a glass column and also
placed<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> top<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> we're<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
placed it on the top and we're going to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
placed it on the top and we're going to
make<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> another<00:01:57.420> floral<00:01:57.990> product<00:01:58.560> by

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
make use of another floral product by

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.719 
make use of another floral product by
the<00:01:59.100> folks<00:01:59.490> at<00:01:59.700> Oasis<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> foam<00:02:01.320> spheres

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the folks at Oasis the foam spheres

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
the folks at Oasis the foam spheres
because<00:02:02.729> once<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.600> infrastructure

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
because once we have this infrastructure

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
because once we have this infrastructure
in<00:02:04.560> place<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.189> take<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> foam<00:02:05.700> sphere<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
in place we can take a foam sphere and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
in place we can take a foam sphere and
we<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.719> place<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.039> that's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
we can place it in here and that's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.460 
we can place it in here and that's
exactly<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:09.330> we're<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.899> because

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
exactly what we're going to do because

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.700 
exactly what we're going to do because
look<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.030> lo<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.050> behold

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
look I can take this lo and behold

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.550 
look I can take this lo and behold
10<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> foam<00:02:14.220> sphere<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.880> place<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.960> over<00:02:16.110> on

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
10 a foam sphere and place it over on

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
10 a foam sphere and place it over on
here<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.220> look<00:02:17.940> quick<00:02:18.950> easy<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.520> we<00:02:21.180> come<00:02:21.420> up

here and look quick easy and we come up

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.300 
here and look quick easy and we come up
with<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.050> great<00:02:22.440> look

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
with a great look

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
with a great look
isn't<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> amazing<00:02:24.600> isn't<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.260> amazing

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
isn't that amazing isn't that amazing

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.010 
isn't that amazing isn't that amazing
just<00:02:26.550> based<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:28.110> column<00:02:29.060> based<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.690> wire

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
just based on a column based on our wire

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.410 
just based on a column based on our wire
and<00:02:32.240> based<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.500> foam<00:02:34.500> sphere<00:02:35.270> isn't<00:02:36.270> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and based on foam sphere isn't that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740 
and based on foam sphere isn't that
amazing<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.700> we're<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.330> stop<00:02:39.540> with

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
amazing but we're not going to stop with

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.390 
amazing but we're not going to stop with
one<00:02:39.960> no<00:02:40.920> today's<00:02:41.640> look<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.090> modular<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.370> be

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
one no today's look is modular to can be

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
one no today's look is modular to can be
better<00:02:44.670> than<00:02:44.940> one

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
better than one

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
better than one
so<00:02:46.020> here<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:47.100> second<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:48.470> but<00:02:49.470> wait<00:02:49.770> there's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
so here is a second one but wait there's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.620 
so here is a second one but wait there's

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
these things together and the thing will

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.210 
these things together and the thing will
feel<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.510> some<00:05:12.810> sort<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.140> giant<00:05:13.380> erector<00:05:13.770> set

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
feel like some sort of giant erector set

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.820 
feel like some sort of giant erector set
by<00:05:14.850> taking<00:05:15.300> some<00:05:15.540> of<00:05:15.570> our<00:05:15.750> bamboo<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.530> having

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
by taking some of our bamboo and having

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.010 
by taking some of our bamboo and having
things<00:05:17.010> going<00:05:17.400> from<00:05:17.640> one<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:18.120> another<00:05:18.150> now<00:05:18.900> I'm

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
things going from one to another now I'm

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.080 
things going from one to another now I'm
just<00:05:19.200> placing<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.800> here<00:05:19.830> my<00:05:20.250> viewer<00:05:20.520> but<00:05:21.060> I

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
just placing it here my viewer but I

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.810 
just placing it here my viewer but I
could<00:05:21.390> easily<00:05:21.870> just<00:05:22.170> take<00:05:22.590> this<00:05:22.770> push<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.400> into

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
could easily just take this push it into

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.360 
could easily just take this push it into
my<00:05:24.480> foam<00:05:24.750> sphere<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.380> then<00:05:25.590> push<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.100> here

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
my foam sphere and then push it in here

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.100 
my foam sphere and then push it in here
so<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:26.760> can<00:05:26.880> have<00:05:27.060> this<00:05:27.240> coming<00:05:27.960> up

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
so that we can have this coming up

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.290 
so that we can have this coming up
looking<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:28.800> some<00:05:28.950> sort<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.610> Kabbalistic

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
looking like some sort of a Kabbalistic

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.570 
looking like some sort of a Kabbalistic
weirdness<00:05:31.140> in<00:05:31.350> terms<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.890> things<00:05:32.160> all<00:05:32.550> over

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
weirdness in terms of things all over

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.910 
weirdness in terms of things all over
the<00:05:32.880> place<00:05:32.970> criss<00:05:33.480> crossing<00:05:33.780> so<00:05:34.440> we<00:05:34.590> can<00:05:34.770> do

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
the place criss crossing so we can do

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.770 
the place criss crossing so we can do
things<00:05:35.130> like<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.640> as<00:05:35.820> well<00:05:35.850> when<00:05:36.630> we're

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
things like that as well when we're
