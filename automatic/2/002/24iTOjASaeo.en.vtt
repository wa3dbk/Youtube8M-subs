00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.430
 water, essential element for life 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.240
 in industrialized countries in most of which water seems 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.099
 flow inexhaustibly 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.170
 It is not easy to get an idea of ​​the extent to which water is important 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.329
 for the development the health and peace of human beings 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.210
 however in many regions of the world 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 water is a scarce commodity in many cases human beings do not even 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 they still have access enough to drink water, children are the main 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.829
 affected every day about six thousand children die in the world because of the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.740
 diarrhea and yet in this world 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.020
 there would have to be enough drinking water for left-handed people 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.240
 this is what one of the millennium development goals of 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.840
 the un now well 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 how to achieve this goal 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.550
 at the water research institute in zürich 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.600
 in the era federal agency pack for the purification supply and 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.100
 water protection 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.780
 a method has been developed that simply and sustainably transforms 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.640
 the contaminated water in drinking water 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 solbes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.270
 Sodi is a simple method to eliminate pathogens from 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.829
 Water 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.010
 and make it drinkable 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.650
 the sun's rays deactivate them tactilely and so the viruses that cause the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.130
 diarrhea p villegas two faults the sodis method 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.240
 does not need expensive fuels or other investments destined to 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.360
 water purification facilities 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 yes 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 In addition to pet bottles you also need a huge job 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.360
 explanatory and diffusion 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.120
 the Swiss agency for development and cooperation cosude in berna 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.630
 he also contributes to this project about him 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.590
 a club with what he realized when it comes to fighting poverty the water 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 is at the center of the problem 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.619
 more than one billion human beings have no access to water 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.149
 and those people who suffer water shortages are exclusively the poor 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.789
 therefore one of the main tasks of the cosude consists in the 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.969
 provisioning of drinking water 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.339
 before the beginning we have financially supported the research 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:24.669
 accused of going assumes a part of the financial rich linked to it and 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:28.999
 in a second phase together with our partners such as the one of apac 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.409
 we have contributed to the dissemination of the solís method mainly in countries 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.949
 Asians and Latin Americans polanski percent 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.679
 he harassed her from the stage 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:44.079
 has been able to verify in several pilot projects if there where 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.979
 arrived the sodis method is well received by the people affected and has 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.119
 greatly contributed to improving the health of the population 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.019
 also highlight santander 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.239
 in the couple 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.829
 despite getting close but they are highly suspect the advantage is for 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 you 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.649
 until then 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.259
 Barcelona 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.229
 4 before we had to boil the water to drink it 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.220
 now with the solís method until my child can prepare the amendments to the 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.629
 road 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.239
 cases of diarrhea have been reduced by 50% the sodis method demonstrates its 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.049
 effectiveness 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.099
 now 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.329
 once the solís method has already proven its effectiveness 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.539
 it's about testing it in as many places as possible on earth 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.519
 many millions of human beings could benefit from its application 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.759
 The challenge is to spread the correct application throughout the world 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.269
 the cosude philae apac 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.659
 they also participate in this mission 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.010
 and to be able to carry it out they receive important support from 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.839
 representatives of civil society 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.619
 for example the Swiss lions club 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.199
 This style has been mobilized throughout the country through its more than 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.769
 two hundred local representations 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.799
 To carry out a special campaign, the rating agency highlights the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.269
 the lion club is a service club whose currency is very close 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.400
 We have found that this project is an excellent idea, a pretty project 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.550
 simple but large-scale 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.490
 and taking into account climate warming 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.349
 The problem of water is a problem that affects practically everyone 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.740
 in this position we sell small bottles as well as a chest in progress 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.170
 we have set ourselves the goal of reaching 2 million francs in one day 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.689
 health ekiza 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.449
 millions of Japanese 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.949
 On this national campaign day, more than two million 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.860
 Swiss francs 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.610
 this money will go to spread the method only say other regions 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.639
 the sorís project shows how in switzerland the science organizations for 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.560
 the development 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.089
 and civil society 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.020
 they collaborate to help other human beings 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.620
 The goal of the UN is to get all the inhabitants of the earth 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.990
 have enough drinking water 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.800
 with the sodis method we have taken a step forward
