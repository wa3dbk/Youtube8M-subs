sorry<00:00:45.350> after<00:00:45.560> tire<00:00:45.740> rod<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.090> also<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.180> ball

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
sorry after tire rod and also the ball

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.900 
sorry after tire rod and also the ball
joint<00:00:47.830> on<00:00:48.830> this<00:00:49.010> ball<00:00:49.250> joint<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:49.640> actually

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
joint on this ball joint it's actually

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.670 
joint on this ball joint it's actually
easier<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.210> loosen<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> three<00:00:50.900> nuts<00:00:51.140> and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
easier to loosen the three nuts and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.830 
easier to loosen the three nuts and
bolts<00:00:52.100> that<00:00:52.220> hold<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:52.520> on<00:00:52.610> compared<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:53.720> the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
bolts that hold it on compared to the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.550 
bolts that hold it on compared to the
large<00:00:54.020> nut<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.090> more<00:00:56.270> access<00:00:56.600> then<00:00:57.500> we

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
large nut this is more access then we

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:15.139 
large nut this is more access then we
can<00:00:57.710> pop<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.980> driveshaft<00:00:58.190> off

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.670 

when<00:01:16.149> we<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> 3.7<00:01:17.170> back<00:01:17.350> from<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.530> ball

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
when we have the 3.7 back from the ball

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.639 
when we have the 3.7 back from the ball
joint<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.820> can<00:01:18.969> pull<00:01:19.180> out<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.500> ball

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
joint we can pull out on the ball

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:32.760 
joint we can pull out on the ball
assembly<00:01:21.270> give<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.360> driveshaft<00:01:22.600> guitar<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
assembly give the driveshaft guitar the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.649 
assembly give the driveshaft guitar the
next<00:01:33.009> thing<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.250> do<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.789> train<00:01:34.240> gearbox

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
next thing to do is to train gearbox

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.539 
next thing to do is to train gearbox
load<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.899> some<00:01:38.110> plugs<00:01:38.380> right<00:01:38.530> here<00:01:38.740> on<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
load so some plugs right here on the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.270 
load so some plugs right here on the
bottom<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.850> gearbox<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.710> remove<00:01:41.710> driveshaft

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
bottom the gearbox to remove driveshaft

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.919 
bottom the gearbox to remove driveshaft
from<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.149> gearbox<00:01:43.329> just<00:01:43.830> 3:13<00:01:44.830> Milt's<00:01:45.929> you

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
from the gearbox just 3:13 Milt's you

00:01:46.929 --> 00:02:10.139 
from the gearbox just 3:13 Milt's you
can<00:01:47.200> get<00:01:47.319> up<00:01:47.470> with<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.619> long<00:01:47.770> extension<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:10.000> we

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
can get up with a long extension when we

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.370 
can get up with a long extension when we
have<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.420> three<00:02:10.630> bolts<00:02:10.810> search<00:02:11.079> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
have the three bolts search the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.789 
have the three bolts search the
driveshaft<00:02:11.590> should<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.250> slide<00:02:12.430> off<00:02:13.799> very

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
driveshaft should just slide off very

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.710 
driveshaft should just slide off very
easy<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.359> put<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.569> side-by-side

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
easy then we can put it side-by-side

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.210 
easy then we can put it side-by-side
with<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> new<00:02:20.380> one<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.799> make<00:02:20.829> sure<00:02:20.950> it's

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
with the new one just to make sure it's

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.509 
with the new one just to make sure it's
exact<00:02:21.549> same<00:02:21.730> length<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:23.100> everything<00:02:24.100> lines

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
exact same length and everything lines

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.900 
exact same length and everything lines
up<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.880> same<00:02:25.060> way<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:26.139> one<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.410> correct<00:02:26.910> so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
up the same way this one is correct so

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.670 
up the same way this one is correct so
it's<00:02:28.480> pretty<00:02:28.840> much<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.109> reverse<00:02:29.500> operation

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
it's pretty much the reverse operation

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.460 
it's pretty much the reverse operation
to<00:02:30.130> put<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.340> back<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:32.019> should<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.260> simple

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
to put it back in it should be simple

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.270 
to put it back in it should be simple
and<00:02:32.739> will<00:02:33.310> chop<00:02:33.549> up<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.000> gearbox<00:02:34.450> oil<00:02:34.569> again

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and will chop up the gearbox oil again

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.670 
and will chop up the gearbox oil again
thanks<00:02:36.340> five
