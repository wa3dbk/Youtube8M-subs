edges will eventually become afraid and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.560 
edges will eventually become afraid and
it'll<00:01:54.369> just<00:01:54.549> start<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.820> kind<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:54.999> fall<00:01:55.179> apart

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570

edges done though you're going to want

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.740 
edges done though you're going to want
to<00:03:10.920> create<00:03:11.190> yourself<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.819> channel<00:03:12.209> on<00:03:12.359> each<00:03:12.569> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
to create yourself a channel on each of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.809 
to create yourself a channel on each of
the<00:03:12.840> short<00:03:13.079> ends<00:03:13.440> somewhere<00:03:14.040> between<00:03:14.340> two<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
the short ends somewhere between two and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.430 
the short ends somewhere between two and
three<00:03:15.060> inches<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.049> perfectly

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
three inches is going to be perfectly

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.550 
three inches is going to be perfectly
fine<00:03:17.540> next<00:03:18.540> you're<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.049> want<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.349> sew

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
fine next you're going to want to sew

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.880 
fine next you're going to want to sew
the<00:03:20.430> entire<00:03:20.819> channel<00:03:21.359> not<00:03:21.540> once<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:22.829> twice

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the entire channel not once not twice

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.449 
the entire channel not once not twice
but<00:03:23.220> three<00:03:24.150> total<00:03:24.959> times<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.890> reinforce<00:03:26.400> that

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
but three total times to reinforce that

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:46.570 
but three total times to reinforce that
hem

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.700 

now<00:03:47.580> there<00:03:47.850> are<00:03:48.060> lots<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.780> different<00:03:49.200> ways<00:03:49.320> in

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
now there are lots of different ways in

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.800 
now there are lots of different ways in
order<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.190> whip<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.210> of<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:51.450> hammock

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
order to whip the end of your hammock

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.530 
order to whip the end of your hammock
but<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.800> choose<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.760> keep<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.090> assembly<00:03:54.480> as

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
but I choose to just keep it assembly as

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.210 
but I choose to just keep it assembly as
possible<00:03:54.990> but<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.950> case<00:03:56.070> you're

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
possible but just in case you're

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.440 
possible but just in case you're
wondering<00:03:56.250> here's<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.760> couple<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.150> different

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
wondering here's a couple of different

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.870 
wondering here's a couple of different
ways<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.410> simply<00:03:58.830> hold<00:03:59.250> one<00:03:59.490> end<00:03:59.670> and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
ways you can simply hold one end and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.250 
ways you can simply hold one end and
begin<00:04:00.240> to<00:04:00.390> slowly<00:04:00.750> gather<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.770> material<00:04:02.310> onto

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
begin to slowly gather the material onto

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.830 
begin to slowly gather the material onto
itself<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:05.610> simply<00:04:05.820> wrap<00:04:06.270> your<00:04:06.540> cord

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
itself and you simply wrap your cord

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.380 
itself and you simply wrap your cord
around<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.500> end<00:04:07.710> of<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.640> fabric<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:09.090> hold<00:04:09.210> it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
around the end of the fabric to hold it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.950 
around the end of the fabric to hold it
in<00:04:09.480> place

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
in place

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.640 
in place
simple<00:04:10.500> enough<00:04:12.080> another<00:04:13.080> way<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.440> can

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
simple enough another way that you can

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.380 
simple enough another way that you can
do<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.550> begin<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:15.000> create

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
do it is you can begin to create

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.800 
do it is you can begin to create
basically<00:04:16.080> these<00:04:16.530> back<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.370> forth<00:04:17.780> back<00:04:18.780> and

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
basically these back and forth back and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.890 
basically these back and forth back and
forth<00:04:19.049> until<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:20.640> have<00:04:21.060> all<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.480> material

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
forth until you have all the material

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900 
forth until you have all the material
gathered<00:04:22.260> together<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.770> then<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.220> whip<00:04:23.430> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
gathered together and then you whip the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.160 
gathered together and then you whip the
end<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.630> material<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:27.170> yet

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
end of the material like that yet

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.130 
end of the material like that yet
another<00:04:28.380> way<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:29.150> basically<00:04:30.150> fold<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
another way is to basically fold the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.730 
another way is to basically fold the
material<00:04:31.230> in<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.220> itself<00:04:32.730> several<00:04:33.330> times

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
material in on itself several times

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.960 
material in on itself several times

through the channel that I had sown

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.730 
through the channel that I had sown
earlier<00:04:56.629> using<00:04:57.629> a<00:04:57.750> continuous<00:04:58.229> loop<00:04:58.530> and

there<00:05:27.470> are<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.680> couple<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:28.130> other<00:05:28.280> ways<00:05:28.460> that

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
there are a couple of other ways that

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.490

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
this will essentially cinch it up and
