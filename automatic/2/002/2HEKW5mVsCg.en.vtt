00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.150
 little more impressions of the selection 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.800
 national here we have both 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.450
 captains juan arango tomás corner east 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.920
 historical triumph in front of the national team 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.390
 of colombia that arrives thanks to insurance 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.150
 universitas we are your alternative 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.160
 we started with juan arango juan sixth 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.570
 america cup and go way to debut a 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.980
 historic triumph never serves has won 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.199
 in copa america america and never 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 he had won in the debut he is given that a 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.830
 new historical the age the team 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 showed a total delivery kept the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.739
 Calm had good standing in no time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 I think that causes us so much 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.290
 danger out there at the end then this one by 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.329
 the impetus of colombia for the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.000
 despair of Colombia because in the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.260
 pelotazos created us 12 times but 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.329
 I think that the clear occasions are 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 we had the eleven america cup 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.780
 Maltin Polar is a legend because 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.030
 we have a leading polar maltlin leader 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.309
 also inside the court you take how much 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.690
 sacrifice how much delivery but what 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.910
 I was talking now as orizola or the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.530
 level technical assistant month and everything 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.149
 what we have tried and prepared for 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.739
 time came out of the defensive movement and 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.600
 it's already here yes I think we've 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.710
 made a very correct match very 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.650
 organized 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.500
 we have not left space for the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.340
 players they referred to receive 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.100
 we have played a game with a lot 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 hierarchy and a lot of personality now not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.940
 now we have to keep our feet on 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.350
 the earth without much euphoria let the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.390
 people are the ones who enjoy it and we 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.460
 focus with with the match against 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.409
 Peru to try to secure the pass the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.360
 second with the juan movements as 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.009
 mediapunta there at the back of salo 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 down the sides and go ronald war 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.649
 but they are movements not only in the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.630
 attack but also to cover the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.070
 sides to shade the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.710
 players unbalancing them and 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.000
 obviously we were not only for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 attack but also to help in 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.390
 defense why the team 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.640
 I do not leave as much space as he said take us 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 let maneuver the players of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 quality of them 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.090
 and they had to choose the pitch 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.610
 where we are also strong in 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.530
 defense and out there they were complicated 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.450
 very much they got us space and that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.280
 it benefited us and that was what 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 What did you like most about the selection of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.989
 you take beyond the tactical 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.230
 I say the feeling is what leaves you 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.390
 this triumph look I liked that since 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.239
 before there was the game I saw a lot 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.260
 safety in my colleagues I think that 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.110
 many with the necessary experience to 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.280
 face this type of games also I 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.470
 I remain with the sacrifice and those above 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 to give a hand defense I think that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.640
 that was the key for the team 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.280
 it was compact and no no no let 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.870
 Much space surprises you the triumph 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.410
 as many who are surprised by the triumph 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 they are for us not there there was much 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.230
 much this not only from Colombia or from 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.569
 all of all South America but I think that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.440
 many of Venezuela did not give us 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.260
 we 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.510
 I think this is a demonstration of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 that we are on the right track 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.980
 that we are doing things well and 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.100
 that you have to follow a bad legend 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.420
 temporary or a polar maltlin leader and I 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
 I want to also take advantage of this moment 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.580
 for you to invite all 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.200
 venezuela that at the moment is 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.210
 charged euphoria as Tomás said corner 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.520
 that celebrate the people but that you have 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.050
