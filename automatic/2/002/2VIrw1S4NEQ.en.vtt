even<00:00:37.590> joke<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.820> taking<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.270> account

they<00:00:39.899> sweep<00:00:40.320> inside<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.910> whole<00:00:42.120> squad

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
they sweep inside but this whole squad

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.560 
they sweep inside but this whole squad
available<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> moment<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.329> with

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
available at the moment and I think with

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
available at the moment and I think with
the<00:00:45.719> Argentine<00:00:46.260> fact<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.010> should<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the Argentine fact that they should not

the Argentine fact that they should not
being<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> strongest<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> world<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.899> think

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
being the strongest in the world I think

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
being the strongest in the world I think
you<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.590> probably<00:00:49.829> expect<00:00:50.340> way<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you could probably expect way to have a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.569 
you could probably expect way to have a
big<00:00:51.420> strike<00:00:52.260> rating<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.860> game<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.280> wouldn't

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
big strike rating this game I wouldn't

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.130 
big strike rating this game I wouldn't
be<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.940> surprised<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.840> school

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
be at all surprised to see them school

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.920 
be at all surprised to see them school
at<00:00:55.500> least<00:00:55.920> two<00:00:56.160> tries<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.850> game<00:00:57.059> however

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
at least two tries in this game however

at least two tries in this game however
he<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.230> an<00:00:58.410> impact<00:00:58.649> offensively<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.460> well

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
he has an impact offensively as well

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
he has an impact offensively as well
because<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> reason<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.289> make

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
because the reason why he doesn't make

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.920 
because the reason why he doesn't make
the<00:01:01.559> regular<00:01:01.920> even<00:01:02.219> starting<00:01:02.640> 15<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.750> he

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the regular even starting 15 is that he

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
the regular even starting 15 is that he
is<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.379> great<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.890> defense<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.820> I've<00:01:06.060> teen<00:01:06.390> are

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
is not great in defense so I've teen are

is not great in defense so I've teen are
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> look<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.200> attack<00:01:07.439> him<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
going to look for attack him as well so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to look for attack him as well so
you<00:01:08.939> won't<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.450> looking<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.320> markets<00:01:11.070> where

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you won't be looking at markets where

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
you won't be looking at markets where
the<00:01:11.369> item<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:11.880> wingers<00:01:12.240> might<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.659> over

the item point wingers might get over

for<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> score<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.439> two<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.400> he's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
for a score or two as well because he's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
for a score or two as well because he's
got<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> boner<00:01:15.180> ability<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> everybody<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
got a boner ability of everybody and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
got a boner ability of everybody and
while<00:01:16.530> rugby<00:01:16.890> knows<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.540> okay<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
while rugby knows it okay and you do you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.399 
while rugby knows it okay and you do you
think<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.380> winning<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
think we're going to see winning this I

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
think we're going to see winning this I
think<00:01:22.409> England<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.189> shade<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.909> think

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
think England will shade it I think

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
think England will shade it I think
it'll<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> close<00:01:24.780> game<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.439> probably<00:01:25.619> not

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it'll be a close game is probably not

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740 
it'll be a close game is probably not
there<00:01:26.189> before<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.850> between<00:01:27.060> three<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.509> five

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
there before them between three and five

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
there before them between three and five
points<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.189> things<00:01:29.640> will

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
points in it but I think things will

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
points in it but I think things will
shade<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.540> because<00:01:30.810> they're<00:01:31.110> coming<00:01:31.350> off

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
shade it just because they're coming off

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
shade it just because they're coming off
the<00:01:32.310> back<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> their<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.150> season<00:01:34.049> an

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the back of their see season an

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
the back of their see season an
Argentine<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:35.880> pick<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> there

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
Argentine just doesn't pick up on there

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
Argentine just doesn't pick up on there
so<00:01:36.960> even<00:01:37.320> though<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.400> bit<00:01:38.670> more

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so even though will be a little bit more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.450 
so even though will be a little bit more
in<00:01:39.000> tune<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.509> another<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> stage

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
in tune with one another at this stage

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
in tune with one another at this stage
okay<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> make<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.960> bet

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
okay and would it make a good a good bet

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
okay and would it make a good a good bet
to<00:01:43.380> bet<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.860> england<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> win<00:01:44.340> or<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.030> there

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to bet on england to win or is there

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.289 
to bet on england to win or is there
other<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.630> other<00:01:45.990> value<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.680> market

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
other as other value at this market

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
other as other value at this market
there's<00:01:48.299> Asif<00:01:48.750> value<00:01:49.079> everywhere<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.740> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
there's Asif value everywhere that are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
there's Asif value everywhere that are
surprisingly<00:01:50.790> short<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> moment<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
surprisingly short on to the moment to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
surprisingly short on to the moment to
win<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.280> looking<00:01:53.490> also<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
win so I would be looking also at the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.080 
win so I would be looking also at the
halftime<00:01:54.659> full<00:01:55.140> tight<00:01:55.380> market<00:01:55.680> way<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.909> can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
halftime full tight market way you can

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850 
halftime full tight market way you can
probably<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> good<00:01:57.960> price<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.560> an

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
probably get a good price on an

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.520 
probably get a good price on an
Argentine<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.790> lead<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.329> halftime<00:02:00.540> anything

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
Argentine to lead at halftime anything

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
Argentine to lead at halftime anything
to<00:02:01.680> come<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> second<00:02:02.610> half<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
to come back in the second half and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300 
to come back in the second half and
again<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.079> might<00:02:04.259> even<00:02:04.439> look<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:05.009> something

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
again I might even look for something

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.609 
again I might even look for something
like<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> first<00:02:06.060> try<00:02:06.360> scorer<00:02:06.750> market<00:02:07.259> but

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
like the first try scorer market but

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.249 
like the first try scorer market but
maybe<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:08.220> too<00:02:08.489> likes<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.149> Christian<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.869> or

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
maybe look too likes of Christian way or

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.020 
maybe look too likes of Christian way or
Johnnie<00:02:11.220> Mae<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.640> he<00:02:11.849> plays

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
Johnnie Mae if he plays

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.820 
Johnnie Mae if he plays
I<00:02:13.060> look<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.870> try<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.170> get<00:02:14.290> some<00:02:14.470> money<00:02:14.590> on

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830

Argentina starting their season England
we<00:02:46.870> can<00:02:47.110> fire<00:02:47.410> having<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:47.890> many<00:02:47.950> players<00:02:48.280> away

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
we can fire having so many players away

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.180 
we can fire having so many players away
with<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.820> Lions<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.620> might<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.950> good

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
with the Lions so that might be a good

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.710 
with the Lions so that might be a good
move<00:02:51.400> because<00:02:51.580> then<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.180> adjust<00:02:52.269> your

the<00:02:54.880> game<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.300> fluctuating<00:02:56.040> there's<00:02:57.040> another

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the game is fluctuating there's another

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.490 
the game is fluctuating there's another
option<00:02:57.730> which<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.330> coming<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.900> form

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
option which is just coming in not form

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.500 
option which is just coming in not form
a<00:02:59.620> couple<00:02:59.890> flow<00:03:00.130> tube<00:03:00.400> upon<00:03:00.700> bit<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.390> that's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
a couple flow tube upon bit but that's

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.780 
a couple flow tube upon bit but that's
just<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> next<00:03:01.959> scoring<00:03:02.530> play<00:03:02.769> market<00:03:03.280> where

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
just the next scoring play market where

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.449 
just the next scoring play market where
again<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.269> can<00:03:04.630> try<00:03:04.959> against<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.130> try<00:03:06.340> and

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
again you can try against in a try and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.090 
again you can try against in a try and
anticipate<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.239> think<00:03:07.450> well<00:03:07.720> if<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.890> seems

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
anticipate and think well if it seems

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.979 
anticipate and think well if it seems
punting<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.550> ball<00:03:09.670> down<00:03:10.030> into<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.630> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
punting the ball down into the of the

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.199 
punting the ball down into the of the
opposition<00:03:11.709> corner<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.370> probably<00:03:12.880> look<00:03:13.060> with

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
opposition corner and probably look with

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.460 
opposition corner and probably look with
the<00:03:13.300> try<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.600> score<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.810> try<00:03:14.080> from<00:03:14.290> that

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the try and score a try from that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.340 
the try and score a try from that
position<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.519> that's<00:03:16.000> another<00:03:16.300> good<00:03:17.140> option

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
position so that's another good option

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.710 
position so that's another good option
odds<00:03:18.130> are<00:03:18.340> never<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.640> great<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.570> can

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
odds are never that great but we can
