backgrounds all different kinds of

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.290 
backgrounds all different kinds of
schools<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.559> different<00:00:51.890> places<00:00:52.159> not<00:00:53.000> only<00:00:53.210> in

the UK but in the world I think probably

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.070 
the UK but in the world I think probably
it's<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.030> kind<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.300> place<00:00:56.510> where<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.780> can<00:00:56.960> be
