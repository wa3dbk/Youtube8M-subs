00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.609
 We know they come back here to make an extremely 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.209
 sandri wedge if it does not rain 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.599
 and this video once again to each block interests we still do not know the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.589
 opponents both in low 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.149
 in the following season but the state centered there paulo 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.919
 and I'll start counting as an option 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.359
 Is this someone interested in meeting the next player? 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.909
 that so 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.909
 in fact a long time ago 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.800
 How did I not study the others? I do not know. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.010
 I understand the girl did not resist with nails and there 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.640
 I think the field factor to its end 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.400
 at the time closed today as the notaries are so fashionable eliane 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.480
 months craquelado solved 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.180
 but it's very good for you 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.570
 so come on 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.880
 he won these two enamel colors I'm going to use 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.480
 the provocation the channel that called police white river 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 and I risked both I took a year 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 Indian preference that is more mosquito 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.140
 m 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 paulo now yes 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.040
 in a few last chat it's physically 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.060
 if you do a job being accepted 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 I'll show the one I'm going to understand 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820
 so that as I was first passing by charming penelope 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.030
 only that there are things that you can pass underneath I advise that if more happens 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.510
 a time layer 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.600
 and I explain why 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 time to spend 5 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.930
 He is a very strange friend to pass enamel. 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 so I do not know if the king will think straight 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 after having a layer that already caught well while coming 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.060
 in the agency 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 I'll pass another layer the same way 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.089
 You're an asshole. 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.479
 after high school I did not mention people leaving others wanted to risk 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.009
 little 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.039
 is now or expect to dry have to expect to dry well because pastor has pointed out 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.110
 so you need to rescue and hit left-handed 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.469
 third place is correct 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.829
 and there now 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.829
 I'll explain to you what should happen 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.729
 and then I'll do it because it's something that has to be very fast again 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:47.299
 she caught fire white glaze go over think pink 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:53.699
 preferably win because it is to seek to pass a stray cover to resort 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.699
 know how white and pink will not cover right 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.349
 What I went through for almost two weeks 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.779
 and very fast right after I pass these layers 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:08.379
 catch a toothpick said jackson capital prevented panamenha neck 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.999
 in 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.429
 in pairs frames 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:13.289
 and in each of the 15 cefapros 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.289
 so in the enamel 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.559
 and then it will have a cracked effect then 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.860
 as I said here 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.860
 traditional time 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.619
 such a request in a wrong 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.449
 Who does not want to be working too hard? 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
 the cure 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.659
 after kleber 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 are 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.289
 in the dispute 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.429
 this Tuesday 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.409
 I will have 1 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.409
 You stay with the same the same player but also 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.909
 even so the local government 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.909
 But that was one day you did the strips. 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.069
 stay with him but under 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.330
 now because it has to be done very fast and the treatment 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.249
 take it yourself be feel 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.710
 reg accident 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.669
 in the first house 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.360
 because that's what happens when you pass the other compensation 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.740
 he this impact 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.689
 It feels like part of the rpc 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.389
 so depending on when you pass the toothpick ended up taking out glaze that give 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.669
 more time 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.150
 by insistence something is very fast so you can be made 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.860
 two colors paulo 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.300
 now if you're into picking up glazes you are not afraid of a very good cover 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.189
 right on the first pass 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.770
 What you can do is to win. 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.080
 It was made corners to pass over this same name pain these bags to 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.669
 cabar bce bank mello here yes renan rocha 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.999
 satellite over these 15 years 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.809
 think about it 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.249
 this effect is 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.319
 quite different not 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.990
 neither 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.580
 he had already warned by the glaze in my hand to overcome me doing the thing is 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.969
 very fast 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.750
 It would not stay many 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.289
 then behind the scenes of richter 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.889
 so I hope you liked it, Chaco never photo is stuck 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.460
 at 4pm 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.470
 CÃ¡ceres is a very quick very simple thing that is not done well 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.559
 different 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:59.519
 it's good to see you until the next lieutenant ethical doubts and managers kiss 

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.199
 as always 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.629
 Raise your hand, whoever disarmed
