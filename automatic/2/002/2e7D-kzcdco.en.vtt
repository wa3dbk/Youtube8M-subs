00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
source of light that source of light

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
source of light that source of light
gets<00:00:28.980> connected<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.939> activator<00:00:30.720> over

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
gets connected to the activator over

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.999 
gets connected to the activator over
there<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> other<00:00:31.380> side

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
there on the other side

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.720 
you gonna put on this little stairway
leading<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.710> tiny<00:00:44.100> middle

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
leading to like this little tiny middle

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.500 
leading to like this little tiny middle
school<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.179> right<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.170> here

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
school thing right over here

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.439 
school thing right over here
jump<00:00:48.140> on<00:00:48.320> top<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.000> grab<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.149> connector

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
jump on top of that grab the connector

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
jump on top of that grab the connector
so<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.839> you<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> box<00:00:52.559> floating<00:00:52.829> without<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so now you have a box floating without a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.860 
so now you have a box floating without a
connector<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.940> means<00:00:54.179> we<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> jump<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
connector which means we can jump on it

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.869 
connector which means we can jump on it
I'm<00:00:57.020> getting<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.440> box<00:00:57.649> come<00:00:58.280> back<00:00:58.520> over<00:00:58.730> here

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
I'm getting the box come back over here

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.750 
I'm getting the box come back over here
put<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.140> connector<00:01:00.620> back<00:01:00.980> where<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:01.309> was<00:01:01.340> when

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
put the connector back where it was when

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.600 
put the connector back where it was when
I<00:01:01.790> first<00:01:02.059> got<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:02.660> connect<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:04.400> light

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
I first got it and connect the light

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.290 
I first got it and connect the light
source<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.330> red<00:01:05.570> activator

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
source to the red activator

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.780 
source to the red activator
this<00:01:07.690> box<00:01:07.900> right<00:01:08.050> here<00:01:08.230> those<00:01:08.710> ended<00:01:09.070> up<00:01:09.220> now

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
this box right here those ended up now

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.540 
this box right here those ended up now
we're<00:01:09.970> going<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.240> make<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.470> we<00:01:11.770> block

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
we're going to make it so that we block

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.850 
we're going to make it so that we block
both<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.270> beams<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.660> light<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.470> box

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
both of the beams of light so that box

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.310 
both of the beams of light so that box
falls<00:01:17.340> across<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.390> before<00:01:19.690> we<00:01:19.810> jump<00:01:20.050> all<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
falls across and before we jump all the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.840 
falls across and before we jump all the
way<00:01:20.470> across<00:01:20.680> we<00:01:20.890> can<00:01:21.010> grab<00:01:21.220> this<00:01:21.370> box

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
way across we can grab this box

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.580 
way across we can grab this box
now<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.450> watch<00:01:22.570> solve<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.020> puzzle<00:01:23.320> we'd<00:01:23.470> be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
now just watch solve the puzzle we'd be

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.260 
now just watch solve the puzzle we'd be
done<00:01:23.740> here<00:01:23.980> we<00:01:24.070> flip<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.400> switch<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.150> be

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
done here we flip that switch and we be

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.960 
done here we flip that switch and we be
done<00:01:25.480> but<00:01:26.230> in<00:01:26.590> order<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.100> see<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.400> Easter<00:01:27.880> egg

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
done but in order to see this Easter egg

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.960 
done but in order to see this Easter egg
we<00:01:28.180> hit<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.450> box<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:29.620> jump<00:01:30.040> on<00:01:30.190> top<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.460> and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
we hit the box to jump on top of and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.540 
we hit the box to jump on top of and
then<00:01:31.660> we're<00:01:31.780> going<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.170> make<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> huge<00:01:33.010> jump

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
then we're going to make a huge jump

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.320 
then we're going to make a huge jump
over<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.120> gate<00:01:34.950> where<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.040> land<00:01:36.970> where<00:01:37.180> the
