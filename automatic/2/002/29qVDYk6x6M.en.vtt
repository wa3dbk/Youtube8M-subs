00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 the coach's teachings leave you 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 honestly there is not one that tells you 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.320
 that left me more deal with each one now 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.110
 the good things 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.410
 and sincerely of all the technicians that 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.010
 have gone from each one I have one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.010
 football reference 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:31.109
 as a player that I like 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 is ronaldo who does not play anymore but I think 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.560
 who was the player who fed me the most 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.110
 I liked more today 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.530
 if you had to get to get one 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.570
 whit what was 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 a guide to the future 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:53.420
 from italy a team from abroad 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.420
 inter dominate a cabal a cabal 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 a friend of soccer 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.570
 friends is quite complicated if 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.990
 I have many colleagues which led me 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 barbarian 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.990
 but I think my childhood friends 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.950
 a hobby 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.600
 a hobby to nap sweet mate or 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 bitter 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.689
 a style of music band and a song 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.640
 I listen to everything no no I'm not a fan of 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.830
 music like that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.150
 I like to listen to the combo of a 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 song for this report 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.540
 you killed me 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.940
 in a moment I listened enough 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 street because I had a friend 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.909
 I was a fanatic but the truth 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.719
 the group 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.719
 a TV show 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.060
 and some sports but this 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.070
 I am with my family at the time my 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 Grandma 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.480
 you might see sweet love 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.060
 develop 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.340
 your place in the world my place in the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 I think the world is my house commission 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.610
 write a place that you would like 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.660
 know 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.650
 and europe I would love to see 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.650
 a meal 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.849
 the great Uruguayan tribute 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.050
 a whim you have 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.260
 do not 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.660
 and I honestly do not have this 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.240
 but I am very calm 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.310
 the nap every day can be one and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.380
 it can be but sometimes it escapes me 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.600
 because many times you have to do 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.360
 things and you have to realize a dream 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.750
 to fulfill and keep growing I think that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.250
 It is important that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.250
 that each person has a vision 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.670
 ah
