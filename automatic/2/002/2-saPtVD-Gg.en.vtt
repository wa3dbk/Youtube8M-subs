team to go farther but here is a pro tip

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.660 
team to go farther but here is a pro tip
if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.210> raise<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.480> higher<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.279> ground

if you raise it higher from like ground

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.939 
if you raise it higher from like ground
level<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.019> will<00:00:31.109> go<00:00:31.140> even<00:00:31.410> farther<00:00:31.710> there

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
level then it will go even farther there

one max take rest owner Peter here
another<00:03:14.680> redstone<00:03:15.390> 2's<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.510> repeaters<00:03:16.780> here

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
another redstone 2's are repeaters here

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.180 
another redstone 2's are repeaters here
and<00:03:18.280> then<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.569> other<00:03:19.600> side<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.530> do

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
and then the other side you can just do

all right stuff nothing special so then
there's<00:03:26.079> your<00:03:27.150> advance<00:03:28.150> team<00:03:28.450> t<00:03:28.660> cannon<00:03:29.079> so

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
there's your advance team t cannon so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.430 
there's your advance team t cannon so
let's<00:03:30.100> say<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.370> wanted<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.850> load<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.870> just

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
let's say I wanted to load it and I just

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.840 
let's say I wanted to load it and I just
enough<00:03:32.829> for<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.040> reason<00:03:33.430> why<00:03:33.549> no<00:03:33.609> yeah<00:03:34.470> boom

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
enough for a reason why no yeah boom

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.259 
enough for a reason why no yeah boom
times<00:03:36.850> at<00:03:37.000> all<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:39.280> light's<00:03:39.519> it

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
times at all for you that light's it

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.490 
times at all for you that light's it
shoots<00:03:40.660> way<00:03:40.900> out<00:03:41.829> there<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.480> Monte<00:03:44.109> you<00:03:44.290> put

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
shoots way out there the Monte you put

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.360 
shoots way out there the Monte you put
on<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.859> back<00:03:45.900> farther<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.290> shot<00:03:47.620> will<00:03:47.829> go<00:03:48.069> and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
on the back farther the shot will go and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.699 
on the back farther the shot will go and
this<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:50.260> made<00:03:50.470> no<00:03:50.500> sense<00:03:50.650> there<00:03:51.160> okay<00:03:52.350> um<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
this just made no sense there okay um so

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.740 
this just made no sense there okay um so
yeah<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.400> martini<00:03:57.849> point<00:03:58.269> on<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.389> back<00:03:58.540> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
yeah the martini point on the back the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.360 
yeah the martini point on the back the
photos<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.230> shot<00:03:59.470> will<00:03:59.620> go<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.099> actually

photos of the shot will go and actually
I<00:04:00.790> will<00:04:01.060> demonstrate<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.720> right<00:04:01.989> now<00:04:04.769> so

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
I will demonstrate that right now so

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.099 
I will demonstrate that right now so
let's<00:04:06.160> say<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.310> loaded<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.819> with<00:04:06.910> one<00:04:07.150> TT<00:04:10.109> want

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
let's say you loaded it with one TT want

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.050 
let's say you loaded it with one TT want
to<00:04:11.200> go<00:04:11.260> far<00:04:11.560> see<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:13.000> yeah<00:04:13.299> now<00:04:14.639> we<00:04:15.639> write<00:04:15.849> back

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
to go far see so yeah now we write back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.779 
to go far see so yeah now we write back
okay<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:17.229> is<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.560> 14<00:04:18.070> t<00:04:18.310> ken<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
okay and this is the 14 t ken in the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.490 
okay and this is the 14 t ken in the
hybrid<00:04:19.180> cannon<00:04:19.599> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
hybrid cannon and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.530 
hybrid cannon and
this<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.160> actually<00:04:21.700> made<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.180> separate<00:04:22.420> video

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
this I actually made in a separate video

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.180 
this I actually made in a separate video
I'm<00:04:22.750> not<00:04:22.870> gonna<00:04:22.960> make<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.200> right<00:04:23.260> now<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.800> not

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
I'm not gonna make it right now it's not

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.900 
I'm not gonna make it right now it's not
it's<00:04:25.060> not<00:04:25.120> like<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.540> fast<00:04:25.810> make<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.950> i'll

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
it's not like it's a fast make so i'll

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.990 
it's not like it's a fast make so i'll
put<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.360> like<00:04:28.690> right<00:04:29.020> here<00:04:29.470> i<00:04:29.980> guess<00:04:30.400> in<00:04:30.730> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
put that like right here i guess in the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.110 
put that like right here i guess in the
top<00:04:31.180> right<00:04:31.390> corner<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:32.280> yes<00:04:33.280> what<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.670> does<00:04:33.850> it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
top right corner and yes what it does it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.440 
top right corner and yes what it does it
makes<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.750> you<00:04:34.810> can<00:04:35.230> go<00:04:35.530> through<00:04:36.450> water

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
makes it so you can go through water

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.600 
makes it so you can go through water
walls<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.380> let<00:04:38.950> me<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:41.080> will<00:04:41.650> not<00:04:41.800> be<00:04:41.830> good

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
walls and let me that will not be good

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.450 
walls and let me that will not be good
if<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.030> make<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.360> TT<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:46.500> let's<00:04:47.500> say<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> base<00:04:48.160> is

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
if I make this TT so let's say a base is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.360 
if I make this TT so let's say a base is
covered<00:04:48.700> with<00:04:48.910> water<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.740> don't<00:04:51.190> get

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
covered with water and I don't get

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.340 
covered with water and I don't get
what's<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.610> on<00:04:51.880> here<00:04:51.940> okay<00:04:52.420> let's<00:04:53.140> say<00:04:53.320> a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
what's going on here okay let's say a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.850 
what's going on here okay let's say a
base<00:04:53.590> is<00:04:53.860> covered<00:04:54.070> with<00:04:54.280> water<00:04:54.580> like<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.000> one

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
base is covered with water like this one

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.150 
base is covered with water like this one
then<00:04:56.860> if<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.430> had<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> hybrid<00:04:58.060> can<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.800> could
