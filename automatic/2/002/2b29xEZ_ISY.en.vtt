 result a school of rigor that does not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.170

 the improve debt related to dha is one 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 first to see this kind of 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.050
 therapy in israel in the early years 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.860
 60 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:37.340
 a real revolution at the time 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.790
 in 1967 after the war there were some 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.400
 wounded 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.930
 some of the students themselves have been 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.110
 wounded during this war is when 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.240
 even been my own riders and after 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.920
 the war he was really very depressed 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.220
 they asked me if he could go back 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.870
 on horseback one day I told them yes 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 it was possible and then what I had 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.459
 to do I was able to show them how 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.820
 ride a horse while having a 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:12.680

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.459
 or mentally able to regain confidence in 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.989

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.540
 year of study 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.860
 when the opportunity arose 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.549
