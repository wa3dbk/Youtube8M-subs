00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.269
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 new friends of the adventure computer 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.250
 you know about gold 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 for all those more than irradiated with alex 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 belts today contrast applications 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 How am I actually behaving? 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 right before we answer 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 We should first turn to this question 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.360
 make aware of which patients 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.480
 get metformin today 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 medications and would someone have me this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.260
 asked a few months ago 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
 I would have spontaneously said that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.110
 diabetics who get in the rule with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.340
 then foil containing drug but then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 I had a seminar participant 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.710
 she did not just say it was diabetics 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.579
 Get vermin today's medications 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 but also the patients on one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.260
 policeman ishutova real syndrome treated 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.700
 become 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.850
 These patients get very much 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.799
 Often with family-containing medications 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 and then I realized that with 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.000
 a pure question of a classical question 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.340
 are they diabetic question marks and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.770
 If yes, take it with you from the content igge 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.700
 Medications fall to us these 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 Patients through the grid 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 now we may not always have 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 so many young women in ct but 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.990
 ct is not the only one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 examination modality where in the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 radiology contrasts and is given 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 in other areas we have quite 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.970
 young patient so we should go 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.759
 always keep in mind when we are 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.759
 Contrast agents do not just give way 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.920
 Patients ask if they have diabetes 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.100
 but especially young patients 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 Women also ask to what extent they are on 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.759
 policeman treated in the oval syndrome 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.409
 and maybe there 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.390
 get fatty medications if 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.220
 found out that the patient 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.680
 with metformin today's drug 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.569
 The question is always how to get 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.599
 then we behave at the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.280
 Contrast agent and depending on where you are 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.519
 this works partly completely 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 differently handled and who themselves 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.890
 because a bit more accurate 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.900
 want to inform 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.410
 I have a very nice job for him 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 found and that is the american 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.730
 college of radiology the link stands 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 below 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 You can do that as a pdf from the internet 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.560
 download 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.840
 and that's a relatively comprehensive one 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.879
 work on recommendations at the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 Contrast gift is, however, on 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.970
 English written on each 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.610
 very highly recommended and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.459
 interesting if you look at the topic 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:57.250
 with the topic contrast agent in the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.900
 radiology is busy when we are 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.069
 Now patients have avoided with 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.930
 containing medications is then 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.739
 a next important question is how is that 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.440
 glomeruli honor filtration advice is the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.560
 glomeruli filtration rate better than 60 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.630
 milliliters per minute will be in these 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.420
 current guidelines recommended by the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.669
 not to sell it first but it 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.769
 just pass it on 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.169
 After 48 hours, however, should the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.209
 control kidney values 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.940
 possibly any 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.380
 deterioration of kidney function 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.609
 to recognize early and then 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.609
 to settle this with formed 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.459
 the other patient group are the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.889
 with energy fr of worse than 60 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.840
 milliliters per minute at which will 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.419
 recommended that metformin at the time 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.349
 the contrast agent gare to settle and 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.190
 at the same time a hydra station 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.169
 so to carry out the patients too 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.540
 vibrate and only after 48 hours 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.780
 the contrast agent and also first 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.609
 after controlling it is to creative 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.069
 that with vom in today's drug again 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.510
 to be set 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.110
 it is important to find out 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.060
 to what extent not 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.380
 a contrast agent indexed 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.380
 nephropathy 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.580
 how it looks now with the hydrogenation 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.290
 We have two patients from there 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.180
 collective once the emergency 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.400
 especially in the hospital you have the yes 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.780
 quite often these are patients 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.940
 which we do not usually so eternally 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.400
 have time to prepare this 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.320
 So let's come to an emergency 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.230
 maybe he is not optimal 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.080
 has and with vermin containing medicines 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.350
 we recommend getting a hydrogenation 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.110
 with a crm solution so 09 percent 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.730
 nacl solution then perform so early 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.430
 as possible with one 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.340
 milliliters per kilogram of body weight 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.820
 nacl per hour so here you earlier 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.350
 start with the government before 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.480
 Examination is better every minute 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.160
 counts and in any case they should 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.390
 twelve hours after the exam or 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.760
 up to twelve hours after the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.950
 Investigation to continue the hydrogenation 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.230
 that means at about 100 kilo 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.090
 Severe patients would be 100 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.710
 milliliters per hour nrc solution 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.960
 mean we have elective 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.130
 Investigations that means patients the 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.190
 we can plan 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.080
 then it may be that we are stationary 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.550
 Patients have the same applies 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.710
 same rule a milliliter per 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.590
 kilogram body weight per hour of a 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.360
 nine percent nacl solution and there 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.430
 but six to twelve hours before 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.690
 and six to twelve hours after 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.520
 contrast lies with the outpatient 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.070
 you should recommend 1 liter 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.660
 liquid over the ten hours before 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.440
 the examination after the examination 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.810
 to drink 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.930
 reason at the same time is also in this 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.330
 work suggested him one more time 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.310
 to carry out hydrogenation 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.040
 but not so long video at 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.110
 the inpatient but who 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.500
 two hours before and four hours behind 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.270
 the investigation 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.530
 I am aware that they are at 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.150
 this is not always the case with outpatients 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.460
 it's just possible, though 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.390
 Recommendations to the one at the one 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.490
 orient yourself 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.950
 please be sure to watch it 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.680
 Feeding when you have a patient 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.060
 are the heart failure 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.039
 then you should be careful 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.039
 or something else 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.410
 summarize I would again say 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.660
 they are always aware of that 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.750
 not only for diabetics get to from 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.900
 him but also with patients 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.590
 We have policeman vario syndrome 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.840
 a gfr the 6 which is greater than 60 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.210
 milliliters per minute can be used with form 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.520
 be continued input and one 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.500
 should be after 48 hours the kreatinin 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.360
 will control 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.639
 at a gfr less than 60 milliliters per 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.130
 minute with him on the day of 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.560
 Examine after 48 hours 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.020
 earliest start again but also 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.080
 only then when the kreatinin gets in 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.750
 order is and very clear recommendation 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.070
 for you she is definitely 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.720
 a good prophylaxis 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.910
 here you will find a few sources 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.310
 which they can read interesting 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.220
 and interesting information about the 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.349
 theme contrast agent 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.210
 However, you will find them in the 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.599
 direct links below the video 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.599
 my homepage 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.320
 So that 's it with the adventure again 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.820
 computer gate missed 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.530
 I hope it has them 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.590
 fallen and it was a few 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.570
 things worth knowing for you 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.580
 if you have some more information 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.530
 wish about me and my seminars 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:52.150
 then just have a look at www 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:57.580
 alex - rebuy.de over or send them 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.290
 an e-mail info at alex media.de if 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.270
 you are logged in to facebook 

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.910
 then I would be very happy if you 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.300
 the adventure computer tomography with the 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.310
 I want to move thumbs upwards 

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.590
 Have a nice time and have fun while 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.680
 steal and hopefully to the next 

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.680
 times
