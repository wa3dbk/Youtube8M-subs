that for Justin Forsett yeah 57 yeah

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.160 
that for Justin Forsett yeah 57 yeah
that's<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.240> that's<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> low<00:00:15.870> end<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that's it I think that's the low end of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
that's it I think that's the low end of
that<00:00:16.289> range<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> say<00:00:17.760> I

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
that range which I was going to say I

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
that range which I was going to say I
will<00:00:18.510> admit<00:00:18.779> digging<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.010> more<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.520> could

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
will admit digging into it more I could

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.160 
will admit digging into it more I could
actually<00:00:20.970> take<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.900> bit

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
actually take this up a little bit

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.439

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
surprised he's not gonna see his tender

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
surprised he's not gonna see his tender
gets<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> game<00:01:32.189> anymore<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.820> wouldn't<00:01:33.210> be

surprised<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.930> thought<00:01:34.110> 67<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.979> knocking

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
surprised but I thought 67 I'm knocking

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
surprised but I thought 67 I'm knocking
off<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> third<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.909> his<00:01:35.970> receptions<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.810> really

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
off the third of his receptions I really

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
off the third of his receptions I really
thought<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> legitimate<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> mean

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
thought that was a legitimate it I mean

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
thought that was a legitimate it I mean
it<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> legitimate<00:01:40.500> number<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it is a legitimate number but when you

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
it is a legitimate number but when you
look<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> coaching<00:01:42.810> philosophy<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
look at the coaching philosophy in the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.380 
look at the coaching philosophy in the
scheme<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> they're<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.640> mean<00:01:44.939> maybe<00:01:45.149> he

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
scheme that they're in I mean maybe he

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
scheme that they're in I mean maybe he
recoups<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.380> Bears<00:01:46.590> defense

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
recoups them because the Bears defense

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
recoups them because the Bears defense
is<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.610> bad<00:01:47.820> they're<00:01:48.030> always<00:01:48.149> passing<00:01:48.659> well

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
is so bad they're always passing well

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.870 
is so bad they're always passing well
dont<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> dont<00:01:49.890> forget<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> rookie

he's very lean he's not basically they

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.580

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
don't have a clear cut number 2 like

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
don't have a clear cut number 2 like
they<00:02:01.680> used<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.070> Marshall<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
they used to have with Marshall and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.370 
they used to have with Marshall and
Geoffrey<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.600> Forte's<00:02:03.960> going

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
Geoffrey so I still think Forte's going

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
Geoffrey so I still think Forte's going
to<00:02:04.469> need<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> involved<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.520> Wilma<00:02:05.820> no<00:02:05.939> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to need to be involved he Wilma no I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
to need to be involved he Wilma no I
think<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.600> bring<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.899> Eddie<00:02:07.079> Royal<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
think they bring in Eddie Royal for a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.229 
think they bring in Eddie Royal for a
lot<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> those<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.399> dump<00:02:08.700> offs<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:09.090> well

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
lot of those little dump offs as well

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.070 
lot of those little dump offs as well
that's<00:02:09.450> good

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that's good

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's good
he's<00:02:10.500> gonna<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:10.830> he<00:02:10.890> always<00:02:11.009> does<00:02:11.250> he's

three<00:02:13.440> weeks<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.800> season<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.160> agree<00:02:14.670> those

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
three weeks of the season I agree those

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
three weeks of the season I agree those
targets<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.570> feel<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:16.710> targets<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.280> are

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
targets I feel are not targets that are

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
targets I feel are not targets that are
coming<00:02:17.700> away<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.090> mercial<00:02:18.540> side<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
coming away from the mercial side so the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.990 
coming away from the mercial side so the
white<00:02:19.350> or<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.650> Wilson<00:02:20.430> side<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> think<00:02:20.760> those

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
white or the Wilson side I think those

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.940 
white or the Wilson side I think those
are<00:02:21.030> Forte<00:02:21.450> targets<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.710> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
are Forte targets I can see that but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550 
are Forte targets I can see that but
that<00:02:23.130> again<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.640> took<00:02:23.700> off<00:02:24.030> 33<00:02:24.420> receptions<00:02:24.990> so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that again I took off 33 receptions so

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.890
