 Percent of the skin and that sounds like her and so little stuff that you know 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.920
 a to make you a small image video 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.410
 Inherit

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 and fortunately I have not got my husband home yet 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 a bit of calm to unite this video 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 and actually there is not much to talk about 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.910
 Decide because I believe that now with Imtech bandages but I thought so 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.540
 in the first just a little bit going on 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.650
 I wanted to say thank you to everyone else because though I am year 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 weeks 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.010
 He was barely in office and I am glad and I welcome you too 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.090
 very warm and around 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.689
 yes there are new videos 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.540
 very soon 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.790
 and finally he has diligently commented on the one of course not in 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.299
 Oblivion 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.170
 Percent was rather bad that I here and there but my comment as 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.360
 Letter to the editor in Hamburg and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 Decision makers actually all the videos gradually 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 now that I have internet again 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 I wanted to tell what I am now Crazy reader 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.720
 I can predict its part myself of its spectacular I've degree 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.100
 louder this fair begins by the move and first of all what I am 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
 grant to read as tired of office 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.039
 Jo I had recently read and sacral that today we read out Amore CIA yet 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.679
 took from Luzia Braun 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.929
 around 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.739
 a book to give me a room for the Italian summer 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 also worked a very nice book, of course, missing sammer 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.339
 but I think so 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.919
 needed ten days 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.029
 and the third time is five days or less 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.329
 August would have started 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.929
 So far, I'm not much further 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.179
 Naumann while I'm just now first on the squares four and six Templar 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.519
 We have not been waiting for what's going to happen now, and that's where life starts 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.670
 it does not have that way 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.979
 has lain 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.889
 and now they are the first time in the youth book 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.199
 I started today 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.639
 Eddie's Ghosts by Barbara Büchner 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.840
 that is in a very small publisher is a move and I have the book 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.409
 even nothing helps a year has been chosen so Biden 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.589
 I have a look where I do not know when he has been on the 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.589
 secondhand-laden flea market 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.699
 our lot of copy comes from below from Abraham I do not remember 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.739
 just plain interested in the language of Chatham County Dr 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.449
 It's about a 15-year-old girl 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.199
 Afford 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.839
 he himself I say to scratchy showpiece daughter is so rejected the parents 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.229
 The Manz are no longer obtainable 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.539
 and then it is so that the parents are killed in a traffic accident 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.689
 that is the one life 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.499
 he sat naturally read in the first chapter 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:45.329
 Antonia did not understand who cock issue have Neumarkt the problem that 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.379
 I've been more frequent lately 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.119
 I catch a book to catch 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.199
 and cakes are as much as much of the star has it because Amazon was so 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.029
 What you can learn about the book on the internet 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.540
 and if she is not quite up 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.540
 that is no longer available »says Encke Zach Dom 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.400
 only this value is book and I could have imagined but 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.839
 if it does not buy now, for example, directly to 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.980
 After all, that's not me, you can do now 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.089
 I like 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.449
 but I will be able to survive it I look what I do with the book market 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.260
 From now on he asked himself questions like you have needed something again and again 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.559
 to get a little faster 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:28.749
 and casually left another book, it's parallels and so is one 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.439
 non-fiction book 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.959
 who but if not wanting more through Cara and 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.939
 Title alike coffee plant more so it looks like the good piece 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.379
 High-tech life of Katja Kullmann with the subtitle 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.680
 why it is so complicated today to have an attitude 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 the pet ownership head of our high-tech contemplation 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 because everything that influences me is dead 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.289
 I just like these popular science books 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.449
 Ardi does not like it that way 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.879
 but this one really seems to be very smart to us 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.330
 simply very well structured relieves e-mails 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.669
 because just 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.020
 employee 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.029
 and around 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.259
 yes for me very very exciting but I think I did not progress so fast 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.740
 because his book is what you are 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.809
 Jaffe take your time 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:25.629
 must and should 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.520
 because it is very honest very much food for thought because both are 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.520
 Like a very exciting book I would like to introduce myself 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.310
 yes that's what I'm reading right now let's see what's going on this month 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.370
 missed achieved 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.370
 Med also a great not to tell 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.770
 Oh, I die 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.860
 I am doing this 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.000
 also because I somehow covered 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.440
 with that at the beginning not the reason I still have two teachers videos 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.939
 had turned 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.939
 but I did not want to upload anything without comment 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.419
 Therefore, this idiom device work like this as well to terminate 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.379
 The guaranteed in the next few days high that it laughs after old Tyrolean 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.379
 Other Seat Leon Brand I do not know yet 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.939
 India Larissa still do not be surprised if the old 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.710
 Background of the last election 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.539
 I stopped you just two weeks ago has turned a certain 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.580
 Burkhalter has uploaded in vain 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.939
 and then i still wanted to ask questions i would have 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.610
 Wanders had Norman 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.509
 Reader Month of July to make video 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.740
 the other two always like to give way too late into the night 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.860
 lapses in suit in these videos 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.729
 but already in mid-August 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.270
 Pauli missed 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.159
 and I know wear because of this Astra TV 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.159
 shall I just postpone this in mid-August? 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.659
 was left so 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.409
 he does not do it because they are ready again 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.719
 is late or such video whose four cubs August together call 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.889
 I can do that too because the land of Mappus sees itself as behaving like that 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.409
 one also writes that «in general we see old and negative in August 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.779
 with both together the ball still and then I do that 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.389
 in the next few days as it is today for Saturday the thirteenth and me today 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.629
 please she will also upload immediately should want tonight up 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.569
 then I can see if I still can 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.569
 yes in the next three days can turn 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.009
 Yakult is all very nice I do something and bulk samples must be there 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.139
 outside he could have - would comment and so on 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.060
 upload cool videos and do not supply with the good book tips 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:46.419
 and i wish a nice evening a bunch of war and the banks and 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.229
 Sunday 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:47.990
 it stays
