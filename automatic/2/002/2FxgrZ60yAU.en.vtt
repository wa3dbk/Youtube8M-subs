00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.590
 The voter is taking a step, I do not even know 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.229
 who is it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.390
 It was kind of obvious, I just did the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.519
 possible and imaginable simply there 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.349
 Bringing a video for you, but knowing 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:15.209
 that the end would be back we finished 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.370
 in with 41 minutes 0 41 342 and now let's 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.170
 see any minutes there which 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.610
 I arrived determined with them around 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.069
 how can they accompany molecule 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.620
 it would be very ugly looks like a itha night 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.660
 towel and producer not who tries towel 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.950
 No, but he married, there's money in his 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 profile of each user 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.670
 we will answer for following 41 181 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.470
 against 41 13 432 we come back here guys 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.989
 So it's there we are here now it's mine 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.299
 play with custom feedback and 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.769
 ugt to manage and will play with the entity 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.200
 So let's go there and let's get 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.000
 that this way 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.280
 Nothing else is for us to take our 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.109
 doubts about cars simply is 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.599
 a race of two kilometers 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.489
 distance to where the cars 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.590
 sixth gear so it 's really cool 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.870
 you can take the initial speed 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 average in the final set of any car 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.269
 so let's go the show can not 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.250
 stop 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.780
 remembering that the ones around a paulo 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.790
 this xf in the first 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.650
 the first time we do not go here no 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.500
 we will get the turbocharger so that the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.900
 car can not take any will 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.060
 that like it or not the school but the date 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.099
 two organs still turbinated will not give 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.079
 nothing is going to be used because many times 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.690
 that guy he does not have the initiative is 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.090
 the initial velocity is very strong and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.599
 Exit souped simply you just 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.459
 picking up is a way out more than 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.190
 car did not have it has average speed 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.560
 and the larger end that the other speaks ends 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.750
 giving boston on time you're done 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.090
 winning a race that you may not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.410

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.650
 more than to show you if you 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.349
