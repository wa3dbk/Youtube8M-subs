 HTC as the two flagship devices

 we have a very nice one here 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.870
 smartphone in unibody design who is me 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.850
 a polycarbonate housing 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.800
 that feels very very valuable is on 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.520
 the back rubberized so we know 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.690
 that also from the htc evo ix had moderate 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.810
 that's about the same 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.520
 level like the htc evo ix a small one 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.190
 except that there is no nvidia tegra 3 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.770
 quad core processor but a qualcomm 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.440
 snapdragon s4 dual core processor for 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.430
 is used , namely the msm 82 60 a 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.450
 with 11 5 gigahertz per core and the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.210
 adreno 225 gpu on the back 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.790
 me an eight megapixel here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.119
 main camera that there is a f20 camera with 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.030
 28 millimeter wide-angle lens and 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.030
 bsi sensor that is backwards 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.270
 Illuminated we have here as well 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.619
 a htc own picture chip for 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.090
 better pictures in bad 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.460
 light conditions 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.479
 the same camera we already from the htc 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.670
 evo ix know and next to a led lightning 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.000
 the camera is very nice in the housing 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.090
 hiding does not look at all we 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.729
 also have the 3.5 mm up here 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 audio connection the second microphone to 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.900
 active noise connection and the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.000
 on and off button on the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.940
 back still the htc logo 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.670
 beats audio logo and the media 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.250
 spokesman in the new htc be nice 1 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.900
 Drilled fits very well with the design 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 on the bottom 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.390
 the micro-usb connection with the main 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.939
 microphones on the right side we 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 first the micro sim card slot 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:34.060
 including the volume rocker and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.239
 underneath we have the camera key on 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.849
 the left side we have nothing and 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.879
 on the front a 4.3 welcomes us 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.489
 inch big super lcd 2 display which 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.970
 We are protected by gorilla glas two 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.040
 have here is a resolution of 720 x 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.109
 1280 pixels that is the resolution of the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.220
 laminates as we do that from the 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.909
 hc hans know 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.480
 I'll show you that once I have one 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.389
 very nice view of the colors 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.280
 are presented very well 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:09.609
 a very nice display is on the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.620
 level of ips display on the 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.010
 front , I have a very good one here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.069
 2 megapixel front camera with a f20 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.129
 iris as take the pinna htc logo 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.689
 and a few sensors under the display 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.079
 we have the windows typical buttons 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.840
 once back windows and I'm looking for 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.879
 I am also able to see clearly 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.639
 how the display is built or the 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.560
 glass just here a slight rounding off 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.359
 and that goes into the housing design 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.760
 while here a very nice and 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.849
 Housing design which is very good too 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.190
 windows phone 8 fits htc has this 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.810
 hardware design to the software design 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.109
 adapted from windows phone 8 so 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.030
 software and hardware in one go 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.470
 how come I still have 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
 under the hood a gigabyte 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.680
 Memory 16 GB internal memory 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.609
 1800 mAh mah battery 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.099
 battery can not be replaced unfortunately 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.870
 and the internal memory can be 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.440
 not be extended 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.479
 just like we at htc smartphones 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.620
 we know the device again 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:18.370
 a life here windows phone 8 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.349
 if I lock it in here we see that 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.750
 new homescreen from windows phone on 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.340
 how can the tiles be sized here 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.050
 change if here to a tile 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.319
 I can hold on for a long time 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.270
 make the class very small or on 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:35.300
 the full width or back to the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.280
 we provide the medium size adjustment 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.080
 many more options homescreen too 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.020
 shape and what I personally very 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.889
 Well, that's what this apprenticeship is 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.169
 I'm here on the right 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.849
 disappeared and this case too 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.560
 no more that means we can do that 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:55.879
 exploit the entire potential of the display 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:00.949
 the windows phone 8x with htcs 132 35 mm 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:03.469
 high 66 2 mm wide and 10 12 mm thick and 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.569
 weighs 130 grams, of course, comes with 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.810
 such features as nfc bluetooth and 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.830
 wifi therefore comes in early november in the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.449
 Trade with a non-binding 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.129
 price of 549 euros I think 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.900
 one that the street price relative 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.699
 falling fast will leave me here 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.330
 to get a very good price 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.190
 and I think that too 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.740
 will be very successful that was that 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.539
 windows phone 8x at htc then fell for 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.539
 watch and see you next video
