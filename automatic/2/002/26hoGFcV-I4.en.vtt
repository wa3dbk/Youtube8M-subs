00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.620
 Today we look at classic 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.890
 the German cruise market building year 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 1987 the astor with room for 600 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.059
 We see passengers outside here 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.429
 even the outside area of the so-called 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 astor suite and this song is so far 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.660
 remarkable that is namely with 59 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.150
 square meters one of the largest suites 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 ever on a german ship 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 not malaria or tui cruises have eg 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 So great offer so there is only 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 this one booked accordingly well 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.359
 is that then always and we 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 see here quite classically come along 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.700
 two sinks, the shower, the toilet 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 I have now saves us time that is the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 separate living area and I have too 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.610
 another desk on which I then 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 For example, I could work 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 let's see how do you like that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.930
 ship actually so please write one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 the comments as you find it so 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 is the pool deck or over 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 there are two decks 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 Outside area and he is in the back part 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.420
 of the ship in the eighth area and there 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 We also see the pool which was here 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 just covered 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.070
 there can be a fan in the evening 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 Play on it very practical and you 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 Of course, you can also sit on the sides 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.799
 starboard and port on the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.060
 promenade deck that's such an area 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.040
 I really like to like it because of me 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.960
 not so the sun fan is relatively far 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.820
 down the so-called wellness oasis so 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.770
 what is not there only with aida no 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.549
 the term is obviously not protected 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.960
 yes there is an indoor pool and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.119
 relatively new that's what you have later 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 these are the lie are the are 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 warmed so if you back pain 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 or so apparently ideal and that is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.049
 Treatment Cabin if I add it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.729
 Unfortunately, of course, everything would be nice 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.680
 without a window because it is so deep 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 Reception area interesting for everyone 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 Cabin there is a safe if you so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 precious jewelry has exactly 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.430
 this is not the right one 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.350
 waldorf school that is the forest village 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 restaurant and that is actually one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.960
 Serving restaurant but you have too 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.399
 a small buffet area for 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.570
 for example, if you want to get salad 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 and this is the buffet restaurant 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.420
 namely the overseas club itself 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
 again located high up and as 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.310
 Last one we have the one here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.540
 sports area so relatively simple but 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.939
 Please consider the ship is 25 years old 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.890
 old so there it was not so 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.240
 really such a sports area so yes 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 write it in the comments as has 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.899
 you like that who is such a classic 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.849
 Cruise ship also something for you 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.560
 otherwise look again on the channel 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.250
 over there I just linked times and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 subscribe to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 of course and then listen and see us 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.480
 again next time until then 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.480
 makes a good walk
