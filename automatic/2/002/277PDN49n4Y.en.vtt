the<00:00:11.700> oblique<00:00:12.090> Extreme<00:00:12.660> Pro<00:00:12.870> case<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the oblique Extreme Pro case with the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.400 
the oblique Extreme Pro case with the
galaxy<00:00:14.130> s5<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> rugged<00:00:15.780> style<00:00:16.139> case

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
galaxy s5 this is a rugged style case

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.750 
galaxy s5 this is a rugged style case
let's<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.859> ahead<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> look<00:00:17.369> at<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
let's go ahead and take a look at it

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.640 
let's go ahead and take a look at it
it's<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.090> pretty<00:00:18.330> standard<00:00:18.660> packaging<00:00:19.170> got

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it's got pretty standard packaging got

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.929 
it's got pretty standard packaging got
some<00:00:19.770> information<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> back<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
some information on the back to take a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.359 
some information on the back to take a
look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> dual<00:00:22.529> layer<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
look at but this is a dual layer kind of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.300 
look at but this is a dual layer kind of
style<00:00:23.609> case<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.600> TPU<00:00:25.310> inside

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
style case so you got like a TPU inside

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.580 
style case so you got like a TPU inside
then<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> hard<00:00:26.910> shell<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> outside<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:28.380> look

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
then a hard shell on the outside we look

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
then a hard shell on the outside we look
on<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> inside<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> actually<00:00:29.849> does

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
on the inside what this actually does

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.990 
on the inside what this actually does
this<00:00:30.390> kind<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> texture<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.070> allows<00:00:32.640> some

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this kind of texture here it allows some

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.900 
this kind of texture here it allows some
impact<00:00:33.450> absorption<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.160> by

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
impact absorption so that's actually by

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850 
impact absorption so that's actually by
design<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.559> cool-looking

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
design it's not just this cool-looking

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
design it's not just this cool-looking
little<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:38.930> provides<00:00:39.930> some

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
little thing it actually provides some

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.630 
little thing it actually provides some
good<00:00:40.320> protection<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.430> let's<00:00:41.579> go

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
good protection that way so let's go

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600 
good protection that way so let's go
ahead<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.270> installed<00:00:43.610> just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
ahead and get this on installed just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
ahead and get this on installed just
kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.270> press<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.079> goes<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.559> really

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
kind of press it on in it goes in really

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
kind of press it on in it goes in really
easy<00:00:47.039> mind<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.149> actually<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
easy mind that I actually have a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
easy mind that I actually have a
tempered<00:00:49.260> glass<00:00:49.289> screen<00:00:49.559> protector<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
tempered glass screen protector on this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
tempered glass screen protector on this
and<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.149> not<00:00:51.210> interfering<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.289> all

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and it's not interfering with it at all

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.290 
and it's not interfering with it at all
so<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.739> compatible<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.340> tempered<00:00:54.270> glass

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so it's compatible with tempered glass

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
so it's compatible with tempered glass
screen<00:00:54.480> protectors<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.649> specific<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.760> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
screen protectors to be specific this is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.439 
screen protectors to be specific this is
the<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.410> glass<00:00:58.710> nano<00:00:59.160> t<00:00:59.489> tempered

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the just like glass nano t tempered

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
the just like glass nano t tempered
glass<00:01:00.480> screen<00:01:00.660> protector<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.039> I'll<00:01:02.160> leave<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
glass screen protector and I'll leave a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.650 
glass screen protector and I'll leave a

around<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> case<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.790> notice<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
around the case you notice that you do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
around the case you notice that you do
have<00:01:06.600> button<00:01:06.900> covers<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
have button covers and if you know my

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
have button covers and if you know my
channel<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> stickler<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.930> button<00:01:10.290> cover

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
channel I'm a stickler on button cover

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
channel I'm a stickler on button cover
so<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> works<00:01:12.380> works<00:01:13.380> really

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so that see how this works works really

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.730 
so that see how this works works really
easy<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.430> passes<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:14.970> test<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.740> you're

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
easy so that passes my test if you're

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
easy so that passes my test if you're
new<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> my<00:01:17.250> channel<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.970> picky<00:01:18.180> about

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
new to my channel I'm really picky about

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810 
new to my channel I'm really picky about
button<00:01:19.020> covers<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.040> they're<00:01:20.549> hard<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
button covers because if they're hard to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
button covers because if they're hard to
press<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.420> won't<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> case<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.619> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
press I won't use the case at all so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
press I won't use the case at all so
it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> big<00:01:23.700> deal<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> me<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.600> left<00:01:24.810> hand

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's a big deal to me on the left hand

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.179 
it's a big deal to me on the left hand
side<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> device<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
side of the device you do have the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.020 
side of the device you do have the
volume<00:01:26.610> rocker<00:01:26.640> controls<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.790> works

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
volume rocker controls and this works

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
volume rocker controls and this works
just<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.390> good<00:01:30.479> too<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.380> good<00:01:31.530> job<00:01:31.740> with

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
just as good too so really good job with

little<00:01:44.700> gap<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.560> able<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:46.860> your

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 

I<00:01:53.220> don't<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.760> I'll<00:01:53.970> ever<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.390> used<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I don't think I'll ever get used to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.219 
I don't think I'll ever get used to
having<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.080> USB<00:01:55.710> cover<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
having this USB cover here but yeah you

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.030 
having this USB cover here but yeah you
can<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.950> just<00:02:00.409> it's<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
can get to it just it's like I get the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590 
can get to it just it's like I get the
idea<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.610> supposed<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> help<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
idea that it's supposed to help with the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.570 
idea that it's supposed to help with the
waterproof<00:02:04.080> aspect<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.280> still<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
waterproof aspect of it but it's still a

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.900 
waterproof aspect of it but it's still a
pain<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> butt<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.580> still<00:02:08.729> get

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
pain in the butt but you can still get

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
pain in the butt but you can still get
to<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.289> good<00:02:10.440> sign<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.160> like

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to it so that's a good sign and I like

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880 
to it so that's a good sign and I like
how<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.730> lowered<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> edge<00:02:12.810> here<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.380> would

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
how they lowered the edge here I would

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.530 
how they lowered the edge here I would
assume<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.270> cover

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
assume that if this is not have a cover

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.990 
assume that if this is not have a cover
on<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.650> would<00:02:16.800> match<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.310> level

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
on it that it would match the level

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
on it that it would match the level
right<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.660> well<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.319> back<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
right here as well on the back we have a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
right here as well on the back we have a
full<00:02:20.400> cut<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.060> camera<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.569> also

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
texture to it it's going to be

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.660 
texture to it it's going to be
pocketable<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.220> go<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.610> out

your pocket with ease that's another big
factor<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.370> me<00:02:56.549> for<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> case<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.480> got<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> be

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
factor for me for a case it's got to be

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.050 
factor for me for a case it's got to be
pocketable<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> sort<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.340> X<00:02:59.610> design

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
pocketable I like the sort of X design

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.610 
pocketable I like the sort of X design
on<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.329> back<00:03:00.360> kind<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.900> gives<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.170> nice<00:03:01.260> rugged

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
on the back kind of gives a nice rugged

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.039 
on the back kind of gives a nice rugged
feel<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.459> look<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.390> overall<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.870> think

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
feel to it and look so overall I think

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.870 
feel to it and look so overall I think
this<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.470> good<00:03:04.620> case<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.010> check<00:03:05.400> out<00:03:05.610> it's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
this is a good case to check out it's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.250 
this is a good case to check out it's
going<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:06.239> durable<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:07.079> going<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
going to be very durable it's going to

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.620 
going to be very durable it's going to
be<00:03:07.320> protective<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.549> looks<00:03:08.820> good<00:03:09.120> i<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.510> has

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
be protective it looks good i think has

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.930 
be protective it looks good i think has
a<00:03:09.660> nice<00:03:09.900> style<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.579> dual<00:03:11.760> layer

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
a nice style to it I like the dual layer
