00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
top of the roof and what is considered

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
there's a room right here and you get

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.040 
there's a room right here and you get
here<00:02:17.510> by<00:02:18.140> basically<00:02:19.030> heading<00:02:20.050> straight

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
here by basically heading straight

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.360 
here by basically heading straight
toward<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.770> path

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
toward that path

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.160 
toward that path
after<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.030> Sokoloff<00:02:23.600> painting<00:02:23.990> it's

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
after you get the Sokoloff painting it's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.710 
after you get the Sokoloff painting it's
like<00:02:24.320> another<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.010> guess<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.000> pathway<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
like another I guess a pathway that you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.680 
like another I guess a pathway that you
could<00:02:26.930> head<00:02:27.200> out<00:02:27.410> from<00:02:28.360> after<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
could head out from after you get the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.610 
could head out from after you get the
Sokoloff<00:02:30.110> painting<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:33.380> could<00:02:33.530> have

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
Sokoloff painting so you could have

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.800 
Sokoloff painting so you could have
gotten<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.100> like<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:35.240> case<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.600> didn't

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
gotten here like that in case you didn't

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.960 
gotten here like that in case you didn't
know<00:02:35.840> how<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.260> here<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.160> that's<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
know how to get here so that's that so

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.670 
know how to get here so that's that so
that's<00:02:38.120> four<00:02:38.420> out<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.600> four<00:02:38.870> rooms<00:02:39.140> for<00:02:39.530> this

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
that's four out of four rooms for this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.110 
that's four out of four rooms for this
mission<00:02:39.890> mission<00:02:40.250> six<00:02:40.580> returned<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.030> the
