specifically dried flowers I even had
these<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:45.030> over<00:00:45.059> his<00:00:45.420> house<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.989> hanging

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
these all over his house like hanging

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.130 
these all over his house like hanging
out<00:00:46.469> upside<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.640> bundles<00:00:48.210> he<00:00:48.750> has<00:00:48.930> some

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
hanging not individually and I think

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910 
hanging not individually and I think
it's<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> very

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's so so so pretty these are the very

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
I decided to hang upside down and I let
them<00:01:00.149> die<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:01.980> stay<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.520> I
