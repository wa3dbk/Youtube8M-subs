00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.890
 So that's what the bird looks like when he does 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.769
 finished and we catch today is the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.969
 actually easy to find if you have it 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.859
 So one can understand 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.279
 square paper 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.470
 this is so fallen here once and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.470
 now have to stop 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:01:20.179
 turn around and then here again 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:20.179
 whole now fold up the whole 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.670
 and on the other side too 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:48.720
 the whole thing looks like this now 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 tip down and fold again 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.020
 then of course the lower one has to open 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.910
 his 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.910
 pull this point upwards 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:50.480
 again the top coat side too 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 here are two open tips 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:04.880
 stand up and the other one is 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:16.330
 this and the open there and then on the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:21.250
 other side as well here now 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.250
 this should open here 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:43.519
 there are the feet fold up also 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.519
 fold 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:04:13.530
 if it is like this here after 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:23.930
 rear wings here now we want the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:27.919
 head once and then bend and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.919
 back up 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.600
 and that is there and now that actually 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:50.930
 is missing at the feet but still that 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:50.930
 not here 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.330
 you should too 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.360
 but she finished the birdsong and 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.360
 looks like
