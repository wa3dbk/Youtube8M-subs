then I got about 900 feet to come down

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050 
then I got about 900 feet to come down
this<00:02:09.209> road<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.430> finish<00:02:11.430> off

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
you can hear my new digital servo just

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.380 
you can hear my new digital servo just
put<00:03:02.700> our<00:03:02.790> 79<00:03:03.330> 55<00:03:04.430> titanium<00:03:05.430> agir<00:03:05.760> servo<00:03:06.239> in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
put our 79 55 titanium agir servo in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.699 
put our 79 55 titanium agir servo in
here<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.870> always<00:03:07.049> trying<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> keep

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
here and it's always trying to keep

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.789 
here and it's always trying to keep
Center<00:03:08.129> as<00:03:08.250> best<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.640> possible<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:09.620> hope<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
Center as best as possible I hope and

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.890 
Center as best as possible I hope and
the<00:03:10.860> GPS<00:03:11.310> stays<00:03:11.610> on<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.120> ever<00:03:12.299> had<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.629> on<00:03:12.720> this

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the GPS stays on and ever had it on this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
the GPS stays on and ever had it on this
spot<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> usually<00:03:13.590> mount<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.980> tape<00:03:14.159> it<00:03:14.310> down<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
spot I usually mount to tape it down to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.630 
spot I usually mount to tape it down to
the<00:03:14.730> top<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.470> rear<00:03:16.680> high<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.250> swing

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the top of the the rear high for swing

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180 
the top of the the rear high for swing
but<00:03:18.049> I'm<00:03:19.049> gonna<00:03:19.230> hope<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.590> stays<00:03:19.799> there<00:03:20.099> I'm

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but I'm gonna hope it stays there I'm

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.890 
but I'm gonna hope it stays there I'm
gonna<00:03:20.310> hope<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.579> don't<00:03:20.640> crash<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
gonna hope I don't crash it and then a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.440 
gonna hope I don't crash it and then a
hope<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.170> wheel<00:03:22.379> doesn't<00:03:22.829> fly<00:03:23.069> off<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.790> probably

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
hope a wheel doesn't fly off I probably

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.630 
hope a wheel doesn't fly off I probably
should<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.720> checked<00:03:24.810> my<00:03:25.099> wheel<00:03:26.099> nuts<00:03:26.400> first

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
should have checked my wheel nuts first

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.640 
should have checked my wheel nuts first
but<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> got<00:03:27.000> them<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.329> there<00:03:27.480> fairly<00:03:27.900> tight

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.009 

I'll<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.859> if<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.190> position<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.700> camera<00:03:33.019> to

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
I'll see if I can position the camera to

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.140 
I'll see if I can position the camera to
the<00:03:34.140> best<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.500> my<00:03:34.650> ability<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
the best of my ability see the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.179 
the best of my ability see the
I<00:03:43.150> see<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.329> servo<00:03:44.659> will<00:03:45.049> action<00:03:45.409> another<00:03:45.590> 79

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
I see the servo will action another 79

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.649 
I see the servo will action another 79
55<00:03:47.379> super<00:03:48.379> high<00:03:48.500> torque<00:03:48.829> 333<00:03:49.819> ounces<00:03:50.329> which<00:03:50.510> i

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
55 super high torque 333 ounces which i

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.839 
55 super high torque 333 ounces which i
think<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:51.140> around<00:03:51.470> 20<00:03:52.099> foot<00:03:52.340> pounds<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.790> torque

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
think is around 20 foot pounds of torque

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.089 
think is around 20 foot pounds of torque
so<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:56.510> vehicle<00:03:56.959> coming<00:03:57.170> now<00:03:57.439> I'm<00:03:57.769> gonna<00:03:57.890> see

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
so the vehicle coming now I'm gonna see

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.949 
so the vehicle coming now I'm gonna see
if<00:03:58.189> I<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:58.430> set<00:03:58.909> up<00:03:58.939> the<00:03:59.150> camera<00:03:59.569> I'll<00:03:59.659> put<00:03:59.840> this

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
if I can set up the camera I'll put this

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.330 
if I can set up the camera I'll put this
down<00:04:03.099> let's<00:04:04.099> see<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:05.750> we<00:04:05.870> can<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.260> some<00:04:07.189> good

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
down let's see if we can get some good

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.720 
down let's see if we can get some good
footage<00:04:08.319> seems<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.470> be<00:04:09.590> alright<00:04:09.920> right<00:04:10.189> there
