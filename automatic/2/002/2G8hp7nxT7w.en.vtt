on<00:03:22.320> random<00:03:22.799> floors<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.489> run<00:03:23.700> all<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> way<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
on random floors you run all the way to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.699 
on random floors you run all the way to
the<00:03:24.269> right<00:03:24.480> again<00:03:24.660> only<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.440> faced<00:03:25.680> with

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the right again only to be faced with

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.000 
the right again only to be faced with
the<00:03:26.010> same<00:03:26.280> problem<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.450> dead<00:03:27.750> end<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.709> what

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
the same problem it's a dead end so what

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.039 
the same problem it's a dead end so what
do<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.670> go<00:03:29.820> left<00:03:30.090> again<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:30.959> you

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
do you do you go left again and when you

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.229 
do you do you go left again and when you
get<00:03:31.140> back<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.680> elevator<00:03:31.950> only<00:03:32.670> then<00:03:32.940> can

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
get back to the elevator only then can

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.539 
get back to the elevator only then can
you<00:03:33.299> advance<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.140> next<00:03:34.290> random<00:03:34.709> floor<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
you advance to the next random floor it

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.060 
you advance to the next random floor it
doesn't<00:03:35.970> make<00:03:36.150> any<00:03:36.480> logical<00:03:36.930> fucking<00:03:37.709> sense

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
doesn't make any logical fucking sense

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.310 
doesn't make any logical fucking sense
so<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.299> going<00:03:39.510> around<00:03:39.630> dodging

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.440 
so you're just going around dodging
everything<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.130> sometimes<00:03:41.549> it's<00:03:41.760> impossible

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
everything and sometimes it's impossible

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.300 
everything and sometimes it's impossible
to<00:03:42.540> jump<00:03:42.810> over<00:03:43.110> people<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.739> really<00:03:44.130> need<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310

I<00:04:03.319> didn't<00:04:04.129> even<00:04:04.190> know<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.640> could<00:04:04.670> be<00:04:04.790> used<00:04:05.000> as

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
I didn't even know it could be used as

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.089 
I didn't even know it could be used as
an<00:04:05.300> attack<00:04:05.629> until<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.230> got<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.800> chef
