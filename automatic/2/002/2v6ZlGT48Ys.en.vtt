00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
obsidian blocks which this is actually a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.589 
obsidian blocks which this is actually a
super-compressed<00:02:46.769> obsidian<00:02:47.609> block<00:02:47.879> i<00:02:48.420> don't

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
super-compressed obsidian block i don't

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.050 
super-compressed obsidian block i don't
i'm<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:49.260> sure<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.859> it's<00:02:50.519> something<00:02:50.849> like

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
i'm pretty sure that it's something like

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.599 
i'm pretty sure that it's something like
um<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.870> obsidian<00:02:52.470> regular<00:02:52.980> obsidian<00:02:53.370> blocks

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
um the obsidian regular obsidian blocks

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.300 
um the obsidian regular obsidian blocks
are<00:02:54.049> like<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.590> kind<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.129> um

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
are like this is kind of like what um

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
are like this is kind of like what um
you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:56.879> actually<00:02:57.390> hit<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.840> I'm<00:02:58.349> sitting

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you can actually hit it like I'm sitting

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.619 
you can actually hit it like I'm sitting
if<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.129> put<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.609> like<00:02:59.640> it'll<00:03:00.120> take<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> while

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
if I put it down like it'll take a while

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.509 
if I put it down like it'll take a while
for<00:03:00.690> me<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> mine<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:04.069> it'll<00:03:05.069> take<00:03:05.220> probably

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
for me to mine it it'll take probably

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.949 
for me to mine it it'll take probably
longer<00:03:05.700> for<00:03:06.000> me<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.209> mine<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.569> then<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
longer for me to mine it then the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.970 
longer for me to mine it then the
regular<00:03:07.349> obsidian<00:03:07.879> so<00:03:08.879> um<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.690> have

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
regular obsidian so um you can have

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.860 
regular obsidian so um you can have
obsidian<00:03:10.980> blocks<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.459> compress<00:03:12.359> obsidian

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
obsidian blocks of compress obsidian

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
obsidian blocks of compress obsidian
blocks<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.349> super<00:03:14.129> compressed<00:03:14.370> obsidian

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
blocks and super compressed obsidian

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.240 
blocks and super compressed obsidian
blocks<00:03:15.290> next<00:03:16.290> thing<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.560> brings<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> coal

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
blocks next thing it brings as a coal

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.740 
blocks next thing it brings as a coal
block<00:03:17.549> which<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.060> pretty<00:03:18.209> cool<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:20.599> don't<00:03:21.599> know

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
block which is pretty cool I don't know

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.229 
block which is pretty cool I don't know
what<00:03:22.109> this<00:03:22.319> uses<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.220> I'm<00:03:23.370> sure<00:03:23.549> someone

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
what this uses for but I'm sure someone

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.180 
what this uses for but I'm sure someone
can<00:03:24.299> figure<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.750> out<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.019> something<00:03:25.230> there's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
can figure it out for something there's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.039 
can figure it out for something there's
this<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.579> compressed<00:03:27.000> coal<00:03:27.209> block<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.720> a

this a compressed coal block and a
super-compressed<00:03:29.010> coal<00:03:29.400> block<00:03:29.660> here's<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
super-compressed coal block here's a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.780 
super-compressed coal block here's a
stone<00:03:31.169> workbench<00:03:31.769> which<00:03:31.889> is<00:03:32.160> very<00:03:32.669> cool<00:03:33.030> I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
guessing if like I had to guess it was

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.170 
guessing if like I had to guess it was
um<00:04:45.120> reinforced<00:04:46.050> like<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:47.490> was<00:04:47.669> kind<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.970> like

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
um reinforced like it was kind of like

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.480 
um reinforced like it was kind of like
the<00:04:48.389> UM<00:04:48.540> what<00:04:49.440> am<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.650> doing<00:04:49.680> here<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.190> don't<00:04:50.430> even

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
the UM what am I doing here I don't even

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.810 
the UM what am I doing here I don't even
know<00:04:50.669> what<00:04:51.830> yeah<00:04:52.830> whatever<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.460> don't<00:04:53.760> know

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
know what yeah whatever I don't know

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.300 
know what yeah whatever I don't know
what<00:04:53.940> this<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.210> for<00:04:54.360> but<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:56.130> could<00:04:56.280> probably

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
what this is for but you could probably

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.520 
what this is for but you could probably
figure<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.790> out<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.450> I'm<00:04:57.900> pretty<00:04:58.020> sure<00:04:58.139> that's

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
figure it out so I'm pretty sure that's

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.969 
figure it out so I'm pretty sure that's
a<00:04:58.980> lot<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.270> mod<00:05:00.479> oh<00:05:00.720> here<00:05:00.990> we<00:05:01.020> go<00:05:01.200> okay<00:05:01.919> so

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
a lot of this mod oh here we go okay so

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.310 
a lot of this mod oh here we go okay so
this<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.930> obsidian<00:05:03.930> in<00:05:04.350> God's<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:09.320> it's

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
this is obsidian in God's so it's

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.610 
this is obsidian in God's so it's
basically<00:05:10.860> exactly<00:05:11.490> like<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.720> original<00:05:13.470> in

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
basically exactly like the original in

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.170 
basically exactly like the original in
God's<00:05:14.120> like<00:05:15.120> if<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:15.889> get<00:05:16.889> a<00:05:18.710> iron<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.100> got<00:05:20.280> then

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
God's like if I get a iron and got then

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.240 
God's like if I get a iron and got then
if<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.810> look<00:05:21.990> at<00:05:22.169> them<00:05:22.380> next<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.070> each<00:05:23.100> other

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
if you look at them next to each other

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.070 
if you look at them next to each other
it's<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.790> same<00:05:23.970> exact<00:05:24.330> thing<00:05:25.669> so<00:05:26.720> Anna<00:05:27.720> the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
it's the same exact thing so Anna the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.900 
it's the same exact thing so Anna the
last<00:05:28.260> thing<00:05:28.440> about<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.770> mod<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.520> glowing

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
last thing about this mod is the glowing

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.580 
last thing about this mod is the glowing
obsidian<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:30.660> got<00:05:30.870> which<00:05:31.080> is<00:05:31.260> basically

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
obsidian and got which is basically

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.529 
obsidian and got which is basically
those<00:05:31.830> things<00:05:32.100> maybe<00:05:32.760> that's<00:05:33.060> what<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.390> use

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
those things maybe that's what you use

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.670 
those things maybe that's what you use
to<00:05:33.570> make<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.500> chest<00:05:35.460> and<00:05:35.700> everything<00:05:36.680> pretty

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
to make the chest and everything pretty

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.440 
to make the chest and everything pretty
sure<00:05:37.890> it's<00:05:38.070> something<00:05:38.220> like<00:05:38.340> yeah<00:05:39.000> see<00:05:39.300> there

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
sure it's something like yeah see there

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.120 
sure it's something like yeah see there
you<00:05:39.539> go<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:39.870> there's<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.140> glowing<00:05:40.710> obsidian

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
you go so there's a glowing obsidian

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.650 
you go so there's a glowing obsidian
hammer<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.960> um<00:05:42.960> if<00:05:43.650> I'm<00:05:43.950> guessing<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.789> sword

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
hammer and um if I'm guessing a sword

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.420 
hammer and um if I'm guessing a sword
will<00:05:45.900> be<00:05:46.020> like<00:05:46.229> a<00:05:46.260> normal<00:05:46.620> sword<00:05:46.860> yeah<00:05:47.220> so

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
will be like a normal sword yeah so

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.279 
will be like a normal sword yeah so
there's<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:47.850> so<00:05:48.539> um<00:05:48.720> it's<00:05:48.900> basically

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
there's that so um it's basically

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.920 
there's that so um it's basically
exactly<00:05:49.860> like<00:05:50.340> what<00:05:50.610> you're<00:05:50.760> used<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:51.210> except

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
exactly like what you're used to except

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.450 
exactly like what you're used to except
instead<00:05:52.080> of<00:05:52.260> would<00:05:52.620> you<00:05:52.890> use<00:05:53.100> these<00:05:53.250> things

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
instead of would you use these things

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.670 
instead of would you use these things
called<00:05:53.640> obsidian<00:05:54.000> rods<00:05:54.479> and<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.350> on<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
called obsidian rods and it's on the

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.820 
called obsidian rods and it's on the
same<00:05:55.860> thing<00:05:56.190> for<00:05:56.669> like<00:05:57.479> these<00:05:57.720> stone<00:05:58.020> tools<00:05:58.380> or

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
same thing for like these stone tools or

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.710 
same thing for like these stone tools or
so<00:05:59.669> if<00:06:00.090> i<00:06:00.210> wanted<00:06:00.419> to<00:06:00.510> make<00:06:00.660> an<00:06:00.840> iron<00:06:01.550> sword

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
so if i wanted to make an iron sword

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.820 
so if i wanted to make an iron sword
like<00:06:03.720> one<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:03.960> these<00:06:04.110> iron<00:06:04.260> swords<00:06:04.650> i<00:06:04.710> would

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
like one of these iron swords i would

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.070 
like one of these iron swords i would
get<00:06:04.950> iron<00:06:05.160> rods<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.940> then<00:06:06.450> i<00:06:06.479> think<00:06:06.690> i<00:06:07.020> would

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
get iron rods and then i think i would

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.260 
get iron rods and then i think i would
need<00:06:07.260> iron<00:06:07.560> ingots<00:06:07.979> so<00:06:08.340> i<00:06:08.520> would<00:06:08.760> go<00:06:08.910> like<00:06:09.060> that

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
need iron ingots so i would go like that

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.020 
need iron ingots so i would go like that
and<00:06:09.570> then<00:06:10.289> there<00:06:11.190> you<00:06:11.280> go<00:06:11.340> there's<00:06:11.729> your<00:06:11.789> honor

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
and then there you go there's your honor

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.090 
and then there you go there's your honor
and<00:06:12.180> sort<00:06:12.389> it's<00:06:12.570> exactly<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.169> same<00:06:13.350> but<00:06:13.650> it

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
and sort it's exactly the same but it

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.800 
and sort it's exactly the same but it
uses<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.789> iron<00:06:14.970> rods<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.389> don't<00:06:15.539> know<00:06:15.600> if<00:06:15.720> these

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
uses the iron rods I don't know if these

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.840 
uses the iron rods I don't know if these
are<00:06:15.870> reinforced<00:06:16.680> more<00:06:16.889> I'm<00:06:17.100> guessing<00:06:17.820> that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850
