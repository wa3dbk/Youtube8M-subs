00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
there so as long as we got to pair it up

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
there so as long as we got to pair it up
let's<00:01:38.280> take<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.670> look<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.780> software<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
let's take a look at the software here

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
let's take a look at the software here
and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> whole<00:01:41.430> bunch<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.030> popups<00:01:42.450> once

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and you get a whole bunch of popups once

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
and you get a whole bunch of popups once
you<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.350> first<00:01:43.649> start<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.340> now

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you have first start up this thing now

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
you have first start up this thing now

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
we're here let's look at the software

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.450 
we're here let's look at the software
android<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.540> dot-to-dot<00:03:11.810> too<00:03:12.380> that's<00:03:12.980> cool<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
android for dot-to-dot too that's cool I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.240 
android for dot-to-dot too that's cool I
would<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:14.090> know<00:03:14.150> anticipate<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> 4-3<00:03:15.680> update

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
would you know anticipate a 4-3 update

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.010 
would you know anticipate a 4-3 update
at<00:03:16.370> some<00:03:16.610> point<00:03:16.880> now<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.540> was<00:03:17.750> talking<00:03:17.990> about

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
at some point now I was talking about

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.900 
at some point now I was talking about
slide<00:03:18.320> aside<00:03:18.560> right<00:03:18.740> so<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.250> their<00:03:19.459> their

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
slide aside right so this is their their

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.550 
slide aside right so this is their their
version<00:03:20.240> of<00:03:20.300> multitasking<00:03:20.750> so<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> launch

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
version of multitasking so you launch

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.680 
version of multitasking so you launch
some<00:03:21.800> apps<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.150> use<00:03:23.360> three<00:03:23.660> fingers

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
some apps and then you use three fingers

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.930 
some apps and then you use three fingers
to<00:03:24.290> shove<00:03:24.770> them<00:03:24.890> over<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.190> side<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:25.850> it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to shove them over the side and then it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.220 
to shove them over the side and then it
kind<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.270> pauses<00:03:26.510> them<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:26.990> they're<00:03:27.110> just

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
kind of pauses them and they're just

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.870 
kind of pauses them and they're just
there<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.160> then<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.490> get<00:03:28.580> them<00:03:28.700> back

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
there and then you can get them back

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.940 
there and then you can get them back
okay<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.810> say<00:03:30.050> that's<00:03:30.140> actually<00:03:30.709> what<00:03:30.860> we

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
okay so you say that's actually what we

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.860 
okay so you say that's actually what we
just<00:03:31.070> did<00:03:31.190> with<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.330> turn<00:03:32.570> it<00:03:32.600> off

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
just did with that if you turn it off

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.500 
just did with that if you turn it off
you<00:03:33.830> will<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.190> get<00:03:34.490> the<00:03:34.640> option<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:35.330> a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
you will then get the option to have a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.680 
you will then get the option to have a
normal<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.980> multitasking<00:03:37.820> right<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.390> we

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
normal just multitasking right so we

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.380 
normal just multitasking right so we
turn<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:38.990> off<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.820> flying<00:03:40.820> back<00:03:40.970> through<00:03:41.240> here

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
turn it off and flying back through here

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.940 
turn it off and flying back through here
let's<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.870> fact<00:03:42.110> launch<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.530> couple<00:03:42.770> apps

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
let's in fact launch a couple apps

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.600 
let's in fact launch a couple apps
launch<00:03:43.700> maps<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.480> have<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> YouTube

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
launch maps and have a YouTube

everything's freaking out because it's
the<00:03:47.630> very<00:03:47.780> first<00:03:48.110> time<00:03:48.320> they've<00:03:48.590> run<00:03:48.950> and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
the very first time they've run and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.270 
the very first time they've run and
that's<00:03:49.610> fine<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.630> come<00:03:51.050> on<00:03:51.170> come<00:03:51.770> on<00:03:51.800> hold<00:03:52.190> it

phone this is but the u.s. phones might
well<00:03:59.930> work<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.200> little<00:04:00.350> different<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:00.770> that

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
well work a little different in that

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
tell you what let's zoom back out for a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.860 
tell you what let's zoom back out for a
second<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.590> bring<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.100> some<00:04:13.580> other<00:04:14.000> siblings

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
second and bring in some other siblings

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.260 
second and bring in some other siblings
right<00:04:15.200> so<00:04:15.440> here<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.830> original<00:04:15.980> LG<00:04:16.820> optimus

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
right so here is the original LG optimus

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.250 
right so here is the original LG optimus
G<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.690> guess<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.169> it's<00:04:18.350> just<00:04:18.560> called<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.830> LG<00:04:19.430> G

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
G I guess now it's just called the LG G

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.420 
G I guess now it's just called the LG G
because<00:04:21.260> they<00:04:21.380> drop<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.770> Optimus<00:04:22.130> name<00:04:22.280> so

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
because they drop the Optimus name so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.590 
because they drop the Optimus name so
you<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.580> see<00:04:22.669> how<00:04:22.700> much<00:04:22.910> bigger<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:23.300> one<00:04:23.450> is

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
you can see how much bigger this one is

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.969 
you can see how much bigger this one is
you<00:04:24.110> know<00:04:24.200> we're<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.530> five<00:04:24.680> point<00:04:24.919> two

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
you know we're up to five point two

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.200
