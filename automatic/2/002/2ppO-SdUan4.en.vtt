00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
commands that explain the permissions so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.120 
commands that explain the permissions so
there's<00:00:26.460> two<00:00:26.699> commands<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> cert<00:00:27.920> in<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
there's two commands in the cert in this

the server name command first and this

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
the server name command first and this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
spaces in it and basically i'll just

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.660 
spaces in it and basically i'll just
change<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> test<00:01:19.439> server<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.580> should

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
change it to test server also I should

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.620 
change it to test server also I should
mention<00:01:20.939> there's<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> character<00:01:22.200> cap<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> 15

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
looking at it now that's probably a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
looking at it now that's probably a
little<00:01:25.860> too<00:01:26.100> short<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.939> might<00:01:27.119> change<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
little too short and I might change it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.830

changes<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> plug-in<00:01:45.840> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
changes it right in the plug-in so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
changes it right in the plug-in so
anyone<00:01:46.560> who<00:01:46.680> logged<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.130> after<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> would

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
anyone who logged in after that would

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
anyone who logged in after that would
see<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> without<00:01:48.509> any<00:01:48.840> reloads<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.159> i<00:01:50.250> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
see it without any reloads so if i just

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.230 
see it without any reloads so if i just
join<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:52.380> server<00:01:52.590> test<00:01:52.979> server<00:01:53.240> you'll

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
join this server test server you'll

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.469 
join this server test server you'll
notice<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.750> says<00:01:54.990> test<00:01:55.229> server<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
notice it now says test server here and

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
notice it now says test server here and
so<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> message<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.649> day<00:01:58.799> command

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so now the message of the day command

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
so now the message of the day command
works<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.240> differently<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.259> more

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
works a little differently and it's more

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
works a little differently and it's more
complicated<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.909> basically<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> web

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
complicated there are basically the web

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
complicated there are basically the web
programs<00:02:04.259> message<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> day<00:02:04.979> there's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
programs message of the day there's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.770 
programs message of the day there's
three<00:02:05.640> lines<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> message<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> day

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
three lines for the message of the day

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
three lines for the message of the day
or<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> use

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
or there can be you don't have to use

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.420 
or there can be you don't have to use
all<00:02:08.340> three<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.479> probably<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.430> each

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
all three but you probably will and each

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.800 
all three but you probably will and each
line<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.239> no<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.599> than

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
line can have no more than

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
line can have no more than
30<00:02:12.959> characters<00:02:13.349> which<00:02:13.950> again<00:02:14.220> looking<00:02:14.550> back

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
30 characters which again looking back

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.580 
30 characters which again looking back
at<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.239> little<00:02:15.510> shorter<00:02:15.959> than<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
at it's a little shorter than it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.199 
at it's a little shorter than it
probably<00:02:16.860> could<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.610> might<00:02:17.790> expand

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
probably could be and I might expand

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.479 
probably could be and I might expand
it's<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.540> 35<00:02:18.870> or<00:02:19.349> 38<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.920> 40<00:02:20.160> or<00:02:20.370> something

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
it's like 35 or 38 or 40 or something

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.199 
it's like 35 or 38 or 40 or something
and<00:02:21.319> basically<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:22.800> type<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.910> first

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and basically you just type in the first

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.699 
and basically you just type in the first
argument<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.819> two<00:02:27.450> or<00:02:27.870> three<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
argument is like one two or three and it

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.580 
argument is like one two or three and it
can<00:02:28.800> only<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
can only be that because that's just to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.780 
can only be that because that's just to
determine<00:02:31.590> what<00:02:31.769> line<00:02:32.010> you'll<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.550> changing

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
determine what line you'll be changing

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.820 
determine what line you'll be changing
from<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> message<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.630> day<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:33.900> setting<00:02:34.260> so

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
from a message of the day or setting so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.150 
from a message of the day or setting so
we'll<00:02:35.040> use<00:02:35.069> one<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:36.680> then<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.130> be

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
we'll use one and then there can be

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.890 
we'll use one and then there can be
spaces<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> message<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.420> I'll<00:02:39.510> say<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
spaces in the message and I'll say this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.540 
spaces in the message and I'll say this
is<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.530> test<00:02:41.209> message<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.720> might<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.140> too<00:02:43.260> long

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
is a test message it might be too long

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.590 
is a test message it might be too long
okay<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.700> wasn't<00:02:44.850> too<00:02:45.060> long<00:02:45.209> because<00:02:45.450> I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
okay that wasn't too long because I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.699 
okay that wasn't too long because I
would<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.780> gotten<00:02:45.900> something<00:02:46.170> about<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.530> not

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
would have gotten something about it not

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.520 
would have gotten something about it not
being<00:02:47.510> about<00:02:48.510> being<00:02:48.780> too<00:02:48.930> long<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.350> did<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
being about being too long if I did that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.170 
being about being too long if I did that
so<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:50.190> we'll<00:02:50.340> say<00:02:51.230> line<00:02:52.230> two<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.230> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
so then we'll say line two and so is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.509 
so then we'll say line two and so is
this<00:02:57.180> or<00:02:57.690> I'll<00:02:58.140> put<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> test<00:02:59.370> message

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
this or I'll put this is a test message

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:08.270 
this or I'll put this is a test message
also<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:02.400> test<00:03:02.970> message<00:03:05.269> also<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.130> also

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
also is a test message also and it also

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.699 
also is a test message also and it also
let<00:03:08.519> me<00:03:08.549> set<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.299> then<00:03:10.110> I'll<00:03:10.230> say<00:03:12.709> this

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
let me set that and then I'll say this

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.740 
let me set that and then I'll say this
is<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:16.080> last<00:03:16.410> line<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:18.209> then<00:03:18.420> maybe<00:03:18.630> in

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
is the last line and then maybe in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.590 
is the last line and then maybe in
parentheses<00:03:19.320> line<00:03:20.280> three<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.450> know<00:03:21.540> if

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
parentheses line three I don't know if

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.420 
parentheses line three I don't know if
that's<00:03:21.750> too<00:03:21.900> long<00:03:22.079> okay<00:03:22.980> yeah<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.250> saying

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that's too long okay yeah it's saying

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.130 
that's too long okay yeah it's saying
it's<00:03:23.579> too<00:03:23.640> long<00:03:23.910> one<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> features<00:03:24.810> i'm

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
it's too long one of the features i'm

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.930 
it's too long one of the features i'm
planning<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.590> adding<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:26.100> it'll<00:03:26.640> tell<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:26.910> how

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
planning on adding is it'll tell you how

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.789 
planning on adding is it'll tell you how
many<00:03:27.329> characters<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.989> was<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.680> how

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
many characters it was so you know how

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.599 
many characters it was so you know how
much<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.069> delete<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.060> i'll<00:03:30.239> say<00:03:30.739> maybe<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.980> 3

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
much to delete so i'll say maybe just 3

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.390 
much to delete so i'll say maybe just 3
in<00:03:32.790> parentheses<00:03:33.470> yep<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:34.739> let<00:03:35.069> me<00:03:35.100> set<00:03:35.370> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
in parentheses yep so now let me set it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.900 
in parentheses yep so now let me set it
and<00:03:35.609> if<00:03:36.420> i<00:03:36.540> disconnect<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.430> hit<00:03:38.430> multiplayer

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and if i disconnect and hit multiplayer

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.229 
and if i disconnect and hit multiplayer
to<00:03:39.090> reconnect<00:03:39.450> again<00:03:40.579> you'll<00:03:41.579> see<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.940> says

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to reconnect again you'll see it says

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.150 
to reconnect again you'll see it says

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
gives you a cool idea of how an

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.710 
gives you a cool idea of how an
interesting<00:03:56.340> idea<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.700> how<00:03:56.819> set<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.480> get<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
interesting idea of how set you get the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.750 
interesting idea of how set you get the
message<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.170> day<00:03:58.319> for<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.650> server<00:03:58.889> and<00:03:59.340> how<00:03:59.639> it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
message a day for your server and how it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.330 
message a day for your server and how it
can<00:03:59.880> figure<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> last<00:04:01.829> thing<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
can figure this and so the last thing is

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.150 
can figure this and so the last thing is
there<00:04:02.790> may<00:04:02.940> be<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.569> case<00:04:03.930> where<00:04:04.319> whatever

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
there may be a case where whatever

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.309 
there may be a case where whatever

don't have any new message of the day
set<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.510> if<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.780> tried<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.859> race<00:04:20.039> it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
set so if you tried to like you race it

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.610 
set so if you tried to like you race it
into<00:04:20.430> something<00:04:20.639> blank<00:04:21.120> by<00:04:21.390> doing<00:04:21.690> motd<00:04:22.320> one

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
into something blank by doing motd one

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.529 
into something blank by doing motd one
it'll<00:04:23.430> say<00:04:23.580> there's<00:04:23.729> not<00:04:23.880> enough<00:04:24.060> parameters

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
it'll say there's not enough parameters

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.560 
it'll say there's not enough parameters
so<00:04:25.110> what<00:04:25.289> you<00:04:25.380> do<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.039> type

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
so what you do is you type

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.900 
so what you do is you type
en<00:04:27.050> PTY<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.310> have<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.580> do<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.790> exactly

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
en PTY and you have to do it exactly

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.420 
en PTY and you have to do it exactly
full<00:04:29.600> caps<00:04:29.870> like<00:04:30.170> that<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.710> empty<00:04:31.190> because<00:04:31.340> I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
full caps like that and empty because I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.680 
full caps like that and empty because I
figured<00:04:31.730> no<00:04:31.880> one<00:04:32.000> would<00:04:32.060> ever<00:04:32.210> have<00:04:32.450> that<00:04:32.600> is

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
figured no one would ever have that is

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.320 
figured no one would ever have that is
their<00:04:32.840> message<00:04:33.200> of<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.380> day<00:04:33.470> line<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:35.060> it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
their message of the day line and so it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.390 
their message of the day line and so it
will<00:04:35.420> recognize<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.440> it'll<00:04:36.950> set<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
will recognize that and it'll set the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.950 
will recognize that and it'll set the
entire<00:04:37.700> file<00:04:38.210> worth<00:04:38.480> storing<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
entire file worth storing the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.990 
entire file worth storing the
information<00:04:39.050> variable<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:40.430> empty<00:04:40.820> and

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
information variable to just empty and

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.930 
information variable to just empty and
so<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.230> or<00:04:42.500> two<00:04:42.620> blank<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:43.640> nothing

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
so then or two blank to nothing

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.550 
so then or two blank to nothing
basically<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:44.840> if<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:44.960> do<00:04:45.140> that<00:04:45.260> with<00:04:45.350> all

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
basically and so if you do that with all

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.320 
basically and so if you do that with all
three<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.890> your<00:04:46.100> lines<00:04:47.830> or<00:04:48.830> like<00:04:49.700> this<00:04:49.970> if<00:04:50.210> you

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
three of your lines or like this if you

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.070 
three of your lines or like this if you
do<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.690> roll<00:04:51.500> three<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.240> then<00:04:53.240> disconnect<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
do it roll three and then disconnect the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.340 
do it roll three and then disconnect the
next<00:04:54.710> person<00:04:55.040> who<00:04:55.070> joins<00:04:55.430> or<00:04:56.300> when<00:04:57.230> I'm
