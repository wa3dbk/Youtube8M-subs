00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
something but that was really scary

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
something but that was really scary
actually<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.750> showed<00:02:01.440> me<00:02:01.650> just<00:02:01.920> how

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
actually and really showed me just how

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.040 
actually and really showed me just how
dangerous<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.240> distracted<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050

definitely<00:02:09.300> definitely<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:10.350> been

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
definitely definitely I think it's been

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.880 
definitely definitely I think it's been

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a really fun day and I think not only

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.290 
a really fun day and I think not only
will<00:02:14.040> they<00:02:14.160> get<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.370> lot<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> enjoyment<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:15.240> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
will they get a lot of enjoyment out of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.270 
will they get a lot of enjoyment out of
it<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:15.840> they'll<00:02:15.990> also<00:02:16.200> come<00:02:16.650> away<00:02:16.950> being<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it but they'll also come away being a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.120 
it but they'll also come away being a
