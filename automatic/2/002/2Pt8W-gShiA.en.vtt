 a lot of space was offside 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.650
 consequently the early leadership

 Bayern now with their best phase, however, then immediately with the 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.529
 Ball loss against Sergio Pinto the free kick he does not get Pinto 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.529

 with 2 4 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.950
 in the lead 62 minutes and of course, Thomas Kraft knew immediately that was mine 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.649
 Kind of ball clear behind the line 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:44.109

 from Rome Robert Zieler 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:08.179
 So that's just on the one hand force with the filter and you prevented 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.969
 Zieler the connection gate for the Bayern 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.659
 It was clear quickly 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.430

 after 87 minutes at the end it remained at 3 2 1 for Hannover 96 a very complete
