00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
in this version they corrected a few of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.230 
in this version they corrected a few of
the<00:02:17.270> problems<00:02:19.630> 13<00:02:20.630> had<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:20.990> problem<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.860> not

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
the problems 13 had a problem with not

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.410 
the problems 13 had a problem with not
giving<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> replay<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.610> miss<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> putt

long<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:27.800> 4<00:02:28.130> feet

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
long over like 4 feet

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.650 
long over like 4 feet
that's<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:29.000> long<00:02:29.440> 3<00:02:30.440> or<00:02:30.530> 4<00:02:30.680> feet<00:02:30.860> past<00:02:31.660> it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that's just long 3 or 4 feet past it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.300 
that's just long 3 or 4 feet past it
didn't<00:02:32.990> replay<00:02:33.350> that's<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.070> things

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
didn't replay that's one of the things

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.000 
didn't replay that's one of the things
but<00:02:34.640> they<00:02:35.150> seem<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.540> fix<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:38.410> they<00:02:39.410> fixed

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
but they seem to fix that and they fixed

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.910 
but they seem to fix that and they fixed
that<00:02:40.720> better<00:02:41.720> replays<00:02:42.230> now<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:45.050> realistic

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that better replays now more realistic

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.620 
that better replays now more realistic
like<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.430> replays<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.940> want<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.240> see<00:02:47.420> like

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
like the replays you want to see like

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.750 
like the replays you want to see like
from<00:02:47.900> TV<00:02:48.200> towers<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.430> would<00:02:49.550> see<00:02:49.730> on

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
from TV towers and what you would see on

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.690 
from TV towers and what you would see on
TV<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.560> they<00:02:51.710> have<00:02:51.800> better<00:02:51.980> replays<00:02:52.460> in<00:02:52.610> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
TV so they have better replays in this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.550 
TV so they have better replays in this
game<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.470> also<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.720> gameplay<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.200> great

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
game and also the gameplay is great

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.120 
game and also the gameplay is great
I<00:02:57.800> like<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.280> gameplay<00:02:59.740> the<00:03:00.740> only<00:03:00.920> thing<00:03:01.070> I

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
I like the gameplay the only thing I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.820 
I like the gameplay the only thing I
don't<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.490> about<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.570> besides<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.560> having

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
don't like about this besides you having

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.940 
don't like about this besides you having
to<00:03:03.920> start<00:03:04.160> your<00:03:04.340> career<00:03:04.820> over<00:03:05.000> from<00:03:05.330> scratch

to start your career over from scratch

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.140 
to start your career over from scratch
which<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.070> might<00:03:07.250> not<00:03:07.400> even<00:03:07.490> do<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> might<00:03:07.970> just

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
which I might not even do I might just

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.630 
which I might not even do I might just
go<00:03:08.240> back<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.660> 13<00:03:09.140> but<00:03:10.010> anyway<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.460> only

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
go back to the 13 but anyway the only

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.850 
go back to the 13 but anyway the only
thing<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:10.940> don't<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:12.290> they<00:03:12.410> messed<00:03:12.680> up

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
thing I don't like that they messed up

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.670 
thing I don't like that they messed up
in<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.100> game<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:15.290> when<00:03:15.530> you're

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
in this game is the but when you're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.890 
in this game is the but when you're
putting<00:03:15.950> when<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.670> make<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> putt<00:03:17.180> like<00:03:17.510> over

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
putting when you make a putt like over

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.030 
putting when you make a putt like over
10<00:03:18.140> feet<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:20.150> goes<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.660> broadcast<00:03:21.260> where

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
10 feet it goes to broadcast where

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.650 
10 feet it goes to broadcast where
sometimes<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.700> can't<00:03:22.910> see<00:03:23.240> if<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.510> going<00:03:23.600> to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
sometimes you can't see if it's going to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.600 
sometimes you can't see if it's going to
go<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:23.959> why<00:03:24.200> doesn't<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.620> stay<00:03:24.860> on<00:03:24.890> follow<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
go in why doesn't it stay on follow the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.750 
go in why doesn't it stay on follow the
ball<00:03:25.820> like<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.360> regular<00:03:27.170> shots<00:03:27.440> do<00:03:27.709> for<00:03:28.550> some

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
ball like the regular shots do for some

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.410 
ball like the regular shots do for some
reason<00:03:29.180> they<00:03:30.170> don't<00:03:30.410> allow<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.240> stay<00:03:32.240> on

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
reason they don't allow it to stay on

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.110 
reason they don't allow it to stay on
the<00:03:32.570> ball<00:03:32.780> where<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.380> can<00:03:33.560> like<00:03:33.880> 2013<00:03:34.880> did<00:03:35.060> a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the ball where you can like 2013 did a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.180 
the ball where you can like 2013 did a
great<00:03:35.390> view<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.020> putt<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.770> was<00:03:36.890> like<00:03:37.070> you

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
great view of the putt it was like you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.800 
great view of the putt it was like you
were<00:03:37.280> really<00:03:37.640> putting<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.270> you<00:03:38.510> didn't<00:03:38.720> know

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
were really putting and you didn't know

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.320 
were really putting and you didn't know
whether<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.050> was<00:03:39.140> gonna<00:03:39.290> go<00:03:39.860> in<00:03:40.010> or<00:03:40.160> not<00:03:40.330> but

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
whether it was gonna go in or not but

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.810 
whether it was gonna go in or not but
this<00:03:41.570> year<00:03:41.989> they<00:03:42.680> changed<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.520> messed

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
this year they changed that and messed

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.400 
this year they changed that and messed
it<00:03:44.000> up<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.810> any<00:03:44.989> putts<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.739> say<00:03:46.520> over<00:03:46.820> 10<00:03:47.030> feet

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it up so any putts like say over 10 feet

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.610 
it up so any putts like say over 10 feet
it<00:03:48.410> shows<00:03:49.270> who<00:03:50.270> knows<00:03:50.480> what<00:03:50.840> angle<00:03:51.230> they'll

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it shows who knows what angle they'll

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.470 
it shows who knows what angle they'll
show<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.610> doesn't<00:03:52.910> show<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.360> they

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
show but it doesn't show it like they

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.860 
show but it doesn't show it like they
did<00:03:53.660> in<00:03:53.750> 2013<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.830> that's<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.130> drawback<00:03:55.870> other

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
did in 2013 so that's the drawback other

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.090 
did in 2013 so that's the drawback other
than<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.840> good<00:04:00.200> game<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.410> far

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
than that it's a good game so far

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.760 
than that it's a good game so far
it's<00:04:01.940> harder<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.600> they<00:04:03.440> have<00:04:03.590> different

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
it's harder and they have different

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.010 
it's harder and they have different
skill<00:04:04.220> levels<00:04:04.640> experts<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.450> stuff<00:04:05.630> like<00:04:05.810> that

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
skill levels experts and stuff like that

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.720 
skill levels experts and stuff like that
which<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.860> because<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.160> like<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.580> be

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
which I like because I like it to be

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.650 
which I like because I like it to be
more<00:04:07.970> realistic<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.450> that's<00:04:11.630> good<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:13.660> my

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
more realistic so that's good and my

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.479 
more realistic so that's good and my
main<00:04:14.930> complaint<00:04:15.320> though<00:04:15.440> is<00:04:15.590> having<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.220> start

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
main complaint though is having to start

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.949 
main complaint though is having to start
your<00:04:16.669> whole<00:04:16.970> career<00:04:17.419> over<00:04:18.200> again<00:04:18.500> from

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
your whole career over again from

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.890 
your whole career over again from
and<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:19.859> ridiculous<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.910> know

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and that's that's ridiculous you know
