00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
use the bottom and then then we're going

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.730 
use the bottom and then then we're going
to<00:02:15.510> take<00:02:15.840> our<00:02:17.090> washing<00:02:18.090> soda<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.020> our<00:02:19.170> borax

to take our washing soda and our borax

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.560 
to take our washing soda and our borax
and<00:02:20.010> we're<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> add<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.120> our<00:02:21.150> soap

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and we're going to add that to our soap

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.910 
and we're going to add that to our soap
and<00:02:21.870> water<00:02:22.170> mixture<00:02:24.320> okay<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.380> we're<00:02:25.740> going<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and water mixture okay so we're going to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.550 
and water mixture okay so we're going to

add our washing soda and our borax to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.430 
add our washing soda and our borax to
our<00:02:28.680> mixture<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.480> three<00:02:30.990> fourths

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
our mixture and you it's three fourths

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130 
our mixture and you it's three fourths
cup<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.890> each<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:33.300> you're<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.930> add

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
cup of each and you're going to just add

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.449 
cup of each and you're going to just add
it<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.920> there<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.490> stir<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> you're

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
it right in there and stir it so you're

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.110 
it right in there and stir it so you're
going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.640> stir<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.060> till<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.250> dissolved

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.940 

and<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.270> takes<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.750> few<00:02:45.959> minutes<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.680> you'll

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
and it takes a few minutes and you'll

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.550 
and it takes a few minutes and you'll
notice<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.580> getting<00:02:47.910> thicker<00:02:48.240> as<00:02:48.540> well

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.770 

and<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:53.040> forget<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.430> turn<00:02:53.970> off<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.510> heat

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
and don't forget to turn off the heat

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:08.760 
and don't forget to turn off the heat
each<00:02:55.620> should<00:02:55.890> not<00:02:56.100> be<00:02:56.310> on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.460 

okay<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.640> should<00:03:09.850> look<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.600> it's

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
okay so it should look like this it's

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.170 
okay so it should look like this it's
getting<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.890> little<00:03:12.040> bit<00:03:12.310> thicker<00:03:12.520> but<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.000> can

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
getting a little bit thicker but you can

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.870 
getting a little bit thicker but you can
tell<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.870> all<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.950> washing<00:03:15.430> soda<00:03:15.700> and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
tell that that all the washing soda and

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.980 
tell that that all the washing soda and
the<00:03:15.970> borax<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.540> dissolved<00:03:17.200> into<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.970> mixture

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
the borax is dissolved into the mixture

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.080 
the borax is dissolved into the mixture
and<00:03:19.990> then<00:03:22.500> assault<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:24.580> you're<00:03:24.850> going<00:03:25.000> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
and then assault then you're going to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.540 
and then assault then you're going to
add<00:03:25.150> four<00:03:25.990> cups<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.740> hot<00:03:27.990> hot<00:03:28.990> water<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:31.090> this

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
add four cups of hot hot water to this

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.040 
add four cups of hot hot water to this
so<00:03:33.550> we're<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.910> add<00:03:34.030> four<00:03:34.390> cups<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.870> hot

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
so we're going to add four cups of hot

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:46.340 
so we're going to add four cups of hot
water<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:40.710> then<00:03:41.710> we're<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.280> stir<00:03:42.700> it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.710 

and<00:03:47.350> then<00:03:47.620> our<00:03:47.770> next<00:03:47.800> step<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> dump<00:03:49.330> all<00:03:50.610> is

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
and then our next step is to dump all is

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.080 
and then our next step is to dump all is
to<00:03:52.720> dump<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.140> mixture<00:03:53.770> into<00:03:54.070> our<00:03:54.280> bucket<00:03:54.760> and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
to dump this mixture into our bucket and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.850 
to dump this mixture into our bucket and
then<00:03:55.660> add<00:03:55.930> more<00:03:56.200> water<00:03:58.470> okay<00:03:59.470> so<00:03:59.530> now<00:03:59.830> that

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
then add more water okay so now that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.550 
then add more water okay so now that
everything<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.460> dissolved<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.660> everything

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
everything is dissolved and everything

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.370 
everything is dissolved and everything
it's<00:04:02.710> heated<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.520> becomes<00:04:04.000> thicker<00:04:04.420> we're

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
it's heated and it becomes thicker we're

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.080 
it's heated and it becomes thicker we're
going<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.530> go<00:04:05.710> ahead<00:04:05.740> and<00:04:06.100> take<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.580> mixture

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
going to go ahead and take the mixture

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.610 
going to go ahead and take the mixture
and<00:04:07.300> we're<00:04:07.420> going<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.600> pour<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.930> into<00:04:08.080> art<00:04:08.350> a

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
and we're going to pour it into art a

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.770 
and we're going to pour it into art a
five-gallon<00:04:09.250> bucket<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.880> then<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:10.660> going

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
five-gallon bucket and then we're going

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.800 
five-gallon bucket and then we're going
to<00:04:10.900> add<00:04:10.960> a<00:04:11.350> gallon<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.250> half<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.550> water<00:04:13.300> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
to add a gallon and a half of water and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.530 
to add a gallon and a half of water and
what's<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.040> happen<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.580> over<00:04:15.910> time<00:04:16.180> it's

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
what's going to happen is over time it's

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.880 
what's going to happen is over time it's
going<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.870> gel<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.280> becomes<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.850> gel<00:04:19.209> and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
going to gel so it becomes a gel and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.130 
going to gel so it becomes a gel and
you'll<00:04:20.890> notice<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.310> tomorrow<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.900> takes

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
you'll notice that tomorrow it takes

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.000 
you'll notice that tomorrow it takes
like<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> full<00:04:23.710> day<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.360> gets<00:04:25.620> kind<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.680> thick

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
like a full day it gets kind of thick

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.970 
like a full day it gets kind of thick
and<00:04:27.450> for<00:04:28.450> high-efficiency<00:04:28.960> wash<00:04:29.530> machines

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
and for high-efficiency wash machines

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.760 
and for high-efficiency wash machines
like<00:04:30.160> mine<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:31.810> may<00:04:31.990> want<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:32.260> add<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.470> little

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
like mine you may want to add a little

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.550 
like mine you may want to add a little
water<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:34.240> mixture<00:04:34.270> when<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.050> add<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.410> to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
water to the mixture when you add it to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.430 
water to the mixture when you add it to
your<00:04:35.650> machine<00:04:35.830> or<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.810> sometimes<00:04:37.810> use<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.080> whisk

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
your machine or I sometimes use a whisk

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.430 
your machine or I sometimes use a whisk
and<00:04:38.860> i<00:04:39.610> will<00:04:39.850> just<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.360> my<00:04:40.570> five<00:04:40.810> gallon<00:04:41.140> bucket

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
and i will just in my five gallon bucket

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.410 
and i will just in my five gallon bucket
I'll<00:04:41.590> just<00:04:41.800> whisk<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.370> so<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.880> all<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.180> big

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
I'll just whisk it so that all the big

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.260 
I'll just whisk it so that all the big
chunks<00:04:43.980> become<00:04:44.980> dissolved<00:04:45.610> or<00:04:45.970> are<00:04:46.150> they

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
chunks become dissolved or are they

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.800 
chunks become dissolved or are they
become<00:04:46.630> smaller<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:49.330> we're<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.720> go

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
become smaller so we're going to go

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.110 
become smaller so we're going to go
ahead<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.170> do<00:04:50.440> that<00:04:50.700> we're<00:04:51.700> just<00:04:51.790> going<00:04:52.030> to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
ahead and do that we're just going to
