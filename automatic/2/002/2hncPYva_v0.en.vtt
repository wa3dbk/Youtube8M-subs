00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 practically football rescues you 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.930

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:18.120
 idea my illusion and my desire as I 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.120
 I see minimum minimum for this year 2013 1 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 but to achieve it you have to draw 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.200
 conditions that go beyond what 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.200
 it happens on the court 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.580

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.650
 Government projects by Marcelo Ebrard 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.870
 guarantee food in the dining rooms 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.820
 popular uniform and in some cases 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.090
 another type of orientation 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.530
 the first put to educate them 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.260
 because many of them come from neighborhoods 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.770

 division 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.680
 but going out to play every week is a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.870
 challenge the federal deputy of the perredé 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 fernando zárate and the assemblywoman of pt 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.860

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540
 with the six thousand pesos of arbitration that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.640
 they are needed when they play from the premises 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.740
 But this is not enough 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.030

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.940

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.480
 make the team bigger and like in 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.550
 all teams each have their own 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.250
 goals your goals your functions very 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.330
 well clear you know what they have 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.060
 what to do we know what 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.770
 we have to do so that we all continue 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.390
 winning we keep growing as a team 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.970
 Sometimes we need some support 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.870
 economic because it would not reach us 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.950
 when we can eat or something 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.140
 Studies some shoes like suffers 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 a lot of transport shoes too 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.840
 the courts that the most important thing what 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.819
 paramount in our team as 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.549
 I will run a little is rising 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.230
 much dust because we breathe everything and 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.239
 Well that hurts them a lot 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.099
 however the sports authorities 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.870
 in the city they are not clear about the future 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.140
 of the team as part of their projects 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.299
 is a team that does not properly 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.849
 belongs to the institute of sport is 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.129
 more if you ask me do not exist there is no 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.840
 contract as such with a team not 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.700
 there is a payroll paid with the equipment not 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.220
 there is that type is rather a support that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.840
 gave the institute of sport to a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.790
 team called the action angels of 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.379
 gmexico and good will have to be explored 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.689
 just if it is something that suits us 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.400
 continue to support or not 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.739
 and while this is defined the angels 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.970
 they are still concentrated in the game 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.980
 currently occupy the fourth place in the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.780
 general table of the third division with 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.700
 high possibility of reaching the liguilla 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.019

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.019
