if that works
that<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.490> seems<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.880> work<00:04:54.090> like<00:04:54.390> turning

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
that that seems to work like turning

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.450 
that that seems to work like turning
them<00:04:54.900> off<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.470> then<00:04:55.560> turning<00:04:55.860> them<00:04:56.040> back<00:04:56.100> on

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.080 
them off and then turning them back on
and<00:04:56.820> then<00:04:57.810> they'll<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:58.310> be<00:04:59.310> more<00:04:59.460> sensitive

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and then they'll like be more sensitive

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.110 
and then they'll like be more sensitive
that<00:05:00.120> way<00:05:01.490> see<00:05:02.490> they<00:05:02.610> even<00:05:02.640> move<00:05:03.000> by

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that way see they even move by

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.740 
that way see they even move by
themselves

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.820

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.190 

okay<00:05:46.650> well<00:05:47.650> as<00:05:47.830> you<00:05:47.920> can<00:05:48.160> see<00:05:48.540> it's<00:05:49.540> been<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.870> lie

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
okay well as you can see it's been a lie

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.350 
okay well as you can see it's been a lie
if<00:05:50.980> they<00:05:51.190> don't<00:05:51.400> really<00:05:51.580> dance

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
if they don't really dance

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.870 
if they don't really dance
I<00:05:52.390> mean<00:05:53.200> indeed<00:05:53.470> I<00:05:53.830> don't<00:05:54.220> know<00:05:54.520> what's<00:05:54.700> wrong

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
I mean indeed I don't know what's wrong

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.790 
I mean indeed I don't know what's wrong
with<00:05:54.940> them<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.540> guess<00:05:55.750> if<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.990> push<00:05:56.230> the<00:05:56.380> button

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
with them I guess if you push the button

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.340 
with them I guess if you push the button
they<00:05:56.920> do<00:05:56.980> move<00:05:57.420> but<00:05:58.420> they<00:05:58.570> don't<00:05:58.780> really<00:05:59.020> move

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
they do move but they don't really move

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.700 
they do move but they don't really move
