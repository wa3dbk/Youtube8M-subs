review first up his pace has been

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400 
review first up his pace has been
increased<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.640> ton<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> mean<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> ton

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
increased by a ton now when I mean a ton

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190 
increased by a ton now when I mean a ton
his<00:00:43.710> acceleration<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.700> increased<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
his acceleration has increased a lot and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930 
his acceleration has increased a lot and
you<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.559> feel<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.100> definitely<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you will feel this definitely on the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
you will feel this definitely on the
pitch<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> soon<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.690> he<00:00:48.780> touches<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> ball<00:00:49.410> he

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pitch as soon as he touches the ball he

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
pitch as soon as he touches the ball he
becomes<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.700> Sonic<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:51.930> does<00:00:52.110> tend

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
becomes like Sonic but then he does tend

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
becomes like Sonic but then he does tend
to<00:00:52.500> slow<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.129> he<00:00:53.399> does<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.879> have

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to slow down because he does only have

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270 
to slow down because he does only have
80<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.870> sprint<00:00:55.350> speed<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> does<00:00:56.070> feel

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
80 for sprint speed but it does feel

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
80 for sprint speed but it does feel
foster<00:00:56.730> than<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.300> he's<00:00:57.539> only<00:00:57.719> 5

amazing<00:02:30.420> reactions<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.050> soon<00:02:31.230> as<00:02:31.320> he<00:02:31.410> falls

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
amazing reactions as soon as he falls

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
amazing reactions as soon as he falls
down<00:02:31.740> he<00:02:32.250> gets<00:02:32.490> back<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.150> tries<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.570> fight

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
down he gets back up and tries to fight

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.960 
down he gets back up and tries to fight
his<00:02:34.020> way<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.010> he<00:02:35.250> has<00:02:35.430> amazing

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
his way on to go and he has amazing

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.310 
his way on to go and he has amazing
bands<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.690> probably<00:02:36.930> what<00:02:37.170> makes

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
bands and this is probably what makes

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960 
bands and this is probably what makes
him<00:02:37.470> feel<00:02:37.590> stronger<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.220> game<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.460> think<00:02:38.580> he<00:02:38.850> has

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
him feel stronger in game I think he has

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.200 
him feel stronger in game I think he has
99<00:02:39.510> balance<00:02:40.350> which<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.880> amazing<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.030> use

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
99 balance which is amazing to use

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.240 
99 balance which is amazing to use
against<00:02:42.660> defenders<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.260> he<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.040> actually

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
against defenders and he is actually

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.480 
against defenders and he is actually
cheap<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:45.180> an<00:02:45.270> 87<00:02:46.080> overall<00:02:46.680> player<00:02:47.010> he's

can<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.180> played<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.420> various<00:03:09.900> positions<00:03:10.050> i

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
can be played in various positions i

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.900 
can be played in various positions i
played<00:03:10.709> them<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> striker<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:11.700> he<00:03:11.790> has

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
played them as a striker because he has

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.430 
played them as a striker because he has
perfect<00:03:12.330> workers<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> striker<00:03:13.140> he<00:03:13.320> has

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
perfect workers for a striker he has

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440 
perfect workers for a striker he has
high<00:03:13.620> attacking<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.220> low<00:03:14.580> defending<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.390> you

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
high attacking a low defending so you

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.000 
high attacking a low defending so you
can<00:03:15.660> pretty<00:03:15.840> much<00:03:15.900> play<00:03:16.170> him<00:03:16.320> anywhere<00:03:16.410> his

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
can pretty much play him anywhere his

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
can pretty much play him anywhere his
passing<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.700> simply<00:03:18.180> amazing<00:03:18.570> has<00:03:18.959> he's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
passing is simply amazing has he's

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.870 
passing is simply amazing has he's
probably<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.980> best<00:03:20.130> pauses<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.670> this

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
probably one of the best pauses in this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.270 
probably one of the best pauses in this
game<00:03:21.090> as<00:03:21.209> well<00:03:21.390> his<00:03:21.780> crossing<00:03:22.290> i<00:03:22.380> think<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.709> 99

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
and i think that is pretty much it his

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.070 
and i think that is pretty much it his
finishing<00:03:32.760> doesn't<00:03:33.300> do<00:03:33.390> him<00:03:33.480> justice<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.959> this

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080
