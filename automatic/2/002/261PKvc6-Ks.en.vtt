this is the Nautilus from Pegasus kids

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.200 
this is the Nautilus from Pegasus kids
fantastic<00:00:05.870> straightforward<00:00:06.870> bill<00:00:08.210> started

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
fantastic straightforward bill started

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
fantastic straightforward bill started
with<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> salon<00:00:13.099> got<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.370> painted<00:00:16.250> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
with the salon got it all painted and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:30.620 
with the salon got it all painted and
applied<00:00:17.609> washes

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.140 

the<00:00:31.630> side<00:00:31.869> of<00:00:32.080> the<00:00:32.140> hole<00:00:32.580> these<00:00:33.580> parts<00:00:33.910> here

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
the side of the hole these parts here

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.320 
the side of the hole these parts here
are<00:00:34.390> two<00:00:35.110> pieces<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:36.220> they<00:00:36.790> have<00:00:36.940> locator

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
are two pieces and they have locator

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.479 
are two pieces and they have locator
pins<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:39.450> cut<00:00:40.450> them<00:00:40.660> off<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.250> could<00:00:42.400> have

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
pins I cut them off and so I could have

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.590 
pins I cut them off and so I could have
more<00:00:42.640> flush<00:00:43.000> fit<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.850> clear<00:00:46.090> parts<00:00:46.449> you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
more flush fit for the clear parts you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.910 
more flush fit for the clear parts you
do<00:00:46.750> get<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.260> kit<00:00:48.190> supplied<00:00:48.610> mask<00:00:49.920> time

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
do get a kit supplied mask time

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.160 
do get a kit supplied mask time
consuming<00:00:53.580> once<00:00:54.580> I<00:00:54.730> got<00:00:54.910> them<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.269> we<00:00:55.840> have<00:00:56.080> to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
consuming once I got them on we have to

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.500 
consuming once I got them on we have to
shoot<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.410> little<00:00:56.559> future<00:00:56.980> over<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:58.030> no

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
shoot a little future over it so no

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.590 
shoot a little future over it so no
paint<00:00:58.870> bleed<00:00:59.489> go<00:01:00.489> in<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.910> want<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.300> light<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
paint bleed go in I do want to light the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.460 
paint bleed go in I do want to light the
kid<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.600> kind<00:01:07.869> of<00:01:07.899> had<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.050> take<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
kid so I kind of had to take a little

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.999 
kid so I kind of had to take a little
liberty<00:01:08.649> on<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.220> backside<00:01:09.729> I<00:01:10.890> drilled<00:01:11.890> out

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
liberty on the backside I drilled out

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.740 
liberty on the backside I drilled out
some<00:01:12.250> channels<00:01:13.050> shows<00:01:14.050> some<00:01:14.259> LEDs<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.720> LEDs<00:01:16.720> I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
some channels shows some LEDs in LEDs I

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.810 
some channels shows some LEDs in LEDs I
hit<00:01:17.110> right<00:01:17.320> there<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:19.270> either<00:01:19.600> side<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.670> that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
hit right there on either side and that

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.920 
hit right there on either side and that
was<00:01:25.119> gonna<00:01:25.420> light<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.990> top<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.119> salon<00:01:31.510> I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
was gonna light the top of the salon I

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.850 
was gonna light the top of the salon I
decided<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:35.020> really<00:01:35.229> wasn't<00:01:35.409> enough<00:01:35.710> light<00:01:36.040> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
decided it really wasn't enough light so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
decided it really wasn't enough light so
I'm<00:01:38.860> gonna<00:01:39.040> go<00:01:39.220> from<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:40.500> side<00:01:43.259> should<00:01:44.259> be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I'm gonna go from the side should be

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
I'm gonna go from the side should be
left<00:01:45.610> light<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.030> there<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.600> either<00:01:47.020> side

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.919 

and<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.700> five<00:01:58.000> LEDs<00:02:00.750> that'll<00:02:01.750> light

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
and that's just five LEDs that'll light

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.300 
and that's just five LEDs that'll light
this<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:05.289> alligator<00:02:05.770> eyes<00:02:06.009> very<00:02:06.759> much<00:02:07.060> room

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
this the alligator eyes very much room

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.339 
this the alligator eyes very much room
so<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:09.459> I'm<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.849> do<00:02:10.030> let's<00:02:11.019> get<00:02:11.170> some

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
so what I'm going to do let's get some

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.530 
so what I'm going to do let's get some
thick<00:02:11.650> fiber-optic<00:02:12.430> cable<00:02:12.790> run<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
thick fiber-optic cable run to the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.900 
thick fiber-optic cable run to the
searchlight<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.560> alligator<00:02:15.069> eyes<00:02:15.280> just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
searchlight and the alligator eyes just

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.320 
searchlight and the alligator eyes just
drill<00:02:16.709> three<00:02:17.709> holes<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.280> run<00:02:18.430> three<00:02:18.760> fiber

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
drill three holes and run three fiber

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.520 
drill three holes and run three fiber
optics<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:24.720> next<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.870> I'll<00:02:26.260> get<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
optics to there next up I'll get the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
optics to there next up I'll get the
hole<00:02:26.680> together<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:28.120> them<00:02:28.299> in<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:30.420> rock<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
hole together get them in and rock and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.780 
hole together get them in and rock and
roll
