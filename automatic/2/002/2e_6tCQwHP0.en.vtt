00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
let me doing a product review today if a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.690 
let me doing a product review today if a
comparison<00:00:03.990> between<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.290> Astro<00:00:04.710> 830<00:00:05.190> headset

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
comparison between the Astro 830 headset

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.820 
comparison between the Astro 830 headset
right<00:00:05.879> here<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.359> astro<00:00:06.810> a40<00:00:07.200> headset<00:00:07.290> right

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
right here and astro a40 headset right

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.709 
right here and astro a40 headset right
there<00:00:08.040> first<00:00:08.730> thing<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.240> see<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
there first thing you can see as I

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.950 
there first thing you can see as I
switching<00:00:10.200> between<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.620> two<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
switching between the two is that the a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.240 
switching between the two is that the a
40s<00:00:13.860> dwarf<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> 30s<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:15.830> they<00:00:16.830> are

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
40s dwarf the a 30s because they are

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.220 
40s dwarf the a 30s because they are
around<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.210> ear<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.720> they're<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> be

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
around the ear so they're going to be

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
around the ear so they're going to be
larger<00:00:19.710> since<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> 830<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.640> only<00:00:20.730> fit<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.029> top

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
larger since the 830 is only fit on top

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.470 
larger since the 830 is only fit on top
of<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> ear<00:00:21.720> I'd<00:00:22.650> say<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.699> making<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.150> simple

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
of the ear I'd say just making it simple

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.589 
of the ear I'd say just making it simple
for<00:00:24.510> everyone<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.380> prefer<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> forties<00:00:26.789> just

here there we go is you know if you just

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
here there we go is you know if you just
take<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> away<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> too

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
take it away you don't really see it too

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.410 
take it away you don't really see it too
bad<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> but

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bad and you can kind of see that but

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
bad and you can kind of see that but
doesn't<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.829> can't<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
doesn't you can't really like think of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.170 
doesn't you can't really like think of
it<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.039> 40's<00:00:59.820> could<00:01:00.030> put

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it and then there's the a 40's could put

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
it and then there's the a 40's could put
the<00:01:00.300> tag<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> whole<00:01:01.980> bit

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the tag on it doesn't have the whole bit

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.950 
the tag on it doesn't have the whole bit
don't<00:01:02.579> feel<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.969> trading<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.739> so

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
don't feel like we're trading it so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
don't feel like we're trading it so
let's<00:01:06.960> say<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> weight<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.430> 40<00:01:08.939> s<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
let's say the weight of that a 40 s is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.550 
let's say the weight of that a 40 s is
probably<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.450> twice<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> weight<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> 8

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
probably about twice the weight of the 8

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
probably about twice the weight of the 8
30<00:01:10.890> s<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.820> sound<00:01:14.820> installations<00:01:15.540> about

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
30 s and the sound installations about

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640 
30 s and the sound installations about
the<00:01:16.320> same<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:18.049> tightness<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the same the tightness that you can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
the same the tightness that you can
adjust<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.040> headset<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.460> better<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> 40s

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
adjust the headset is better on the 40s

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.749 
adjust the headset is better on the 40s
because<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.259> completely<00:01:23.009> free<00:01:23.430> system

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because it's a completely free system

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
because it's a completely free system
instead<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.150> having<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.600> knotted<00:01:25.590> sightings

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
instead of having like knotted sightings

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.490 
instead of having like knotted sightings
such<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> could<00:01:28.140> hear<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> like

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
such as that as you could hear it like

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.100 
such as that as you could hear it like
kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.920> dented<00:01:29.520> oh<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.820> say

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
kind of just dented oh and I just say

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
kind of just dented oh and I just say
the<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.409> 40s<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:34.979> stay<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.549> head<00:01:35.729> better

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the a 40s they stay on your head better

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.280 
the a 40s they stay on your head better
if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.600> lean<00:01:37.350> forward<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> generally<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
if you lean forward but generally I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
if you lean forward but generally I
would<00:01:43.409> say<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.850> better

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
would say that if what is just a better

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.870 
would say that if what is just a better
headset<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.530> will<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.979> paying<00:01:47.189> more<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.520> them

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
headset you will be paying more for them

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.950 
headset you will be paying more for them
but<00:01:48.170> after<00:01:49.170> you're<00:01:49.320> paying<00:01:49.860> about<00:01:50.960> two-three

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but after you're paying about two-three

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
but after you're paying about two-three
hundred<00:01:51.990> dollars<00:01:52.560> app<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.579> complete

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
hundred dollars app for the complete

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
hundred dollars app for the complete
audio<00:01:54.210> system<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:55.229> extra<00:01:55.649> twenty<00:01:55.979> dollars

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
audio system an extra twenty dollars

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.859 
audio system an extra twenty dollars
isn't<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> make<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.450> difference

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
isn't going to make much of a difference

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.090 
isn't going to make much of a difference
so<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.729> just<00:01:59.729> say<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> 40s<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.250> um<00:02:02.899> there

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
so I just say go for a 40s so um there

so I just say go for a 40s so um there
have<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> better<00:02:05.399> fit<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.930> sound<00:02:07.229> quality<00:02:07.409> on

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
have a better fit the sound quality on

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
have a better fit the sound quality on
them<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> probably<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
them is probably I would say just the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.480 
them is probably I would say just the
same<00:02:10.129> but

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
same but

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.140 
same but
a displacement<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> speakers<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.940> put

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
a displacement of the speakers we put

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.170 
a displacement of the speakers we put
this<00:02:15.240> into<00:02:15.420> perspective<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:17.460> better<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
this into perspective is is better on a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
this into perspective is is better on a
40<00:02:18.630> s<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.710> see<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> got

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
40 s because as you can see here you got

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.100 
40 s because as you can see here you got
maybe<00:02:21.210> about<00:02:21.410> three<00:02:22.410> inches<00:02:22.830> or<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.060> room<00:02:24.960> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
maybe about three inches or so room to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.300 
maybe about three inches or so room to
put<00:02:25.260> speakers<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> got<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> got

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
put speakers and you got here you got

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.190 
put speakers and you got here you got
two<00:02:26.460> inches<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.240> able<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.690> speakers

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
two inches it's able to have speakers

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.750 
two inches it's able to have speakers
further<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.010> than<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.140> people<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.640> are

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
further out than that so people that are

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.730 
further out than that so people that are
behind<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.180> will<00:02:33.360> sound<00:02:33.600> further<00:02:34.230> behind<00:02:34.440> you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
behind you will sound further behind you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.400 
behind you will sound further behind you
in<00:02:34.860> footsteps<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.930> people<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.020> front<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.320> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
in footsteps and people in front of you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.840 
in footsteps and people in front of you
will<00:02:37.560> send<00:02:37.710> for<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.100> front<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.790> course

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
will send for the front of you of course

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.410 
will send for the front of you of course
so<00:02:40.100> I'm<00:02:41.100> saying<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.850> you're<00:02:41.970> playing<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
so I'm saying if you're playing a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.990 
so I'm saying if you're playing a
shooter<00:02:42.750> game<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:44.100> will<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.580> more<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.880> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
shooter game you will have more of a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210 
shooter game you will have more of a
surround<00:02:45.750> sound<00:02:45.900> type<00:02:46.380> advantage<00:02:46.920> while

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
surround sound type advantage while

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.730 
surround sound type advantage while
using<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> hey<00:02:47.760> 40s<00:02:48.270> because<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.320> speakers

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
using the hey 40s because the speakers

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.630 
using the hey 40s because the speakers
are<00:02:49.920> further<00:02:50.750> away<00:02:51.750> from<00:02:52.440> each<00:02:52.740> other<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
are further away from each other so the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.810 
are further away from each other so the
sounds<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.270> more<00:02:54.420> defined<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.190> you

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
sounds are more defined but if you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.050 
sounds are more defined but if you
actually<00:02:57.030> space<00:02:57.540> teach<00:02:57.780> each<00:02:58.530> speaker<00:02:58.950> out<00:02:59.280> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
actually space teach each speaker out it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.560 
actually space teach each speaker out it
would<00:03:00.300> probably<00:03:00.510> sound<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> same<00:03:01.380> I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
would probably sound just the same I

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.680 
would probably sound just the same I
just<00:03:03.570> that's<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.800> for<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> 40s<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.000> you're

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
just that's I go for the a 40s if you're

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.140
