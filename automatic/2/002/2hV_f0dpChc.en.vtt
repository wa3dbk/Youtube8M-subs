00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 howard droids how are you all right 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 all right welcome a new video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 today we will make monkeys I bring a news that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.540
 it's pretty amazing so he decided 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 that would be quite interesting 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 share it that is basically death 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 of the nexus range said as it seems 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 very tragic and this is based on some 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.880
 leaks that have come out and that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 presumably and it's almost certain that they will 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.010
 come to light in the google input output 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.859
 that will be carried out in two months 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.050
 on June 25 and 26 and consisting of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 the birth of a new project a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.790
 new generation of devices that are 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 the android silver which is android silver 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 as I said is the next step of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.520
 nexus range that as you know were about 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.260
 devices that were very good 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 quality-price but they had two 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
 failures first were not to diet 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 internationally and then not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 they could buy through google play 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.039
 the points in favor of the new 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 Android silver generation that I have to 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 say that he will not carry out a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.520
 manufacturer but it will be like a stamp or 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 Silver license that will be able to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 grant to various devices and that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.130
 obviously will share let's say the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.590
 advantages that had the Nexus range is 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.850
 the point of the software is that they will come with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.039
 pure android without layers of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.470
 customization and that obviously then 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.289
 they will be the lightest and fastest 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.689
 then as I said this range has 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.820
 two advantages that is international and that 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.590
 can be purchased in stores and also 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.929
 they are making deals with the operators 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.880
 since we do not do it 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.799
 but there are many people to the majority that in 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.679
 time to buy a device lets 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.569
 the operators give away the device 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.490
 so this, let's say there is 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.170
 one way favors everyone in any 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.270
 case there is always a doubt that we 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.310
 will end up jumping and is if it will maintain the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.619
 point of the quality price and that is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.049
 between the nexus and android silver range 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.270
 there have been tests, let's say in the USA 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.549
 that will sound that is the devices 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.349
 google play that were let's say the by 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.179
 example of that 4 or the experience is 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.520
 one with a touch device range of 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.740
 any brand and put pure android 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.259
 put your new ruling on one side that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.299
 it was only available in the USA and then 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.250
 the price and so they shared the price with 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.840
 his twin brother is saying devices 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.519
 that they were already quite price 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160
 then these new devices 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.500
 android silver have two points 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.810
 it has leaked that google will choose 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.630
 on what devices they consider 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.880
 better this category will be available 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.500
 and this implies not necessarily about 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.450
 the high ranges but the most 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.060
 interesting for example in the case of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.070
 samsung then I could choose the s5 in the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.100
 case of sony the zeta 2 but also the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.040
 z1 compact for a device of a 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.050
 size a little smaller and they say that 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 they are going to make suspensions with which they 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.430
 can understand that we say pay the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.230
 part of that removes a little margin of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.240
 benefit to the brand so that it 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 reduce the prices to those who o more 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.650
 least now we have in mind what 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.570
 we think about the nexus range then like 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.610
 I say this is going to say surely in 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.040
 the wing input output in two months 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.140
 but it will be applicable within a time 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 whereupon most likely in 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.000
 Any case in this same event is 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.010
 come to light the new nexus 7 as well as 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.290
 probably and let's wait two the nexus 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 10 that already already has a one 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.950
 renovation to screams not then 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.570
 I basically wanted to comment on this news 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.310
 and that leaves me here below in the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.660
 comments your opinion about it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610
 since it is a subject at least 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.850
 interesting not at the end of the day what 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.440
 do not 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.120
 interest to all and at least those who 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.010
 we know what they love and their that is not everything 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.810
 the world is to have a device with 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.670
 good specifications at a price 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.410
 reduced and beyond that then there 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.240
 all devices like android 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.650
 they serve which is fine at the end and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.300
 What we want is that we also 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.190
 come at a more content price can 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.200
 be so here's the video today 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.230
 I hope you liked it and if so 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 not well I'll give like an ipad android like that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.300
 what the grÃ cia 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.300
 until next time
