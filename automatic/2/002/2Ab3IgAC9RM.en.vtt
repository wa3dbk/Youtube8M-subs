there just happen to notice one day that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
there just happen to notice one day that
they<00:00:54.090> were<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> tree<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.289> they<00:00:56.070> pushed

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
they were up in a tree and they pushed

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.400 
they were up in a tree and they pushed
that<00:00:56.640> branch<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> way<00:00:57.600> down<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.109> jumped

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that branch all the way down and jumped

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
that branch all the way down and jumped
off<00:00:58.559> onto<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.730> bird<00:00:59.910> feeder<00:01:02.120> immediately

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
off onto the bird feeder immediately

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
off onto the bird feeder immediately
went<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> trimmed<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> branch<00:01:05.240> thinking

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
went and trimmed that branch thinking

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.710 
went and trimmed that branch thinking
that<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.630> finally<00:01:07.049> had<00:01:07.170> solved<00:01:07.530> our<00:01:07.650> problems

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
that we finally had solved our problems

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
that we finally had solved our problems
the<00:01:09.720> squirrel<00:01:10.049> found<00:01:10.320> another<00:01:10.650> tree<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the squirrel found another tree on the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740 
the squirrel found another tree on the
other<00:01:11.369> side<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> bird<00:01:12.030> feeder<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> did

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
other side of the bird feeder and did

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.950 
other side of the bird feeder and did
the<00:01:12.869> same<00:01:13.049> thing<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> tree<00:01:13.830> branch

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
the same thing with the tree branch

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.940 
the same thing with the tree branch
whereupon<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.380> tree<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.950> trimmed<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:18.950> have

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
whereupon that tree got trimmed I have

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.390 
whereupon that tree got trimmed I have
talked<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.369> several<00:01:20.640> people<00:01:20.850> who<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.630> used

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
talked to several people who have used

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
talked to several people who have used
these<00:01:23.450> squirrel-proof<00:01:24.450> birdfeeder<00:01:24.750> x'<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
these squirrel-proof birdfeeder x' that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.050 
these squirrel-proof birdfeeder x' that
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.340> bide<00:01:26.549> feed<00:01:27.150> stores<00:01:27.509> hardware<00:01:27.810> stores

you can bide feed stores hardware stores

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can bide feed stores hardware stores
other<00:01:30.060> places<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.490> they<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.700> said<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
other places and they have said that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480 
other places and they have said that
they<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:34.140> work<00:01:34.350> either<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they don't work either because the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
they don't work either because the
squirrels<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> even<00:01:36.780> though

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
squirrels get on them and even though

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
squirrels get on them and even though
they<00:01:37.200> can't<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.520> shake<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
they can't get in them they shake the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.960 
they can't get in them they shake the
feeders<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.840> spill<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> bird<00:01:40.890> bird<00:01:41.430> feed

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130 

what<00:01:44.970> we've<00:01:45.180> discovered<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> birds

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
what we've discovered is that the birds

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
what we've discovered is that the birds
and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.340> squirrels<00:01:53.390> mingled<00:01:54.390> together<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and the squirrels mingled together and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.609 
and the squirrels mingled together and
get<00:01:55.409> along<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.680> great<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:58.020> squirrels<00:01:58.469> are

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
get along just great the squirrels are

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
get along just great the squirrels are
running<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> sunflowers<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
running it's and sunflowers because the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.590 
running it's and sunflowers because the
Steve<00:02:01.460> planted<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> ground<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> my

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
Steve planted in the ground so my

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
Steve planted in the ground so my
solution<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.530> leave<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.069> alone

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
solution to that is to leave them alone

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.110 
solution to that is to leave them alone
let<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.360> come<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:10.430> because<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.849> food

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
let them come and go because the food

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.580 
let them come and go because the food
that<00:02:12.300> they<00:02:12.450> put<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.930> ground<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that they put on the ground the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.460 
that they put on the ground the
birds<00:02:13.739> still<00:02:14.040> eat<00:02:14.629> there<00:02:15.629> still<00:02:15.900> food<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.379> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
birds still eat there still food in the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.770 
birds still eat there still food in the
feeder<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> birds<00:02:17.250> will<00:02:17.459> get<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
feeder the birds will get that the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.190 
feeder the birds will get that the
squirrels<00:02:19.260> are<00:02:19.410> happy<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.720> sit<00:02:21.989> back

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
squirrels are happy and if you sit back

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.770 
squirrels are happy and if you sit back
and<00:02:22.410> enjoy<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
and enjoy it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.630 
and enjoy it
