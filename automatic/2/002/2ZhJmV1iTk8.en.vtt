00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.780
 good here I am going to present the garden 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:12.519
 vertical with a drip auto system 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.519
 there we have then the drums 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 with water 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.970
 and these have a drip system with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 floor hoses that regulate the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.390
 intensity of the water drop that does not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.260
 he wants me to come out here 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.250
 you can not see there is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.250
 crying 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.710
 you let 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.710
 these pt bottles are joined 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.670
 in this part they have a proportion of 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.060
 sand so you can drain the water and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.970
 this other part with earth 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.700
 then this causes the drop of 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.490
 water will pass one note and the other 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.500
 obviously the lid has a hole 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.500
 and drop the water towards the others 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.140
 today we have parsley and above all I'm 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 trying with these first seeds 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.020
 is from the magical and let's see how 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 result 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.579
 have only the morning and here we 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.030
 the time he made two emails of five or 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.030
 scale 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.050
 feed the water you can take some 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.270
 substrate some vitamin 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.270
 so that it grows stronger 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.050
 here it is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.020
 and then the water droplet reaches 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.490
 the last of the bottles 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.490
 that the last one is missing 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.890
 in this case is that of the left 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.390
 already has the drop that falls from the first 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.640
 of the five of them and is in the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.640
 fifth 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 obviously still believing water towards 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 work base 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.850
 we always have in a department in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.850
 a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 one since it's there without being used 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.830
 we are going to have they were also painted 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 with white enamel 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.100
 so that you can find a little with the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.440
 green color 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.610
 of the plants and vegetables that are going to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.210
 get out of there 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.040
 here are the basil 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.730
 oregano 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.950
 more to cows 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 and in kind of small greenhouse that 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.459
 I did it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.220
 for parsley and another one that she occupies 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.910
 for the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.910
 according to et 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.370
 we have more 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.550
 As you can see, everything can be organized in the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.860
 balcony 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.000
 placing the supports 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.000
 so they do not fall 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.370
 until a bush of watermelon arrive 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.239
 there we also have cherry tomatoes 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.240
 waiting for the solcito and waiting 30 here 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.970
 we have more salva cars 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.340
 and this super 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.260
 the special flowerpot for 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 to walk the balconies 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.990
 departments 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.590
 we leave then our system of 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.260
 drip to the bottom 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.920
 it's super easy to make simple and it 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.990
 occupies the department space 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.060
 and finally the uses 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.300
 now we have greener green our 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.300
 case
