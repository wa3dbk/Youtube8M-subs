and<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.110> definitely<00:01:46.320> something<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> say

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and that's definitely something to say

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
and that's definitely something to say
because<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.460> majority<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.210> screening

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
because the majority of my screening

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
because the majority of my screening
audience<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> saw<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.920> movie<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.430> were

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
audience that I saw this movie with were

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
audience that I saw this movie with were
children<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.780> than<00:01:51.869> likely<00:01:52.079> weren't

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
children that more than likely weren't

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
children that more than likely weren't
even<00:01:52.590> alive<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> 1999<00:01:54.000> when<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> show

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
even alive in 1999 when the show

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
even alive in 1999 when the show
initially<00:01:55.049> started<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> were<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.159> me

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
initially started so if you were like me

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.649 
initially started so if you were like me
and<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.640> thought<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> first<00:01:57.210> three<00:01:57.479> seasons

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and you thought the first three seasons

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
and you thought the first three seasons
of<00:01:57.930> Spongebob<00:01:58.380> were<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> best<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> might

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
of Spongebob were the best and you might

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
of Spongebob were the best and you might
actually<00:01:59.700> find<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.270> enjoyment<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
actually find some enjoyment in this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually find some enjoyment in this
movie<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.439> were<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.740> concerned<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
movie if you were more concerned that it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
movie if you were more concerned that it
was<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.090> sanitized

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
was going to be a little more sanitized

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
was going to be a little more sanitized
like<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.259> first<00:02:04.560> spongebob<00:02:05.100> movie<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
like that first spongebob movie that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.930 
frightening but like I said if you were
more<00:02:17.650> concerned<00:02:18.069> about<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> being<00:02:18.610> more

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940

keeps going to that I don't care about
and<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.050> would<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.590> stay

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
and I would just like it to stay

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.949 
and I would just like it to stay
underwater<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:37.000> liked<00:02:37.239> how<00:02:37.480> there<00:02:37.810> was

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
underwater I really liked how there was

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.750 
underwater I really liked how there was
a<00:02:37.989> lot<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.560> animation<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.280> movie<00:02:39.520> before

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
a lot of animation in the movie before

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.820 
a lot of animation in the movie before
the<00:02:40.120> CGI<00:02:40.510> stuff<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.260> yeah<00:02:41.470> there<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.800> a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
the CGI stuff because yeah there is a

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.979 
the CGI stuff because yeah there is a
CGI<00:02:42.370> sequence<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.570> posters<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
CGI sequence and from the posters and

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.210 
CGI sequence and from the posters and
the<00:02:44.140> trailers<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.739> might<00:02:44.890> lead<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
the trailers it might lead you to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.770 
the trailers it might lead you to
believe<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.610> entire<00:02:45.700> movies<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.450> but

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
believe the entire movies like that but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.630 
believe the entire movies like that but
it's<00:02:46.870> really<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.500> third<00:02:47.860> act<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.489> was

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
it's really just the third act that was

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.979 
it's really just the third act that was
CGI<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.300> then<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.480> goes<00:02:49.630> right<00:02:49.690> back<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
CGI and then it goes right back to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.600 
CGI and then it goes right back to
traditional<00:02:50.530> animation<00:02:50.920> fairly<00:02:51.400> quickly

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
traditional animation fairly quickly

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.729 
traditional animation fairly quickly
there's<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.269> lot<00:02:52.630> more<00:02:52.900> traditional<00:02:53.500> than<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
there's a lot more traditional than you

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.380 
there's a lot more traditional than you
would<00:02:53.890> have<00:02:53.950> expected<00:02:54.430> which<00:02:54.880> was<00:02:55.090> very

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
would have expected which was very

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.880 
would have expected which was very
refreshing<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.019> me<00:02:56.110> because<00:02:56.440> when<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.650> saw<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
refreshing to me because when I saw the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.710 
refreshing to me because when I saw the
previews<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.550> like<00:02:57.640> oh<00:02:57.760> great<00:02:58.180> they're

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
previews I was like oh great they're

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750 
previews I was like oh great they're
just<00:02:58.870> doing<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.500> CGI<00:03:00.010> because<00:03:00.459> apparently

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
just doing more CGI because apparently

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.400 
just doing more CGI because apparently
everything<00:03:01.180> has<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.420> be<00:03:01.510> CGI<00:03:01.900> nowadays

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
everything has to be CGI nowadays

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.720 
everything has to be CGI nowadays
because<00:03:02.620> no<00:03:02.920> kid<00:03:03.160> wants<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.519> watch

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
because no kid wants to watch

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.729 
because no kid wants to watch
traditional<00:03:04.330> animation<00:03:04.720> anymore<00:03:05.290> but

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739
