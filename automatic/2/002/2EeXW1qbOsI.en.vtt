00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello everyone with you again benders and welcome 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.130
 to the first olympiad in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.230
 Minecraft obstacle course 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 throwing like me yes and min so the thing is 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.139
 what is the current mod that we put 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 Roasted our minkvravt adds on pen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.810
 running track flat obstacles in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.720
 third spear and fourth fuck anyone 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.240
 don't need a radar but let's start with radar 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 the radar is very strange I do not know why it 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.309
 generally entered but it shows what the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 behind you that is here with us 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.120
 the cow is turning around and if you 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.260
 look there green dots 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.140
 these cows are marked 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.329
 he is absolutely not needed here so if 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 Of course, this fashion designer is unlikely 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 This will look my videos then take away the radar 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 infection 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 here and now move on to more 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.699
 The interesting part of this mod is this treadmill 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.610
 track well firstly this is such a block 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 and which symbolizes the race themselves 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.280
 tracks 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 can be done somehow so here you can 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 make a long treadmill and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.850
 so on if this mod is put on 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 the server is very cool and it will be possible 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.760
 arrange your run now 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 to have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.890
 and the obstacle is such a very hk which 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.170
 if we don't jump it will fall and we 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 we can deploy it to any place for 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 this need to poke on about fallen on it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.830
 and why you see, you can deploy it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.110
 but I don't know why this is necessary because 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.330
 usually you can all in one direction 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.700
 put and run okay let's go to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.530
 running myself with 3 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.150
 banzai banzai is stupid this is cool guys on 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.049
 really difficult to jump them i 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.909
 just jumped all see them 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.770
 yes now it was less successful 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.250
 mod principle is very funny because 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.479
 if you put it on the server you can 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.070
 arrange races especially if 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.689
 less advanced server who's there 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.250
 you can arrange races and hand out 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.680
 cookies or diamond 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.810
