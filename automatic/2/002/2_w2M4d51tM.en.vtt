actually treating the symptoms and the
symptoms<00:01:31.429> again<00:01:31.849> are<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.119> blades<00:01:32.390> releasing

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
symptoms again are the blades releasing

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.469 
symptoms again are the blades releasing
from<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.649> stolen<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.489> if<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.030> happens

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
from that stolen and if that happens

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.719 
from that stolen and if that happens
continually<00:01:36.110> from<00:01:36.319> year<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.649> year<00:01:36.679> what<00:01:37.610> will

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
continually from year to year what will

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.490 
continually from year to year what will
happen<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.179> that<00:01:38.209> the<00:01:38.539> grass<00:01:38.780> will<00:01:39.050> weaken<00:01:39.380> and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
happen is that the grass will weaken and

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.809 
happen is that the grass will weaken and
eventually<00:01:39.979> you'll<00:01:40.160> end<00:01:40.340> up<00:01:40.429> with<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.640> dead

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
eventually you'll end up with a dead

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.400 
eventually you'll end up with a dead
spot<00:01:41.119> in<00:01:41.239> the<00:01:41.300> lawn<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:41.959> important<00:01:42.380> to

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
spot in the lawn so it's important to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.430 
spot in the lawn so it's important to
get<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.739> treated<00:01:43.300> proper<00:01:44.300> treating<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.989> time

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
get that treated proper treating is time

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.499 
get that treated proper treating is time
sensitive<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.190> really<00:01:47.060> when<00:01:47.179> you<00:01:47.270> want<00:01:47.420> to

treat in the southern United States and

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.290 
treat in the southern United States and
we<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:51.410> happen<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.679> be<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:51.860> Central<00:01:52.340> Texas<00:01:52.369> is

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
we just happen to be in Central Texas is

first two treatments are generally

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.690 
first two treatments are generally
necessary<00:02:00.229> something<00:02:00.979> around<00:02:01.160> September

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
necessary something around September

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.369 
necessary something around September
first<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.209> then<00:02:02.300> again<00:02:02.660> at<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.869> first<00:02:03.200> of

October and again when you when you

treat preventive ly it takes less

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.110 
treat preventive ly it takes less
product<00:02:08.780> less<00:02:09.500> toxic<00:02:10.190> products<00:02:10.729> safer

product less toxic products safer

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.880 
product less toxic products safer
products<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.810> use<00:02:12.020> less<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.590> them

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
products and you use less of them

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.710

because<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:13.819> like<00:02:13.970> with<00:02:14.150> people<00:02:14.209> it's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
because just like with people it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.390

stays healthy so recovery in the
springtime<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.390> actually<00:03:00.720> pretty<00:03:00.960> quick<00:03:01.170> but

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
springtime is actually pretty quick but

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
year a little bit more until it finally

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.490 
year a little bit more until it finally
dies<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:09.000> reason<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
dies and the reason for that is that the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
dies and the reason for that is that the
blades<00:03:10.800> actually<00:03:11.100> produced<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
blades actually produced the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.860 
blades actually produced the
carbohydrates<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.140> feed<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.620> plant<00:03:13.950> so

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
carbohydrates that feed the plant so

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.060 
carbohydrates that feed the plant so
even<00:03:15.870> though<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.110> plant<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.560> actually<00:03:16.860> store

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
even though the plant can actually store

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.400 
even though the plant can actually store
some<00:03:17.430> carbohydrates<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:18.990> stored

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
some carbohydrates that stored

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.280 
some carbohydrates that stored
carbohydrate<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.000> uses<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.570> regrow

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
carbohydrate is what it uses to regrow

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.700 
carbohydrate is what it uses to regrow
the<00:03:23.130> leaves<00:03:23.400> or<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.760> blades<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.840> grass<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.200> so

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
the leaves or the blades of grass and so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.770 
the leaves or the blades of grass and so
if<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.920> got<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.430> from<00:03:26.610> every<00:03:27.120> every

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.680 
if it's got to do that from every every
year<00:03:28.250> eventually<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.550> thin<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
year eventually it's going to thin the

severity of brown patch can be reduced

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.330 
severity of brown patch can be reduced
by<00:03:33.030> changing<00:03:33.960> some<00:03:33.990> cultural<00:03:34.650> practices

by changing some cultural practices
during<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.360> year<00:03:36.600> most<00:03:36.960> people<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.470> mowed

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
one height in other words they'll set

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.450

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
midsummer and that's what they do you

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.400 
midsummer and that's what they do you
know<00:03:50.220> really<00:03:50.700> most<00:03:51.360> different<00:03:51.840> most<00:03:52.020> diseases

your lawn which is what we're talking

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.600 
your lawn which is what we're talking
about<00:03:57.810> now<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.500> reduce<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.070> severity<00:03:59.460> of

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
about now you can reduce the severity of

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.270 
about now you can reduce the severity of
it<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.060> by<00:04:00.270> changing<00:04:00.540> those<00:04:01.530> cultural

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
it just by changing those cultural

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.190 
it just by changing those cultural
practice<00:04:02.760> practices<00:04:03.360> watering<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:03.930> milling

practice practices watering and milling

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.930 
practice practices watering and milling
and<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.800> mean<00:04:05.070> by<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.460> is<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.760> need<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
and what I mean by that is you need to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.450 
and what I mean by that is you need to
increase<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.450> air<00:04:06.840> circulation<00:04:07.500> if<00:04:07.890> you've

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
increase the air circulation if you've

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.160 
increase the air circulation if you've
done<00:04:08.670> any<00:04:08.820> rose<00:04:09.030> gardening<00:04:09.510> or<00:04:09.630> any<00:04:09.750> gardening

at all with different types of

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.580 
at all with different types of
ornamentals<00:04:12.240> you<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.320> if<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
ornamentals you know that if you the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.520 
ornamentals you know that if you the
trick<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.670> limiting<00:04:15.360> disease<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.960> them<00:04:16.170> is<00:04:16.290> to

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
trick to limiting disease on them is to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.229 
trick to limiting disease on them is to
increase<00:04:16.830> air<00:04:17.070> circulation<00:04:17.640> well<00:04:17.940> how<00:04:18.060> do<00:04:18.120> you

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
increase air circulation well how do you

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.479 
increase air circulation well how do you
do<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.720> turf<00:04:19.170> grass<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:20.280> mow<00:04:20.460> a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
do that on turf grass you just mow a

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.520 
do that on turf grass you just mow a
little<00:04:20.790> bit<00:04:20.910> lower

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530

that will do is it will increase the

grass the other thing that you want to
do<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.710> be<00:04:37.980> careful<00:04:38.370> about<00:04:39.150> when<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.960> do

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
do is be careful about when you do

do is be careful about when you do
irrigate<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:40.950> be<00:04:41.100> careful<00:04:41.580> in

irrigate and be careful in
so<00:04:41.939> that<00:04:42.119> you<00:04:42.209> don't<00:04:42.419> over<00:04:42.839> irrigate<00:04:43.319> that

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
so that you don't over irrigate that

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.570 
so that you don't over irrigate that
September<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:44.879> first<00:04:45.499> time<00:04:46.499> our<00:04:47.129> point<00:04:47.459> in

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
September the first time our point in

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.029 
September the first time our point in
time<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:48.179> really<00:04:48.929> when<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.169> day<00:04:49.349> start<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.889> get

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
time is really when the day start to get

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.939 
time is really when the day start to get
shorter<00:04:50.069> very<00:04:50.789> very<00:04:51.029> very<00:04:51.300> quickly<00:04:51.659> so<00:04:52.199> one

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
shorter very very very quickly so one

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.529 
shorter very very very quickly so one
thing<00:04:53.159> that<00:04:53.189> you<00:04:53.369> don't<00:04:53.550> ever<00:04:53.879> want<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.389> do

is water at night okay

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.439 
is water at night okay
if<00:04:57.869> you<00:04:57.990> water<00:04:58.229> at<00:04:58.439> night<00:04:58.469> in<00:04:59.129> the<00:05:00.029> spring<00:05:00.330> of

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
if you water at night in the spring of

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.850 
if you water at night in the spring of
the<00:05:00.539> fall<00:05:00.719> you<00:05:00.959> will<00:05:01.080> definitely<00:05:01.319> get<00:05:01.589> brown

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
the fall you will definitely get brown

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.829 
the fall you will definitely get brown
patching<00:05:02.309> and<00:05:02.429> you<00:05:02.669> know<00:05:02.789> that's<00:05:03.449> just<00:05:03.539> the

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:03.839 
patching and you know that's just the

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.510 
patching and you know that's just the
way<00:05:03.929> it<00:05:03.990> is<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.319> the<00:05:04.379> reason<00:05:04.409> for<00:05:04.919> that<00:05:05.039> is<00:05:05.279> is

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
way it is and the reason for that is is

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.029 
way it is and the reason for that is is
for<00:05:05.759> brown<00:05:06.419> patch<00:05:06.749> to<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.259> healthy<00:05:07.709> and<00:05:07.830> what

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
for brown patch to be healthy and what

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.029 
for brown patch to be healthy and what

four hours so if you water during the
daytime<00:05:18.629> as<00:05:18.809> soon<00:05:18.929> as<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.139> irrigate<00:05:19.529> that

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:19.559 
daytime as soon as you irrigate that

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.519 
daytime as soon as you irrigate that
lawn<00:05:19.949> or<00:05:20.669> whatever<00:05:21.089> planet<00:05:21.509> is<00:05:21.659> the<00:05:21.869> gravity

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
lawn or whatever planet is the gravity

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:23.749 
lawn or whatever planet is the gravity
is<00:05:22.589> going<00:05:22.679> to<00:05:22.740> start<00:05:22.979> pulling<00:05:23.189> that<00:05:23.399> moisture

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
is going to start pulling that moisture

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.249 
is going to start pulling that moisture
straight<00:05:24.029> down<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.419> evaporation<00:05:24.899> is<00:05:25.139> going

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
straight down and evaporation is going

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.109 
straight down and evaporation is going
to<00:05:25.319> happen<00:05:25.649> and<00:05:25.769> pull<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.069> water<00:05:26.219> upward<00:05:26.699> and

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:27.119 
to happen and pull the water upward and

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:28.759 
to happen and pull the water upward and
so<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.389> moisture<00:05:27.719> just<00:05:27.749> doesn't<00:05:28.259> stay<00:05:28.469> there

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:28.769 
so the moisture just doesn't stay there

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.639 
so the moisture just doesn't stay there
if<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:29.399> water<00:05:29.639> at<00:05:29.849> night<00:05:30.289> you<00:05:31.289> know<00:05:31.379> before

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:31.649 
if you water at night you know before

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:32.959 
if you water at night you know before
you<00:05:31.709> go<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.860> bed<00:05:32.039> or<00:05:32.129> whatever<00:05:32.279> what's<00:05:32.699> going

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
you go to bed or whatever what's going

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.429 
you go to bed or whatever what's going
to<00:05:32.999> happen<00:05:33.449> is<00:05:33.569> that<00:05:33.599> moisture<00:05:34.169> is<00:05:34.259> going<00:05:34.349> to

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
to happen is that moisture is going to

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.999 
to happen is that moisture is going to
sit<00:05:35.249> on<00:05:35.279> the<00:05:35.550> on<00:05:36.179> the<00:05:36.419> stolen<00:05:37.009> gravitational

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
sit on the on the stolen gravitational

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.379 
sit on the on the stolen gravitational
pull<00:05:38.159> will<00:05:38.339> pull<00:05:38.519> it<00:05:38.639> down<00:05:38.819> but<00:05:39.029> it<00:05:39.119> takes<00:05:39.300> a

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
pull will pull it down but it takes a

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.179 
pull will pull it down but it takes a
little<00:05:39.509> lot<00:05:39.779> longer<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.439> that<00:05:40.589> that<00:05:40.949> four

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
little lot longer and that that four

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.759 
little lot longer and that that four
hour<00:05:41.339> window<00:05:41.610> will<00:05:42.059> most<00:05:42.629> often<00:05:42.899> be<00:05:43.110> exceeded

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:43.769 
hour window will most often be exceeded

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:46.189 
hour window will most often be exceeded
so<00:05:44.009> it<00:05:44.249> makes<00:05:44.459> it<00:05:44.639> makes<00:05:44.879> the<00:05:45.059> turfgrass<00:05:45.269> way

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
so it makes it makes the turfgrass way

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.269 
so it makes it makes the turfgrass way
more<00:05:46.439> susceptible<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:47.869> the<00:05:48.869> brown<00:05:49.110> patch<00:05:49.379> when

more susceptible to the brown patch when

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.100 
more susceptible to the brown patch when
diagnosing<00:05:50.909> brown<00:05:51.119> patch<00:05:51.360> it's<00:05:51.599> important<00:05:52.050> to

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
diagnosing brown patch it's important to

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.219 
diagnosing brown patch it's important to
note<00:05:52.319> the<00:05:52.589> shape<00:05:52.919> of<00:05:53.189> the<00:05:53.339> affected<00:05:53.849> area

note the shape of the affected area

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.709 
note the shape of the affected area
Brown<00:05:55.229> patch<00:05:55.529> sometimes<00:05:56.219> will<00:05:57.209> form<00:05:57.479> into<00:05:57.629> a

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
Brown patch sometimes will form into a

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.509 
Brown patch sometimes will form into a
circular<00:05:58.229> pattern<00:05:58.439> the<00:05:58.769> reason<00:05:59.159> is<00:05:59.309> it's

00:05:59.509 --> 00:05:59.519 
circular pattern the reason is it's

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.439 
circular pattern the reason is it's
going<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.669> start<00:05:59.909> from<00:06:00.059> the<00:06:00.180> point<00:06:00.389> of

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
going to start from the point of

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:01.939 
going to start from the point of
infection<00:06:00.779> and<00:06:01.110> spread<00:06:01.439> out<00:06:01.589> in<00:06:01.769> all

be in a circle or an irregular circle

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.139 
be in a circle or an irregular circle
sometimes<00:06:07.379> it<00:06:08.009> will<00:06:08.099> start<00:06:08.369> to<00:06:08.459> recover<00:06:08.849> back

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
sometimes it will start to recover back

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.850 
sometimes it will start to recover back
in<00:06:09.329> the<00:06:09.449> center<00:06:09.689> and<00:06:10.079> you'll<00:06:10.229> actually<00:06:10.439> end<00:06:10.619> up
