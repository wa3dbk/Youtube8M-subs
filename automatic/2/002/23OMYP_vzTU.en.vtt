I feel like George Lucas got the idea
for<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.540> movie<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.140> same<00:02:36.349> way<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.650> James

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
for this movie the same way that James

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920 
for this movie the same way that James
Cameron<00:02:37.220> did<00:02:37.549> for<00:02:37.730> avatar<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.599> that's<00:02:38.750> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
Cameron did for avatar and that's that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
Cameron did for avatar and that's that
they<00:02:39.049> saw<00:02:39.260> someone<00:02:39.650> else's<00:02:40.010> movie<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.459> said

from I think maybe a year or two ago I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.770 
from I think maybe a year or two ago I
would<00:02:55.069> totally<00:02:55.459> believe<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.850> which<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I think her design is really awesome

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.120 
I think her design is really awesome
like<00:03:05.420> her<00:03:05.600> purple<00:03:06.019> wings<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.590> moonlight<00:03:06.950> I

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
this derivative film that I'm probably

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.949 
this derivative film that I'm probably
gonna<00:03:13.940> have<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.120> sit<00:03:14.359> there<00:03:14.510> because<00:03:14.630> it's

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
gonna have to sit there because it's

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:15.849 
gonna have to sit there because it's
from<00:03:15.139> Lucasfilm

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
from Lucasfilm

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.940 
from Lucasfilm
and<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.299> how<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.720> pass<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.230> up<00:03:18.290> so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
and you know how can you pass that up so

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.289 
and you know how can you pass that up so
that's<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.310> really<00:03:19.489> disappointing<00:03:20.120> and

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
that's just really disappointing and

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.490 
that's just really disappointing and
there's<00:03:20.420> some<00:03:20.569> really<00:03:20.660> cool<00:03:20.870> elements<00:03:21.350> here

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
there's some really cool elements here

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.990 
there's some really cool elements here
also<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.859> know<00:03:22.010> what<00:03:22.130> else<00:03:22.280> seems<00:03:22.489> cool<00:03:22.790> I

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
also you know what else seems cool I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.789 
also you know what else seems cool I
think<00:03:23.690> she's<00:03:23.870> gonna<00:03:24.019> fall<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.470> love<00:03:24.620> with<00:03:24.769> that

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
think she's gonna fall in love with that

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.530 
think she's gonna fall in love with that
tree<00:03:25.280> bark<00:03:25.549> bad<00:03:25.819> guy

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
tree bark bad guy

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.559 
tree bark bad guy
I<00:03:26.569> believe<00:03:27.139> that's<00:03:27.260> Alan<00:03:27.650> Cummings<00:03:28.040> voice<00:03:28.569> so

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
I believe that's Alan Cummings voice so

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.420 
I believe that's Alan Cummings voice so
he<00:03:29.780> could<00:03:29.930> potentially<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.680> voicing<00:03:31.130> our<00:03:31.280> are

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
he could potentially be voicing our are

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.729 
he could potentially be voicing our are
both<00:03:32.120> our<00:03:32.269> villain<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.750> our<00:03:32.840> romantic<00:03:33.350> lead

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
both our villain and our romantic lead

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.740 
both our villain and our romantic lead
right<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.609> would<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.819> a<00:03:34.850> cool<00:03:35.150> twist<00:03:35.359> and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
right that would be a cool twist and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.599 
right that would be a cool twist and
again<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.620> weird<00:03:36.889> to<00:03:36.950> have<00:03:37.160> these<00:03:37.310> unique

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
again it's so weird to have these unique

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.120 
again it's so weird to have these unique
elements<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.389> a<00:03:38.989> highly<00:03:39.380> derivative<00:03:39.920> and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
elements in a highly derivative and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.360 
elements in a highly derivative and
simplistic<00:03:41.139> story<00:03:42.139> although<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.130> mean

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
simplistic story although I mean

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.559 
simplistic story although I mean
sometimes<00:03:43.549> it<00:03:43.850> works<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:44.209> worked<00:03:44.359> very<00:03:44.420> well

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
sometimes it works it worked very well

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.470 
sometimes it works it worked very well
for<00:03:44.720> frozen<00:03:45.380> but<00:03:46.100> again<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.519> know<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.819> music

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
for frozen but again you know the music

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.080 
for frozen but again you know the music
is<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.630> very<00:03:47.720> big<00:03:48.079> part<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.709> success<00:03:49.489> story

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
is a very big part of that success story

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.759 
is a very big part of that success story
and<00:03:50.540> also<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.079> know<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.290> Disney<00:03:51.590> brand

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
and also that you know the Disney brand

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.680 
and also that you know the Disney brand
for<00:03:52.010> princesses<00:03:52.609> Lucasfilm<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.299> coming<00:03:53.569> off

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
for princesses Lucasfilm is coming off

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.930 
for princesses Lucasfilm is coming off
of<00:03:53.720> nothing<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.560> again<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.340> know<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.790> not

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
of nothing and again you know it's not

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.390 
of nothing and again you know it's not
derivative<00:03:56.569> of<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.099> just<00:03:58.250> a

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
derivative of like you know just a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.729 
derivative of like you know just a
generic<00:03:58.579> idea<00:03:59.239> it's<00:03:59.690> actually<00:04:00.290> copying

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
generic idea it's actually copying

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.469 
generic idea it's actually copying
movies<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.220> exists<00:04:01.729> and<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.150> hard<00:04:02.329> to

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
movies that exists and so it's hard to

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.540 
movies that exists and so it's hard to
watch<00:04:02.600> this<00:04:02.900> one<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.199> not<00:04:03.530> think<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:04.009> those

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
watch this one and not think of those

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.550 
watch this one and not think of those
again<00:04:05.150> epic<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.690> Fern<00:04:05.870> Gully<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.350> again<00:04:06.530> a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
again epic and Fern Gully and again a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.200 
again epic and Fern Gully and again a
little<00:04:06.800> bit<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.070> Tinkerbell<00:04:07.580> but<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:07.820> do<00:04:07.910> like

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
little bit of Tinkerbell but I do like

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.090 
little bit of Tinkerbell but I do like
the<00:04:08.330> character<00:04:08.660> design<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.650> I

the character design so I like that I

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.920 
the character design so I like that I
like<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.310> purple<00:04:10.610> ways<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.240> like<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.600> idea<00:04:11.870> of

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
like the purple ways I like the idea of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.530 
like the purple ways I like the idea of
our<00:04:12.350> heroine<00:04:13.070> falling<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.790> love<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.330> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
particularly the faces they're so clear

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.290 
particularly the faces they're so clear
and<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.980> can<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.280> see<00:04:22.400> everything<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.000> well

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
I think the company like not only they

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.890 
I think the company like not only they
want<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.460> protect<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.880> brand<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.780> know

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
Star Wars Lucas fell on Industrial Light

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.790 
Star Wars Lucas fell on Industrial Light

magic but George Lucas is something of a
brand<00:05:22.040> now<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:22.850> think<00:05:23.030> they<00:05:23.090> need<00:05:23.210> to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270

protect<00:05:23.510> him<00:05:23.780> from<00:05:23.840> himself<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.010> he<00:05:25.160> goes

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
protect him from himself so that he goes

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.120 
protect him from himself so that he goes
down<00:05:25.730> more<00:05:25.910> like<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.180> Walt<00:05:26.390> Disney<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:28.010> know

down more like a Walt Disney you know

down more like a Walt Disney you know
then<00:05:28.370> you<00:05:28.730> know<00:05:28.760> just<00:05:28.880> someone<00:05:29.330> who<00:05:29.450> had<00:05:29.570> a

then you know just someone who had a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.990 
then you know just someone who had a

enough that there are others around to

goes around saying George you can write
this<00:05:41.450> stuff<00:05:41.690> but<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.110> can't<00:05:42.350> say<00:05:42.710> it<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.400> let's

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
this stuff but you can't say it so let's

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.100 
this stuff but you can't say it so let's
say<00:05:43.700> if<00:05:43.790> that<00:05:43.910> same<00:05:44.090> problem<00:05:44.480> continues<00:05:44.780> with

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
say if that same problem continues with

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.320 
say if that same problem continues with
this<00:05:45.290> film<00:05:45.590> but<00:05:45.860> again<00:05:46.190> some<00:05:46.790> really<00:05:47.060> stellar

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
this won't be too much of it done and

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.409 
this won't be too much of it done and
