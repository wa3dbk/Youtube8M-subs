know why the PC version got released but

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.180 
know why the PC version got released but
the<00:02:35.970> Xbox<00:02:36.360> 360<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.200> ps3<00:02:37.350> versions<00:02:38.010> did

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190

the Xbox 360 and the ps3 versions did
not<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.550> released<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> PC<00:02:39.720> version<00:02:40.050> I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
not get released but the PC version I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.199 
not get released but the PC version I
heard<00:02:40.380> was<00:02:40.590> not<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.130> good<00:02:41.340> anyways<00:02:41.760> so

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
heard was not that good anyways so

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.699 
heard was not that good anyways so
that's<00:02:42.510> probably<00:02:42.840> why<00:02:43.110> they<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
that's probably why they don't want to

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.309 
that's probably why they don't want to
release<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.190> console<00:02:45.180> game<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.110> it
