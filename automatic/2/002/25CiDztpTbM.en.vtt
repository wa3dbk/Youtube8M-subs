00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
to leave a bit of a gap or like the ink

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.609 
to leave a bit of a gap or like the ink
doesn't<00:01:25.299> fully<00:01:25.630> run<00:01:25.899> out<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:26.259> sometimes<00:01:26.560> i

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
doesn't fully run out so sometimes i

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.929 
doesn't fully run out so sometimes i
just<00:01:26.649> kind<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:26.950> go<00:01:27.039> back<00:01:27.249> and<00:01:27.279> forth<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
just kind of go back and forth on the

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.449 
just kind of go back and forth on the
same<00:01:28.179> area<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.350> i<00:01:29.439> find<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.009> solves

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
same area and i find that that solves

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:37.050 
same area and i find that that solves
the<00:01:30.579> problem<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.459> you<00:01:33.579> go<00:01:33.729> slow<00:01:35.849> maybe<00:01:36.849> the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the problem and if you go slow maybe the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.139 
the problem and if you go slow maybe the
ink<00:01:37.090> will<00:01:37.450> just<00:01:37.659> kind<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.929> come<00:01:38.170> out<00:01:38.999> there<00:01:39.999> we

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
ink will just kind of come out there we

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.129 
ink will just kind of come out there we
go<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.159> this<00:01:42.310> would<00:01:42.429> be<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.609> really<00:01:43.079> quick<00:01:44.079> way

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
go so this would be a really quick way

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:47.039 
go so this would be a really quick way
to<00:01:44.770> make<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.789> series<00:01:46.179> of<00:01:46.299> gingerbread<00:01:46.659> matter

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
to make a series of gingerbread matter

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.010
