00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
third period as interesting as that one

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.370 
third period as interesting as that one
was<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.940> ad<00:01:34.030> for<00:01:34.210> sure<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.570> wild<00:01:34.870> one<00:01:35.020> we

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
throw everything on that and hopefully

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.370 
throw everything on that and hopefully
we<00:01:51.520> get<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.670> good<00:01:51.850> balance<00:01:52.000> an<00:01:52.330> m1<00:01:52.720> goes<00:01:52.870> in<00:01:53.110> but

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
we get a good balance an m1 goes in but

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.280 
we get a good balance an m1 goes in but
unfortunately<00:01:54.220> we<00:01:55.210> didn't<00:01:55.420> get<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.720> like

recruiting

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.959 
recruiting
for<00:04:51.599> short<00:04:51.809> the<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.650> Wildcats<00:04:53.099> they<00:04:53.729> really

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
for short the the Wildcats they really

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.329 
for short the the Wildcats they really
want<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.330> generate<00:04:54.719> some<00:04:54.900> momentum<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.620> really

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:56.339 
want to generate some momentum I really

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.739 
want to generate some momentum I really
think<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.789> started<00:04:57.150> off<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.509> third

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
think that it started off in the third

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.989 
think that it started off in the third
period<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.860> 93<00:04:59.309> blow<00:04:59.490> out<00:04:59.639> where<00:04:59.669> they

00:04:59.989 --> 00:04:59.999 
period of the the 93 blow out where they

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.360 
period of the the 93 blow out where they
just<00:05:00.210> sort<00:05:00.449> of<00:05:00.539> laid<00:05:01.289> back<00:05:01.319> you<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.099> talked

just sort of laid back you and I talked
about<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.819> that<00:05:03.059> you<00:05:03.870> know<00:05:03.960> there<00:05:04.080> wasn't<00:05:04.229> a

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
about it that you know there wasn't a

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.049 
about it that you know there wasn't a
lot<00:05:04.499> of<00:05:04.650> intensity<00:05:05.099> in<00:05:05.279> that<00:05:05.400> third<00:05:05.610> period

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:06.059

look forward to a game or well the great
thing<00:05:23.999> is<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.389> think<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:24.839> Wildcats<00:05:25.229> regain<00:05:25.529> the

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:25.649 
thing is I think the Wildcats regain the

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.589 
thing is I think the Wildcats regain the
momentum<00:05:25.740> off<00:05:26.249> of<00:05:26.490> that<00:05:26.550> third<00:05:26.789> period<00:05:27.210> they

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
momentum off of that third period they

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.510 
momentum off of that third period they
did<00:05:27.809> lose<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.229> game<00:05:28.409> however<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:29.309> doesn't

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
have doesn't hurt them the fact that

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.540 
have doesn't hurt them the fact that
they<00:05:31.499> they<00:05:31.860> still<00:05:32.039> have<00:05:32.219> home-ice<00:05:32.520> advantage
