00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
yo Eliot I've got a question from our

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.700 
yo Eliot I've got a question from our
buddy<00:00:11.730> Stephen<00:00:12.240> he's<00:00:12.690> doing<00:00:13.170> incline<00:00:13.530> bench

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
buddy Stephen he's doing incline bench

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.980 
buddy Stephen he's doing incline bench
presses<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.519> he's<00:00:14.790> finding<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.420> he<00:00:15.719> only

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
presses and he's finding that he only

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.870 
presses and he's finding that he only
feels<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> his<00:00:16.529> shoulders<00:00:16.949> he<00:00:17.490> doesn't

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
feels it in his shoulders he doesn't

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820 
feels it in his shoulders he doesn't
feel<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.359> his<00:00:18.510> chest<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:18.990> shoulders<00:00:19.470> are

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
feel it in his chest so shoulders are

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.080 
feel it in his chest so shoulders are
getting<00:00:19.949> real<00:00:20.250> sore<00:00:20.550> they're<00:00:20.880> getting

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
getting real sore they're getting

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
getting real sore they're getting
activated<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.170> he<00:00:22.260> can't<00:00:22.560> seem<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> get<00:00:23.100> his

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
activated but he can't seem to get his

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.970 
activated but he can't seem to get his
chest<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.869> activated<00:00:25.350> he<00:00:25.590> doesn't<00:00:25.859> feel

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
chest to be activated he doesn't feel

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.140 
chest to be activated he doesn't feel
anything<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> his<00:00:26.490> chest<00:00:26.730> he's<00:00:26.849> wondering

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
anything in his chest he's wondering

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
anything in his chest he's wondering
what<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> hell<00:00:27.539> he<00:00:27.630> should<00:00:27.810> go<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.320> was

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
what the hell he should go on it was

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
what the hell he should go on it was
going<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:29.580> could<00:00:29.880> he<00:00:30.000> activate<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.019> chest

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
going on how could he activate the chest

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.870 
going on how could he activate the chest
muscles<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.250> advice<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.669> going<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
muscles so the advice that I'm going to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630 
muscles so the advice that I'm going to
give<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.050> used<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.739> regard<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> any

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
give you can be used with regard to any

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
give you can be used with regard to any
reciprocal<00:00:36.630> inhibition<00:00:36.980> right<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
reciprocal inhibition right and that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.220 
reciprocal inhibition right and that
term<00:00:38.730> reciprocal<00:00:39.329> inhibition<00:00:39.510> basically

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
term reciprocal inhibition basically

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.930 
term reciprocal inhibition basically
means<00:00:40.469> where<00:00:40.920> you've<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.430> muscles<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
means where you've got two muscles that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.750 
means where you've got two muscles that
should<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.300> working<00:00:42.570> together<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.370> one

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
should be working together right but one

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
should be working together right but one
of<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:45.180> has<00:00:45.570> decided<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.379> nervous<00:00:46.620> system

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
of them has decided the nervous system

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.090 
of them has decided the nervous system
has<00:00:46.890> decided<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.460> more<00:00:47.700> important<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
has decided is more important right and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
has decided is more important right and
stimulates<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> absence<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> another

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
stimulates it to the absence of another

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
stimulates it to the absence of another
muscle<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> mean<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.410> happens<00:00:52.680> all<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.309> our

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
muscle I mean this happens all over our

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
muscle I mean this happens all over our
bodies<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> shoulders<00:00:54.980> release<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
bodies and the shoulders release to the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
bodies and the shoulders release to the
front<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.090> happens<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.449> our<00:00:57.570> hips<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
front and back it happens in our hips it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
front and back it happens in our hips it
happens<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.500> over<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:59.190> basically<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.730> get

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
happens all over or basically you get

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.830 
happens all over or basically you get
these<00:01:00.030> muscles<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.510> become<00:01:00.809> very

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
these muscles that become very

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.100 
these muscles that become very
hypertonic<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.600> disallow<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> nervous

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
hypertonic and they disallow the nervous

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
hypertonic and they disallow the nervous
system<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> drive<00:01:04.830> energy<00:01:05.299> into<00:01:06.299> another

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
system to drive energy into another

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
system to drive energy into another
muscle<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:07.650> associated<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
muscle that's associated with the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100 
muscle that's associated with the
movement<00:01:08.400> hence<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> term<00:01:09.270> reciprocal

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
movement hence the term reciprocal

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
movement hence the term reciprocal
inhibition<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.820> working<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
inhibition right one is over working in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
inhibition right one is over working in
relation<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.920> you've<00:01:14.070> got

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
relation to the other so what you've got

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
relation to the other so what you've got
to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.600> just<00:01:15.600> specifically<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
to do just specifically for you but

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.200 
to do just specifically for you but
anybody<00:01:17.070> who's<00:01:17.369> experiencing<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.000> type<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
anybody who's experiencing this type of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
anybody who's experiencing this type of
problem<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> situation

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
problem you know you get the situation

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
problem you know you get the situation
where<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> biceps<00:01:21.000> work<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> time<00:01:21.810> when

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
where the biceps work all the time when

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.179 
where the biceps work all the time when
you're<00:01:22.110> doing<00:01:22.320> rows<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> can't<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you're doing rows and you can't get the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
you're doing rows and you can't get the
back<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> work<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> got<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.869> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
back to work what you got to do is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
back to work what you got to do is
you've<00:01:25.140> got<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> stretch<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.400> muscle<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you've got to stretch the muscle that is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
you've got to stretch the muscle that is
very<00:01:28.020> hyperactive<00:01:28.860> before<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.090> your

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
very hyperactive before you go into your

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.429 
very hyperactive before you go into your
exercise<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.200> trying<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
exercise so if you're trying to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
exercise so if you're trying to
stimulate<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> chest<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.640> chest

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
stimulate the chest you want your chest

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.630 
stimulate the chest you want your chest
muscles<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> pump<00:01:34.079> right<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
muscles to get more of a pump right and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.359 
muscles to get more of a pump right and
and<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.670> feel<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> shoulders<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.720> over

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
and you feel the shoulders are over

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
and you feel the shoulders are over
acting<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.850> want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> stretch<00:01:39.509> those<00:01:39.750> muscles

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
acting you want to stretch those muscles

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.889 
acting you want to stretch those muscles
in<00:01:40.320> particular<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.369> PEC<00:01:41.610> minor<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.329> PEC

in particular so the PEC minor a PEC

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.200 
in particular so the PEC minor a PEC
minor<00:01:43.079> stretch<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.770> even<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.759> stretch<00:01:45.030> where

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
minor stretch and even a stretch where

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.340

parts to any great degree what I try to
do<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.030> rehab<00:02:25.030> patterns<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> push<00:02:26.200> pattern

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
do is rehab patterns and a push pattern

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.340 
do is rehab patterns and a push pattern
in<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:27.480> eliminates<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.600> chest<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.290> a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
in that eliminates the chest is not a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.800 
in that eliminates the chest is not a
healthy<00:02:29.770> push<00:02:29.980> pattern<00:02:30.190> right<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.300> what<00:02:31.720> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
healthy push pattern right so what you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.970 
healthy push pattern right so what you
want<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> be<00:02:32.050> able<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.530> stimulate<00:02:32.710> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
want to be able to do is stimulate the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.280 
want to be able to do is stimulate the
chest<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.370> think<00:02:33.400> if<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.300> flies<00:02:34.600> with<00:02:34.990> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
chest and I think if you do flies with a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.410 
chest and I think if you do flies with a
sort<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.190> supinated<00:02:36.490> grip<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.090> your<00:02:37.210> palms

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
sort of a supinated grip but your palms

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.480 
sort of a supinated grip but your palms
up<00:02:37.690> somewhat<00:02:38.170> you're<00:02:39.100> going<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
up somewhat you're going to get the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.970 
up somewhat you're going to get the
chest<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.820> work<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.240> lot<00:02:40.810> more<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.230> absence<00:02:41.800> of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
chest to work a lot more in absence of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.250 
chest to work a lot more in absence of
the<00:02:42.610> supporting<00:02:43.270> muscles<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> absence<00:02:44.170> of

muscle and you're using a specific

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.060 
muscle and you're using a specific
isolation<00:02:57.660> exercise<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:59.020> stimulate<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.830> one

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
that doesn't want to work so this is a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.070 
that doesn't want to work so this is a
therapeutic<00:03:02.470> approach<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:03.190> bodybuilding

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
therapeutic approach to bodybuilding

therapeutic approach to bodybuilding
after<00:03:05.080> doing<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.430> might<00:03:06.730> be<00:03:07.000> able<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.330> I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
after doing that you might be able to I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.750 
after doing that you might be able to I
mean<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.840> might<00:03:08.050> be<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.560> fresh<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.640> could

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
mean it might be so fresh that you could

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
mean it might be so fresh that you could
then<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.060> go<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.270> into<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.510> incline

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
then just go right into your incline

this remains stimulated you do your
increment<00:03:17.230> press<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.590> like<00:03:17.740> oh<00:03:17.890> I'm

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
increment press here like oh I'm

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.730 
increment press here like oh I'm
getting<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.060> now<00:03:19.090> right<00:03:19.990> because<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.620> you're

doing is you're you're taking the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.280 
doing is you're you're taking the
nervous<00:03:22.180> system<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.570> you're<00:03:22.660> saying<00:03:22.870> leave

you got to stimulate those phasic

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 
you got to stimulate those phasic
muscles<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.390> then<00:04:09.900> integrate

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
muscles so that you can then integrate

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.380 
muscles so that you can then integrate
it<00:04:10.620> very<00:04:11.220> important<00:04:11.640> now<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.819> integrate<00:04:12.150> it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
it very important now to integrate it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.740 
it very important now to integrate it
back<00:04:12.510> into<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> full<00:04:13.380> push<00:04:14.090> pattern<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.599> know
