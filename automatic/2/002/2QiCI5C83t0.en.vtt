00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.420 

this<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.490> my<00:00:03.000> upgrade<00:00:03.859> there<00:00:04.859> are<00:00:04.950> delay<00:00:05.220> or

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
this is my upgrade there are delay or

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.009 
this is my upgrade there are delay or
combination<00:00:06.060> safe<00:00:07.760> so<00:00:08.760> 60<00:00:09.269> deal<00:00:09.480> basically

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
combination safe so 60 deal basically

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.620 
combination safe so 60 deal basically
the<00:00:10.320> same<00:00:10.530> thing<00:00:10.830> but<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.450> upgraded<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
the same thing but I upgraded the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.560 
the same thing but I upgraded the
mechanism<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:14.870> can<00:00:15.870> say<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.560> same

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
mechanism in it can say so the same

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.099 
mechanism in it can say so the same
locked<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:19.260> open<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:21.619> yeah<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.900> will

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
locked can open it yeah so and this will

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
locked can open it yeah so and this will
likely<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.920> last<00:00:26.250> Lego<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:29.240> I'm

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
likely be my last Lego video because I'm

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.749 
likely be my last Lego video because I'm
getting<00:00:30.420> older<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.900> I'm<00:00:31.080> not<00:00:31.289> really

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
getting older and I'm not really

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.830 
getting older and I'm not really
interested<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.850> Legos<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.239> much<00:00:33.540> anymore

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
interested in Legos that much anymore

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
interested in Legos that much anymore
and<00:00:35.750> I'm<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> busy<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
and I'm kind of busy I have a lot of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
and I'm kind of busy I have a lot of
stuff<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.450> don't<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.719> much<00:00:39.989> time

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
stuff to do and I don't have much time

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.220 
stuff to do and I don't have much time
to<00:00:40.680> build<00:00:41.309> anything<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.480> sort<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> ran<00:00:43.200> out

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to build anything and I sort of ran out

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.770 
to build anything and I sort of ran out
of<00:00:43.350> ideas<00:00:43.559> too

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
of ideas too

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.400 
of ideas too
so<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> open<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:47.719> turn<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> dial<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.140> couple<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so to open it turn the dial a couple of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310 
so to open it turn the dial a couple of
times<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> three<00:00:51.510> color

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
times and now it has a three color

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
times and now it has a three color
combination<00:00:53.129> first<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.270> yellow<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.070> then<00:00:56.070> one

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
combination first to yellow and then one

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
combination first to yellow and then one
full<00:00:57.180> rotation<00:00:57.329> passed<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:59.270> back<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.510> blue<00:01:00.920> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
full rotation passed it back to blue and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
full rotation passed it back to blue and
then<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> clear<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.309> open<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.110> run<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
then so clear you can open it and run it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.730 
then so clear you can open it and run it
up<00:01:08.060> have<00:01:09.619> some<00:01:10.619> silver<00:01:13.369> quarters<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> with

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
up have some silver quarters and with

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
up have some silver quarters and with
some<00:01:16.920> half<00:01:17.130> dollars<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
some half dollars and I don't think I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.880 
some half dollars and I don't think I
will<00:01:25.590> show<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> mechanism<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.259> for<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
will show the mechanism in this for I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.450 
will show the mechanism in this for I
guess<00:01:29.820> two<00:01:30.180> main<00:01:30.360> reasons<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> too<00:01:32.280> many

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
guess two main reasons one is a too many

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
guess two main reasons one is a too many
people<00:01:32.820> copy<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.299> creations<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.170> giving

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
people copy my creations and not giving

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.609 
people copy my creations and not giving
me<00:01:34.530> credit<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.720> for<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:36.869> who<00:01:37.049> did<00:01:37.290> give<00:01:37.470> me

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
me credit and for those who did give me

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.990 
me credit and for those who did give me
credit<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.420> appreciate<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
credit I I really appreciate it and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.870 
credit I I really appreciate it and
everybody<00:01:42.000> else<00:01:42.060> should<00:01:42.299> whoever<00:01:43.579> watches<00:01:44.579> my

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
everybody else should whoever watches my

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
everybody else should whoever watches my
videos<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.479> build<00:01:45.659> something<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.259> exactly

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
videos to build something that's exactly

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
videos to build something that's exactly
the<00:01:46.829> same<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.100> mine<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:49.909> yeah<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.270> been

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the same as mine so yeah there's been

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
the same as mine so yeah there's been
more<00:01:51.689> people<00:01:51.960> who<00:01:52.320> don't<00:01:52.619> give<00:01:52.799> me<00:01:52.950> credit

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
more people who don't give me credit

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
more people who don't give me credit
than<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.700> give<00:01:53.909> me<00:01:54.060> credit<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:55.229> those<00:01:55.439> people

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
than do give me credit but those people

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.399 
than do give me credit but those people
that<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.399> thank<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> very<00:01:57.840> much<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.320> really

appreciate it and another reason that I

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
appreciate it and another reason that I
might<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.020> show<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> mechanism<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:06.780> because

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
might not show the mechanism is because

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 
might not show the mechanism is because
I'll<00:02:08.849> keep<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.509> secret<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:10.349> my<00:02:10.470> last

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
I'll keep this one a secret be my last

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.990 
I'll keep this one a secret be my last
lego<00:02:11.069> video<00:02:13.129> I'll<00:02:14.129> keep<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.519> one<00:02:15.290> my<00:02:16.290> secret

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
lego video I'll keep this one my secret

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.400 
lego video I'll keep this one my secret
I'll<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.120> my<00:02:18.300> mechanism<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:22.170> pretty

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
I'll be my mechanism so that's pretty

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:32.720 
I'll be my mechanism so that's pretty
much<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.860> guess<00:02:30.379> combination<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.730> it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
much it I guess combination and it's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.430 
much it I guess combination and it's
lost<00:02:32.940> yet<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.959> thank<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.019> all<00:02:37.140> for

on<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.519> stuff<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.209> most<00:02:45.540> likely<00:02:46.049> not<00:02:46.230> Legos

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
on other stuff but most likely not Legos

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.530 
on other stuff but most likely not Legos
I<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:49.170> kind<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.030> getting<00:02:51.030> bored<00:02:51.420> with

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
I was I'm kind of getting bored with

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:02.930 
I was I'm kind of getting bored with
them<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:52.110> kind<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:54.829> guess<00:02:58.340> so<00:03:00.470> yeah<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.790> was

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
them or kind of I guess so yeah that was

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.660 
them or kind of I guess so yeah that was
basically<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.780> upgraded<00:03:04.650> third<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
basically my upgraded third like a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.599 
basically my upgraded third like a
combination<00:03:06.120> say
