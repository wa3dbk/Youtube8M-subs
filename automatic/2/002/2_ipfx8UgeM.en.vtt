 time for now I'm going to advance 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.920
 do not carry with that umbrella especially the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 capital of the country because the rains 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 they continue to explain what is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.900
 passing low pressure channel are the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 northeast of our territory it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.550
 extends precisely towards the center of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.780
 the republic bringing with it 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.640
 roughness we have some wind on 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.160
 everything on the coast of the gulf we continue 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 with surada event on tamaulipas one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 little in veracruz extends to

 zacatecas as well as chihuahua 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 besides this we continue with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 temperature is very very warm and that is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.750
 keep us well hydrated because of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 here for the reale temperatures that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.890
 will present as quite high enough 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.539
 in this satellite image precisely 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 let's see what is happening 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.559
 at this moment we have out there in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 some points located some of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.579
 cloudiness in the northwest 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.199
 clear skies the same situation is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.449
 It presents a coahuila and for both 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250
 new lion to take 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.020
 probability of precipitation that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.700
 extends over the Mexican emptiness 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.219
 the center of the republic as well as 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.719
 also the south of the pacific in the caribbean 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.000
 Mexican what's important will continue 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.679
 being the high temperatures we are going to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.939
 see the maximum temperatures in some 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.340
 of the main cities of our 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.350
 country where you live and when 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.670
 reaches 19 degrees Celsius in the case 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.280
 from mexicalli 32

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.600
 heat in Ciudad Juarez 31 for city 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.640
 which we are left with 33 in the case of

 centigrade in the Mexican shoal in 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.189
 some probability points of 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.140
 precipitation maybe the lion case 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.789
 with 30 degrees centigrade to my photos and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.189

 Later that rain returns in some 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.840

 temperatures between 23 24 degrees with 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 south precipitation probability 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.740
 southeast of our country where taking 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 continued as I said the important thing 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.630
 continue being the high temperatures 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.820

 will approach the weekend with that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.090
 probability of precipitation we reach 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.170
 26 degrees felt for next days 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.800

 today if we have some wind if there is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.350
