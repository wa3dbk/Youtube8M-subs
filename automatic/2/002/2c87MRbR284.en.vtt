00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:39.889 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.830 

you<00:06:40.340> do<00:06:40.490> not<00:06:40.669> have<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.150> run<00:06:41.330> back<00:06:41.539> into<00:06:41.719> the

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
you do not have to run back into the

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.499 
you do not have to run back into the
helicopter<00:06:42.349> at<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:42.500> end<00:06:42.650> by<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.830> way<00:06:43.509> the

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
helicopter at the end by the way the

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.790 
helicopter at the end by the way the
first<00:06:44.659> time<00:06:44.870> I<00:06:44.960> tried<00:06:45.229> this<00:06:45.259> I<00:06:45.530> thought<00:06:45.680> you

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
first time I tried this I thought you

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.040 
first time I tried this I thought you
had<00:06:45.889> to<00:06:45.949> run<00:06:46.099> back<00:06:46.250> in<00:06:46.400> the<00:06:46.430> helicopter<00:06:47.050> so

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
had to run back in the helicopter so

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.439 
had to run back in the helicopter so
with<00:06:48.229> five<00:06:48.500> seconds<00:06:48.919> left<00:06:49.099> or<00:06:49.310> so<00:06:49.520> I<00:06:49.789> would

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
with five seconds left or so I would

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.850 
with five seconds left or so I would
always<00:06:50.629> kind<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:51.050> run<00:06:51.289> back<00:06:51.469> towards<00:06:51.770> a

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
always kind of run back towards a

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.379 
always kind of run back towards a
helicopter<00:06:52.460> and<00:06:53.169> I'd<00:06:54.169> usually<00:06:54.560> end<00:06:54.710> up<00:06:54.830> dying

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
helicopter and I'd usually end up dying

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.820 
helicopter and I'd usually end up dying
so<00:06:56.389> don't<00:06:56.569> worry<00:06:56.690> about<00:06:56.960> running<00:06:57.289> towards<00:06:57.680> the

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
so don't worry about running towards the

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.129 
so don't worry about running towards the
helicopter<00:06:57.979> when<00:06:58.460> it<00:06:58.520> comes<00:06:58.699> in<00:06:58.940> just<00:06:59.139> keep

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
helicopter when it comes in just keep

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.959 
helicopter when it comes in just keep
the<00:07:00.289> enemies<00:07:00.620> away<00:07:00.830> from<00:07:00.979> the<00:07:01.069> hostages<00:07:01.250> and

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:01.969 
the enemies away from the hostages and

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:09.129 
the enemies away from the hostages and
