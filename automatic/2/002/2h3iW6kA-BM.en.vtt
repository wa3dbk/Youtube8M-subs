00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the middle and you had a kind of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.070 
the middle and you had a kind of
dissonance<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:34.940> really<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:38.450> know<00:02:39.050> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.070 
dissonance but not really so you know I
that<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> little<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:40.840> depending<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.930> each

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
that a little bit depending on each

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.420 
that a little bit depending on each
measure<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.500> try<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.800> switch<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.160> off<00:02:43.190> each

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
measure I try to switch it off each

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.940
