00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.850
 base of knowledge to believe and to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.860
 ahead you have a blueprint for the future 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.660
 with the google docs tag and I heard you 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.370

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.010
 next thing next year 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.530
 ring always play with the guys but I 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.150
 do not focus too much on brand work 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.880
 google docs docs character not me 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
 I really like naha games so it's the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.360

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.140
 versatility in the root ps in clothing 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.269
 anyone in any type of game is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.090
 as someone who participated in the first 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.950
 institutions of xl there is also how 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.760
 analyze the event session I think it's 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.730
 The cool structure is so cool, I think. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.799
 always comes very well right is increasingly they 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.590
 1 opening new niches I found myself 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.670
 sensational the idea of ​​joining the sport 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.380
 With youtube, see. 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.170
 came to youtube girls' gallery 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.820
 going crazy is also very good this 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.780
 approach in which what the public has 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.220
 with youtube 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.329
 I also found the new reality 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.700
