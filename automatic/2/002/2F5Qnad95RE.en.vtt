00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everyone with you maracasi today i 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.790
 would like to talk about to mind on easy 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 tank level seven 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.040
 m41 walker bulldog them this tank you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 you can try on a test server 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 I personally have already done it and the whole machine 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
 I liked 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 Of course there are also disadvantages and advantages, but let's 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 all in order we start with a gun I him 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 I will compare in many ways 171 because 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 cannon are very similar and walter bulldog 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.969
 there are ten shells in the drum this 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.370
 very much of course just incredible 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.670
 the number of shells is not always you even 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 have time to put them all in the enemy 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 because the enemy is already starting to attack on 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 you and you just go to recharge 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 to somehow 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.109
 wait but still sometimes manages everything 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.210
 ten shells to plant in somebody 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.140
 recharge between shots 2 seconds 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 as with t71 in general it is not very long 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.409
 but sometimes still want faster but 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.890
 so infuriates and norms recharge time 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 drum at t71 of course smaller about 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 17 18 seconds but he certainly has a projectile 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.259
 in a smaller drum but true 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 note that 10 shells 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.299
 I personally very rarely succeeded 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 defuse the enemy in most 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740
 cases there are six shells I cut 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.470
 then went to recharge because 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 enemies have greatly warmed me 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.220
 but still sometimes 10 shells can 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 how to attach 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.020
 recharge at m41 about 27 28 seconds 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.840
 that is, much more breakthrough 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.840
 the same 175 armor-piercing whole for 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 seventh level is quite good without 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 light tank still have mobility 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.159
 and 210 gold is also acceptable and breaking through 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.250
 average alpha strike 150 units 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.110
 given that we have 10 shells it too 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.400
 quite 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.170
 poor accuracy rather mediocre 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.130
 04 course 100 meter range 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.660
 pretty big but there is a quick 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.480
 data 21 is even faster than t71 and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.660
 in general, a very good gun, I think 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.790
 she will like many players 10 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.310
 shells still in the drum once 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.800
 free fun like that shoot 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.200
 constantly in the enemy like a machine gun 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.580
 although it is sometimes difficult so here 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.140
 constant explore and and 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.480
 implement each projectile in size 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 M41 tank I would say that he did not 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.780
 small as the DLT 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.150
 it is much more than t71 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.590
 compare at least 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.860
 m41 is much higher wider in size 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.860
 about like t69 the only thing that 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.900
 width of course less may be 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.840
 length too 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.820
 in general, the tank is not so small 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 although in principle you can hide it 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.570
 fairly easy strength loss of a daughter 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.330
 a little more on 70 units in general 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.739
 not such a big plus considering all 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:30.890
 the same size of this tank mass in m41 too 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.450
 large by 7 tons approximate but 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.970
 this and the engine is more powerful than 550 horse 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.830
 forces and in the end it turns out very good 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.930
 dynamics really speed 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.180
 rather quickly 72 kilometers 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.799
 per hour the maximum speed is even greater 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.380
 than t71 and at the same time much it is of course 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:59.000
 significant plus turning speed 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.890
 chassis is the same as t71 reservation 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.960
 missing you can say it 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.840
 and no 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.120
 punch all absolutely unique 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.290
 there may be ricochets sometimes 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.530
 but this is not so, and often the review is the same 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.600
 and principle 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.090
 m41 walker bulldog as you can see 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.150
 has such obvious advantages 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.210
 but at the same time he also has disadvantages 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.180
 I also consider it a huge plus 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.690
 the tank is a great event that is a gun down 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.000
 falls very well like many 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.920
 Americans is of course a huge plus 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.950
 because on any map you can find 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.200
 you can shoot yourself there 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.080
 poke only one tower for later 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 it was harder to get in and that of course 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.070
 just super 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.800
 also as you can see at the tank 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:54.310
 excellent stabilization can be distributed 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.290
 communities on the go just so and this of course 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.570
 just super as you can easily 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.850
 spin any adversary and when 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.400
 it will still be very accurate for it 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.820
 shoot for sure this tank will 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.940
 such a nightmare eternal trouble art because 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.310
 what if he breaks off to her and will 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.100
 correctly maneuver it for ten 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.040
 shells can there three arty calmly 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.200
 destroy if everything is ok and 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.290
 all shells hit the mark 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.350
 Well, in general, turned out very nice 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.320
 fan tank which will surely find 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.980
 about many fans and many will be on it 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.820
 play and of course I liked the tanchik 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.670
 but it is worth noting that m41 walker bulldog 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.510
 it's not such a simple tank as it can 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.330
 seem 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.120
 someone will say here are ten shells there 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.070
 flew to anyone and neither disassembled them 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.800
 There in two accounts but not so and all 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.870
 just the fact is that the battle is not so 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.960
 many moments where you can 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.600
 really widow shoot off by 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.030
 the enemy in most cases the enemy 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.060
 starts to somehow aggravate on you and 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.880
 absolutely not giving you the opportunity to 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.840
 where to shoot so this tank requires 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.330
 still concentration patience 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.940
 knowledge of the game that is competent player 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.570
 you can really forward it 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.930
 pros 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.419
 but illiterate I think it will be often on 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.680
 merge it I think that he will go now 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:28.960
 I discharge my drum in all but not here 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.530
 it was sometimes done wrong 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.870
 simply 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.100
 By the way, in general, it turns out pretty 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.710
 interesting branch especially liked him 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.639
 t49 I think it is quite possible to pump 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.700
 this thread 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.919
 fans for such a machine and of this 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.050
 all friends thank you so much 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.810
 watched don't forget to subscribe to 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.840
 channel and put huskies and see you soon 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.840
 until
