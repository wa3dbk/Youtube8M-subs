00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.310
 online shopping at 19 point ru 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.109
 today i would like to tell you about 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.350
 the novelty that came to us in 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.010
 the shop is interesting laminate with 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.869
 interesting characteristics is 33 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 the class 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 thickness of the plate is 12 millimeters and with so 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.129
 called u-shaped bevel that is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.610
 recently become customers today and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.329
 ask if you have such laminate 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 exactly 33 grade 12 meter boards with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.350
 chamfer that's why I brought such a laminate 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 Now it is available for sale by our 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 online store 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.870
 that is, I would like to draw your attention 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.140
 on his 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 interesting properties that is this thing 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.950
 of course the first thing to pay attention to is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.869
 v-chamfer that is unlike 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 v-shaped chamfer u-shaped chamfer has 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.110
 he has a gentle view 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.650
 the bend is pretty nasty not sharp here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.189
 there is less dirt and dust 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.189
 most like 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.970
 the presence of chamfer remains 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.920
 there is no such effect as hit 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.820
 dirt in the gap here is the second point means u 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.750
 this laminate castle connection 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.720
 waxed or waxed i.e. 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.610
 and to the touch it is felt 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.750
 this is additional protection against hitting 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.560
 water 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.560
 moisture 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.570
 inside that is thereby increasing 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.500
 water resistance of the laminate itself as a whole and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.780
 thereby increasing the service life that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 I want to pay attention means it 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.820

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.290
 soft calm that is inherent 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.810
