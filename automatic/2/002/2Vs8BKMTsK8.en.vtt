00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
less that's it this rounded toe stop

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.600 
less that's it this rounded toe stop
here<00:01:19.909> it's<00:01:20.909> gonna<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.369> same

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
here it's gonna be more for the same

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.219 
here it's gonna be more for the same
purpose<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> rounded

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
purpose but because of that rounded

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
purpose but because of that rounded
profile<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.430> gonna<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.700> better<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.150> doing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
profile it's gonna be better for doing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
profile it's gonna be better for doing
free<00:01:27.659> drifts<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.170> stuff<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
free drifts and stuff like that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
free drifts and stuff like that
holding<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.479> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
holding you on for that because as your

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
foot goes into the pre drift you can

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
foot goes into the pre drift you can
kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> bend<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.630> toes<00:01:33.869> around<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.500> toe

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
stop and as the back goes out you still

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
stop and as the back goes out you still
have<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.890> angle<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.340> work<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
have that angle to work with you can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760
