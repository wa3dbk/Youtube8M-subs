00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
that was a great shot Steve now if we

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.390 
that was a great shot Steve now if we
take<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> look<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.779> your<00:00:18.960> flare<00:00:19.350> rings<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
take a look at your flare rings you can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.460 
take a look at your flare rings you can
see<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> very<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.359> flowering<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
see the very first flowering that you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
see the very first flowering that you
have<00:00:22.760> by<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.970> oil<00:00:24.330> line<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.810> gonna<00:00:24.869> trace

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
have by this oil line we're gonna trace

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
have by this oil line we're gonna trace
it<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.619> outline<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.070> until<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> pretty

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it and outline it until we get a pretty

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250 
it and outline it until we get a pretty
good<00:00:27.840> picture<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.980> Falls<00:00:29.550> flare<00:00:30.260> rotation

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
good picture of the Falls flare rotation

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.069 
good picture of the Falls flare rotation
now<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> flare<00:00:32.969> ring<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
now if we have this flare ring we have a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.209 
now if we have this flare ring we have a
device<00:00:35.270> such<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.800> typically<00:00:37.800> called<00:00:38.070> an

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
device such as this typically called an

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.490 
device such as this typically called an
armadillo<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:39.239> were<00:00:39.390> able<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.469> has

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
armadillo we were able to do is it has

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
armadillo we were able to do is it has
rings<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:42.090> rings<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.260> match

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
rings in here these rings if you match

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
rings in here these rings if you match
up<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.160> flare<00:00:44.520> line<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.480> give

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
up to your flare line will actually give

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
up to your flare line will actually give
us<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.500> PAP<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.730> by<00:00:47.910> sliding<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.539> around

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
us your PAP so by sliding this around

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
us your PAP so by sliding this around
left<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> right<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.860> able<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.309> match<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
left to right we're able to match up the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.500 
left to right we're able to match up the
closest<00:00:51.480> ring<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.280> white<00:00:53.820> grease<00:00:54.149> pencil

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
closest ring to the white grease pencil

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.590 
closest ring to the white grease pencil
that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.840> used<00:00:55.730> we<00:00:56.730> trace<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.090> backwards

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that we just used we trace it backwards

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.670 
that we just used we trace it backwards
to<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.430> now<00:01:00.350> we<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.500> your

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to this point here and now we have your

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.850 
to this point here and now we have your
positive<00:01:02.160> access<00:01:02.579> point<00:01:03.500> alternatively<00:01:04.500> if

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
positive access point alternatively if

positive access point alternatively if
your<00:01:05.309> Pro<00:01:05.489> Shop<00:01:05.700> doesn't<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.240> armadillo

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
your Pro Shop doesn't have an armadillo

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
your Pro Shop doesn't have an armadillo
when<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.020> trying<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> find<00:01:07.680> your

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
when they're trying to find your

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.830 
when they're trying to find your
positive<00:01:08.280> access<00:01:08.640> point<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.299> possible<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
positive access point it's possible to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
positive access point it's possible to
use<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> ball<00:01:10.229> spinner<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.010> let<00:01:11.130> me<00:01:11.250> show<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
use a ball spinner so let me show you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.179 
use a ball spinner so let me show you
how<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.610> techniques<00:01:12.150> done<00:01:12.710> using<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> flare

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
how that techniques done using the flare

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
how that techniques done using the flare
lines<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.729> located<00:01:15.170> when<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.380> first

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
lines that we located when we are first

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
lines that we located when we are first
throwing<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> ball<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
throwing the ball what you do is you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.499 
throwing the ball what you do is you
place<00:01:18.479> them<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:20.509> very

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
place them so that they are very

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
place them so that they are very
parallel<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> ball<00:01:22.710> spinner<00:01:22.950> itself<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
parallel to the ball spinner itself so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.679 
parallel to the ball spinner itself so
now<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.210> turn<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> ball<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:26.299> we're<00:01:27.299> able<00:01:27.570> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
now if we turn the ball on we're able to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.469 
now if we turn the ball on we're able to
see<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> line<00:01:28.409> bounces<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.390> what

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
see the line bounces up and down so what

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.560 
see the line bounces up and down so what
I<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> turn<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> ball<00:01:31.530> span<00:01:31.770> off

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
I want to do is turn the ball span off

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.310 
I want to do is turn the ball span off
take<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> line<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> rotate<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> slightly

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
take the line and rotate it slightly

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
take the line and rotate it slightly
until<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> solid<00:01:38.240> line<00:01:39.240> such<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
until we get a solid line such as this

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.460 
until we get a solid line such as this
once<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> solid<00:01:41.400> line<00:01:42.350> hold<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
once you have the solid line hold the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.719 
once you have the solid line hold the
grease<00:01:43.649> pencil<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> top<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.579> ball

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
grease pencil to the top of the ball

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.120 
grease pencil to the top of the ball
you'll<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.860> tight

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you'll see that we have a really tight

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
you'll see that we have a really tight
concise<00:01:47.610> location<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:51.840> course<00:01:51.869> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
concise location and this of course is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840
