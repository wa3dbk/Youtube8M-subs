obvious movement I didn't want to do the
obvious<00:01:28.710> flamethrower<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.579> give<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
obvious flamethrower to me give that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
obvious flamethrower to me give that
thing<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.150> power<00:01:30.299> boost<00:01:30.540> weisgerber<00:01:31.110> flames

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
thing a power boost weisgerber flames

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.480 
thing a power boost weisgerber flames
but<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.590> right<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.799> his<00:01:31.979> Houndoom<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
but all right now his Houndoom is in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.700 
but all right now his Houndoom is in
trouble<00:01:32.729> he's<00:01:33.570> got<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> switch<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.470> I'm

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
trouble he's got a switch because I'm

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.990 
trouble he's got a switch because I'm
just<00:01:34.860> faster<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> tape<00:01:35.640> her<00:01:35.729> mouth<00:01:35.759> she

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just faster than the tape her mouth she

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
just faster than the tape her mouth she
goes<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.299> mushroom<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> knew<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
goes in a mushroom on now I knew you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
goes in a mushroom on now I knew you
know<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> can't<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
know that can't just go for a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
know that can't just go for a
flamethrower<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.229> opt<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
flamethrower so actually just opt for a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
flamethrower so actually just opt for a
volt<00:01:40.860> switch<00:01:40.950> instead<00:01:41.540> we're<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.689> gonna<00:01:42.810> do

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
volt switch instead we're just gonna do

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.270 
volt switch instead we're just gonna do
is<00:01:43.079> solve<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.409> damage<00:01:43.649> than<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> guess<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is solve on damage than I guess what you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450 
is solve on damage than I guess what you
managed<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.390> less<00:01:46.259> Lucas<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.310> get

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
managed on this less Lucas so go get

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
managed on this less Lucas so go get
tornadoes<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.939> i<00:01:47.970> said<00:01:48.090> i'm<00:01:48.180> almost<00:01:48.840> at

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
tornadoes like i said i'm almost at

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
tornadoes like i said i'm almost at
about<00:01:49.500> full<00:01:49.770> he<00:01:49.920> i<00:01:50.130> missing<00:01:50.369> over<00:01:50.549> her<00:01:50.670> care

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
 dead I get a crit that probably

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
 dead I get a crit that probably
mattered<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.310> stabbed<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.240> don't

break out again though what does is the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
break out again though what does is the
metrics<00:02:03.540> i<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> intimidate<00:02:04.350> off<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
cuz I guess get Polly took at the rain

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.929 
cuz I guess get Polly took at the rain
up<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.299> i<00:02:34.659> know<00:02:34.719> i<00:02:34.810> could<00:02:35.049> live<00:02:35.169> anyway<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.680> I

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
up and i know i could live anyway and I

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.979 
up and i know i could live anyway and I
threaten<00:02:36.939> him<00:02:37.060> out<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.359> toxic<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
threaten him out with the toxic or I

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.479 
threaten him out with the toxic or I
could<00:02:38.139> set<00:02:38.409> him<00:02:38.469> up<00:02:38.560> by<00:02:38.709> scalding<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.280> burn

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
could set him up by scalding the burn

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.509 
could set him up by scalding the burn
but<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.139> got<00:02:41.139> a<00:02:41.169> lot<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.409> scalding<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.310> burn

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
but I got a lot of scalding the burn

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.309 
but I got a lot of scalding the burn
there's<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> phrase<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.329> just<00:02:43.480> used<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
there's a phrase that I just used but I

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.929 
there's a phrase that I just used but I
just<00:02:44.530> go<00:02:44.709> for<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.950> toxic<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.459> time<00:02:45.609> I<00:02:45.639> figured

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
just go for a toxic this time I figured

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.189 
just go for a toxic this time I figured
from<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> advantage<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.689> something<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.109> I'm

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:47.199 
from the advantage of something and I'm

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.509 
from the advantage of something and I'm
kind<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.590> glad<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:48.129> one<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.430> those

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
kind of glad it was one of those

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.759 
kind of glad it was one of those
ventilator<00:02:48.909> walls<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.659> then<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:49.989> he<00:02:50.230> wanted<00:02:50.650> to

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
ventilator walls so then if he wanted to

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.409 
ventilator walls so then if he wanted to
come<00:02:50.949> in<00:02:51.010> later<00:02:51.310> possibly<00:02:51.639> have<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.060> chance<00:02:52.299> of

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
come in later possibly have a chance of

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.149 
come in later possibly have a chance of
stall<00:02:52.689> me<00:02:52.870> out<00:02:52.900> he<00:02:53.109> couldn't<00:02:53.379> because<00:02:53.859> it's

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
stall me out he couldn't because it's

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.339
