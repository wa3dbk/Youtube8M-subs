00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.279
 something dear friends again we are 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.990
 here in the fuck I'm going to clarify a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.810
 little more than dragon ball so we were 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.460
 talking about dragon ball z the new 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.260
 movie that opens in 2013 and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.750
 we talk about that but today I want to 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.990
 speak from 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.060
 first with me the in the hand I do not know if 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 will come to see the stars hopefully 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 if it is the ball of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.410
 two stars hopefully you can see it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.380
 well because not everyone can have 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.290
 one of these in your hand is real 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.410
 so if you can 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.900
 to similar good with me the two 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 Stars in my hand are still missing 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.430
 a few let's go step by step I want 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.150
 talk to them a little about professing 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.730
 dragon ball z sayÃ¡n saga that was made 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.770
 now in the evasion as he says with 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.400
 great bone actors was performed in 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.489
 england this is a production that does not 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.820
 has no official connection with what 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.040
 what would be the dragon ball z or any of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.660
 the companies that were always 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.850
 associated with all this type of projects 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.950
 much less with the creator here already 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.310
 trite then this is a project 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.350
 that was founded let's say it was the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.479
 money put by the fans this was done 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.229
 through a website that this site 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.320
 web what it allows is that one contributes what 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.180
 which can for example then as 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.369
 that one can contribute is also what 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.259
 will receive in exchange for example if one 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.619
 I had the opportunity to put 750 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.770
 dollars could also help 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.320
 this project became a reality 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.940
 stay with the armor you use 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 I was in this 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.070
 trier call an extended trailer but 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.690
 it's a trailer if it does not become 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.600
 wrong or a movie is rather 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.540
 a trailer for a movie that never 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.710
 will exist 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.270
 then this project sumo I'm going to 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.860
 look at it exactly this project 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.600
 I needed 5000 dollars that what 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.950
 because they were asking themselves 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.920
 they are going to put five thousand dollars more of their 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.050
 own pocket because this really 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.740
 you need a lot of special effects that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.990
 need actors a little put money in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.300
 makeup in the virtual and so on this 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.930
 it's a lot of money then but 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.200
 five thousand who asked in a start 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.150
 finished with 14 thousand 273 the truth that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.490
 for me that's amazing and I think that 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.770
 also this money a little is reflected 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.630
 in the final project they could do 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.400
 certain things did not have planned in a 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.720
 start as for example go to a study 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.270
 professional where they have signed 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.280
 amazing movies movies 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.870
 hollywood let's say like james bond 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.880
 for example in one of the last week 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.489
 in this study I mean the whole 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.230
 what is on green screen that would be 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.340
 he chromaes all the scenes that are 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.290
 flying the joke the decision to a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.030
 very professional studio 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.620
 thanks to the money that put people 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.049
 what did you put maybe you 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.609
 then a dollar 10 100 and then to which 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.010
 this would come true 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.290
 then I'm going to let you see 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.060
 a little bit of this here as the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.260
 images of this trailer here to me 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.500
 left this trailer starts a little 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.560
 showing what happens when 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.989
 vegueta or vegeta or belgium as you would say 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.329
 in Japanese it reaches the earth with napa 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.239
 these two beings that come from the planet 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.760
 Visit the planet vegueta or whatever you want 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.680
 call it come from that planet in your 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.019
 ships land on earth and what 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.150
 they make that monkey get to destroy everything 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.489
 but they are like our 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.500
 comrades our zetas warriors 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.240
 are prepared for 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 to face them in this case we are 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.640
 talking about those who refuse first 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.140
 obviously we first see a scene 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.850

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.069
