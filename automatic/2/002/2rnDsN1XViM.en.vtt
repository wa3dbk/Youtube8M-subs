00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
think about even getting this game to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.310 
think about even getting this game to
work<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.109> windows<00:00:25.980> 7<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:27.240> need<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
work on windows 7 you need to have a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.250 
work on windows 7 you need to have a
good<00:00:28.740> graphics<00:00:29.279> card<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.990> I<00:00:30.990> think

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
good graphics card and I think

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
good graphics card and I think
specifically<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> should<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.730> Nvidia

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
specifically you should get a Nvidia

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.479 
specifically you should get a Nvidia
graphics<00:00:33.540> card<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> game<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
graphics card because this game is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.139 
graphics card because this game is
designed<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:37.040> Nvidia<00:00:38.040> graphics<00:00:38.219> card<00:00:38.790> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
designed for an Nvidia graphics card so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
designed for an Nvidia graphics card so
if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.469> type<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:40.890> it's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
if you have a different type but it's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
if you have a different type but it's
good<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.550> might<00:00:42.210> work<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.719> might<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:43.050> work<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
configure and let me just lower the

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.990 
configure and let me just lower the
resolution<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.490> let<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:17.850> try<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
resolution that's it let me try that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.149

and I'll show you guys that this is

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.910 
and I'll show you guys that this is
Windows<00:01:44.970> 7<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> yeah<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> go

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the screen resolution Oh only from the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.830 
the screen resolution Oh only from the
main<00:02:03.000> menu<00:02:03.180> okay<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.619> exit<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:06.799> options

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
main menu okay so exit game options

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.540 
main menu okay so exit game options
screen<00:02:09.470> resolution<00:02:11.050> let's<00:02:12.050> make<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.709> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
screen resolution let's make it to the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.720 
screen resolution let's make it to the
highest<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.950> by<00:02:15.950> doing<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.700> makes

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
highest and by doing that it makes

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.970 
highest and by doing that it makes
everything<00:02:17.239> smaller<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:19.330> also<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:21.170> makes

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
everything smaller and also it makes

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.630 
everything smaller and also it makes
everything<00:02:22.489> wider<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.300> game<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.519> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
everything wider in the game so as you

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.469 
Nvidia graphics card because I've seen
computers<00:07:12.439> that<00:07:12.560> have<00:07:12.789> Nvidia<00:07:13.789> graphics<00:07:13.909> card

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
computers that have Nvidia graphics card

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:16.860 
computers that have Nvidia graphics card
and<00:07:14.659> they<00:07:14.900> don't<00:07:15.080> work<00:07:15.319> in<00:07:15.529> their<00:07:15.710> Windows<00:07:16.009> XP

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
and they don't work in their Windows XP

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.100 
and they don't work in their Windows XP
so<00:07:17.870> you<00:07:18.469> need<00:07:18.590> a<00:07:18.650> good<00:07:18.860> card<00:07:19.610> and<00:07:19.939> you<00:07:20.120> need<00:07:20.330> to

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
so you need a good card and you need to

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.950 
so you need a good card and you need to
have<00:07:21.860> a<00:07:21.889> little<00:07:22.189> bit<00:07:22.279> of<00:07:22.430> RAM<00:07:22.580> like<00:07:22.879> maybe<00:07:23.539> 5

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
have a little bit of RAM like maybe 5

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.429 
have a little bit of RAM like maybe 5
gigabytes<00:07:24.529> is<00:07:24.740> like<00:07:24.949> perfect<00:07:25.789> my<00:07:26.539> PC<00:07:27.050> has<00:07:27.139> 8

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
gigabytes is like perfect my PC has 8

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.339 
gigabytes is like perfect my PC has 8
which<00:07:27.830> is<00:07:28.009> also<00:07:28.279> like<00:07:28.759> incredible<00:07:29.330> eats<00:07:29.509> it's

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:30.349 
which is also like incredible eats it's

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.010 
which is also like incredible eats it's

like the best amount you can have if you
go<00:07:33.080> over<00:07:33.500> 8<00:07:33.650> gigabytes<00:07:34.129> then<00:07:34.400> you're<00:07:34.610> probably

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:34.789 
go over 8 gigabytes then you're probably

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.790 
go over 8 gigabytes then you're probably
going<00:07:34.999> to<00:07:35.150> be<00:07:35.240> playing<00:07:35.509> like<00:07:35.689> three<00:07:36.349> games<00:07:36.560> at
