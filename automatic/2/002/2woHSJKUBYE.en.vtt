kind<00:03:43.960> of<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.140> test<00:03:44.800> Chris<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.970> thing<00:03:46.150> about

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
kind of a test Chris and the thing about

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330 
kind of a test Chris and the thing about
we<00:03:46.510> got<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.900> two<00:03:47.260> supporting<00:03:47.740> beams<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.250> the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
we got to two supporting beams in the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.280 
we got to two supporting beams in the
neck<00:03:48.550> which<00:03:48.730> makes<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.030> next<00:03:49.300> stable<00:03:49.480> right<00:03:50.020> so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
neck which makes a next stable right so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.810 
neck which makes a next stable right so
you<00:03:50.350> got<00:03:50.530> all<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.830> stuff<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.370> then<00:03:51.490> on<00:03:51.520> top

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
you got all this stuff and then on top

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.940 
you got all this stuff and then on top
of<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.150> we've<00:03:52.330> got<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> great<00:03:52.900> we've<00:03:53.470> got<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> I

mean Garth came up with this particular

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.750 
mean Garth came up with this particular
design<00:03:56.080> great<00:03:56.530> great<00:03:56.950> style<00:03:57.280> which<00:03:57.550> is<00:03:57.640> very

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
design great great style which is very

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.880 
design great great style which is very
distinctive<00:03:58.510> yeah<00:03:58.750> puts<00:03:59.050> his<00:03:59.200> thumbprint<00:03:59.500> on

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
distinctive yeah puts his thumbprint on

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.430 
distinctive yeah puts his thumbprint on
the<00:04:00.310> guitar<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.600> sound<00:04:02.020> hole<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.410> be

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the guitar and and a sound hole can be

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.140 
the guitar and and a sound hole can be
any<00:04:02.709> size<00:04:03.070> but<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.490> thing<00:04:03.670> about<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.000> you

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
any size but the thing about it is you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.870 
any size but the thing about it is you
get<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> little<00:04:04.750> bit<00:04:04.840> more<00:04:04.990> volume<00:04:05.170> out<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.650> this

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
get a little bit more volume out of this

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.070 
get a little bit more volume out of this
you<00:04:06.880> do<00:04:07.030> get<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.270> little<00:04:07.420> bit<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.600> volume<00:04:07.780> out

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
you do get a little bit more volume out

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.360 
you do get a little bit more volume out
of<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.230> guitar<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.709> won't<00:04:08.920> say<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.130> at

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
of the guitar and I won't say that at

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.520 
of the guitar and I won't say that at
mirror<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:10.209> mirror<00:04:10.510> images<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.140> sound<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
mirror it mirror images the sound of the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.630 
mirror it mirror images the sound of the
guitar<00:04:11.620> because<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.160> would<00:04:12.250> be<00:04:12.370> way<00:04:12.580> too

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
guitar because that would be way too

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.730 
guitar because that would be way too
easy<00:04:12.820> but<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.810> neat<00:04:13.959> thing<00:04:13.990> about<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.500> we<00:04:14.620> got

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
easy but the neat thing about is we got

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.920 
easy but the neat thing about is we got
a<00:04:14.770> split<00:04:14.980> bridge<00:04:15.310> we've<00:04:15.910> got<00:04:16.060> an<00:04:16.180> on<00:04:16.390> pin

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
a split bridge we've got an on pin

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.140 
a split bridge we've got an on pin
bridge<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.830> really<00:04:18.160> truly<00:04:18.340> believe<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:18.820> if

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
bridge and I really truly believe and if

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.420 
bridge and I really truly believe and if
you<00:04:19.299> can<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.780> can<00:04:19.810> quote<00:04:20.080> me<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:21.220> non

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
you can you can quote me on this the non

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
you can you can quote me on this the non
pin<00:04:21.790> bridge<00:04:22.090> basically<00:04:22.660> gives<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.960> more<00:04:23.230> of<00:04:23.290> a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
pin bridge basically gives you more of a

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.890 
pin bridge basically gives you more of a
resonant<00:04:24.040> of<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.190> float<00:04:25.120> like<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.660> drum

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
resonant of a float like a like a drum

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.450 
resonant of a float like a like a drum
head<00:04:25.930> uh-huh<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.770> really<00:04:26.980> feel<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.220> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
head uh-huh and I really feel that I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.340 
head uh-huh and I really feel that I
like<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.360> pin<00:04:28.540> bridge<00:04:28.750> because<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.200> what<00:04:29.320> I

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
like the pin bridge because it's what I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.380 
like the pin bridge because it's what I
grew<00:04:29.440> up<00:04:29.620> with<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> non<00:04:30.700> pin<00:04:30.970> bridge<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
grew up with but the non pin bridge is a

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.120 
grew up with but the non pin bridge is a
great<00:04:31.630> design<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.200> is<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.380> split<00:04:32.710> bridge<00:04:32.980> as

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
great design this is a split bridge as

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.920 
great design this is a split bridge as
well<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.850> intonation<00:04:34.120> is<00:04:34.570> going<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.780> be

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
well so the intonation is going to be

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.890 
well so the intonation is going to be
just<00:04:35.620> all<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.310> way<00:04:36.340> up<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.940> neck<00:04:36.970> right<00:04:37.720> on

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
just all the way up the neck right on

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.380 
just all the way up the neck right on
the<00:04:38.020> money<00:04:38.200> based<00:04:38.980> on<00:04:39.160> on<00:04:39.370> Takamine<00:04:39.970> design

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
the money based on on Takamine design

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.420 
the money based on on Takamine design
here<00:04:40.919> something<00:04:41.919> I<00:04:41.980> didn't<00:04:42.160> point<00:04:42.310> out

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
here something I didn't point out

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.930 
here something I didn't point out
earlier<00:04:42.460> these<00:04:42.880> two<00:04:43.060> little<00:04:43.390> poor<00:04:43.930> Lloyd<00:04:44.110> dots

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
earlier these two little poor Lloyd dots

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.820 
earlier these two little poor Lloyd dots
is<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.270> an<00:04:46.390> anchor<00:04:46.810> for<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.260> bridge<00:04:47.530> it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
is it is an anchor for the bridge it

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.440 
is it is an anchor for the bridge it
stabilizes<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.610> bridge<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.090> basically

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
stabilizes the bridge and basically

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.240 
stabilizes the bridge and basically
pulls<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.870> pickup<00:04:50.320> up<00:04:50.500> underneath<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
pulls the pickup up underneath the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.580 
pulls the pickup up underneath the
saddles<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> lot<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.350> people<00:04:53.530> don't

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
saddles and so a lot of people don't

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.140 
saddles and so a lot of people don't
know<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:54.130> there's<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.370> separate<00:04:54.760> saddle

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
know that that there's a separate saddle

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.700 
know that that there's a separate saddle
under<00:04:55.390> here<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.810> separate<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.169> under<00:04:56.470> here

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
under here and a separate one under here

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.400 
under here and a separate one under here
that<00:04:56.740> hits<00:04:57.160> both<00:04:57.520> both<00:04:58.300> pieces<00:04:58.600> of<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
that hits both both pieces of the of the

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.010 
that hits both both pieces of the of the
saddle<00:04:59.760> material<00:05:00.760> just<00:05:01.000> amazing<00:05:01.419> how<00:05:01.539> clear

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
saddle material just amazing how clear

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.540 
saddle material just amazing how clear
the<00:05:02.200> guitar<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:02.860> got<00:05:03.010> such<00:05:03.250> an<00:05:03.400> awesome

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
the guitar is it's got such an awesome

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.230 
the guitar is it's got such an awesome
tone

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240

can actually line up with its tune hit
the<00:05:58.990> pitch<00:05:59.169> button<00:05:59.560> and<00:05:59.740> now<00:05:59.860> your<00:06:00.099> 448<00:06:00.849> or<00:06:01.150> 449
