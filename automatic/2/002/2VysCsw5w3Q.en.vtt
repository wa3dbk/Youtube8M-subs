00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
say that there's a three-step process

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
say that there's a three-step process
Curren<00:01:24.720> even<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> give

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
Curren even more than that but you give

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.080 
Curren even more than that but you give
them<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.920> least<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.310> steps<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:26.970> they

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
them at least three steps what are they

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
them at least three steps what are they
right<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> first<00:01:28.110> step<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> really

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right you know the first step is really

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
right you know the first step is really
become<00:01:29.009> aware<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.970> reason<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
become aware and the reason you want to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
become aware and the reason you want to
become<00:01:30.689> aware<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> most<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> time

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
become aware is that most of the time

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
become aware is that most of the time
our<00:01:32.130> lives<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.610> minds<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
our lives our minds just kind of go on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
our lives our minds just kind of go on
automatic<00:01:34.500> pilot<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.369> original

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
automatic pilot so we like that original

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.640 
automatic pilot so we like that original
programming<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> start<00:01:37.290> following

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
programming and we just start following

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.429 
programming and we just start following
it<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:38.970> become<00:01:39.509> aware<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it and so if you become aware it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.410 
it and so if you become aware it's
that's<00:01:40.770> your<00:01:40.979> choice<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that's your choice point it's when you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
that's your choice point it's when you
can<00:01:42.630> stop<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> stop<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> madness<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
can stop kind of stop the madness and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
can stop kind of stop the madness and
say<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> make<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> new<00:01:45.840> choice<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.380> life

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

have to set your intention and that's
kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.490> setting<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.090> internal<00:01:54.689> gps

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
it's saying here's where i'd like to go

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's saying here's where i'd like to go
and<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.560> allows<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.310> mind<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.880> kind

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
surroundings so that if you get off

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.569 
surroundings so that if you get off
course<00:02:04.200> ya<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.369> brain

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
course ya know that your little brain

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
course ya know that your little brain
goes<00:02:05.790> hey<00:02:06.030> hold<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> second<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.200> know

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
goes hey hold on a second you know

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
goes hey hold on a second you know
you're<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.890> deviating<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:08.849> you're<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you're you're deviating yeah you're a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
you're you're deviating yeah you're a
little<00:02:09.390> off<00:02:09.509> course<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> third

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
little off course and then the third

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.670 
little off course and then the third
step<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.610> i<00:02:11.670> call<00:02:11.879> let<00:02:12.599> go<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.930> flow

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
step is what i call let go and flow

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
step is what i call let go and flow
and<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.219> really<00:02:14.340> came<00:02:14.579> from<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.909> childhood

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
and that really came from a childhood

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.670 
and that really came from a childhood
experience<00:02:15.840> might<00:02:16.049> when<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.409> kid<00:02:16.500> people

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
experience might when I was a kid people

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.429 
experience might when I was a kid people
called<00:02:17.189> me<00:02:17.310> bam<00:02:17.519> bam<00:02:17.760> uh-huh<00:02:18.629> Nick<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.379> know

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
called me bam bam uh-huh Nick you know

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.449 
called me bam bam uh-huh Nick you know
that<00:02:19.650> tough<00:02:19.920> Flint's<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.609> was<00:02:20.879> okay<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that tough Flint's I was okay and so you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.009 
that tough Flint's I was okay and so you
know<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.579> used<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.909> just<00:02:24.060> kind<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.269> force<00:02:24.569> my<00:02:24.840> way

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
know I used to just kind of force my way

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.360 
know I used to just kind of force my way
in<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> world<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:25.859> I<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.219> had<00:02:26.340> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
in the world and so I really had to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.030 
in the world and so I really had to
learn<00:02:26.609> to<00:02:26.670> let<00:02:27.629> go<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:28.230> flow<00:02:28.469> meany<00:02:28.709> kind<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
learn to let go and flow meany kind of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.160 
learn to let go and flow meany kind of
trusting<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.670> process<00:02:30.019> setting<00:02:31.019> my

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
trusting the process setting my

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.289 
trusting the process setting my
intention<00:02:31.560> being<00:02:32.099> aware<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.879> moment<00:02:33.209> and

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
intention being aware in the moment and

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.899 
intention being aware in the moment and
then<00:02:33.420> allowing<00:02:34.139> things<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.709> unfold<00:02:35.189> right<00:02:35.609> and

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
then allowing things to unfold right and

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.789 
then allowing things to unfold right and
you<00:02:36.090> say<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.659> actually<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.079> little<00:02:37.500> bit

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
you say this is actually a little bit

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.369 
you say this is actually a little bit
different<00:02:38.340> than<00:02:38.519> say<00:02:38.730> goal<00:02:39.000> setting<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
different than say goal setting right it

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.559 
different than say goal setting right it
right<00:02:40.650> away<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:41.670> know<00:02:41.760> traditional<00:02:42.420> goal

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
right away you know traditional goal

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.240 
right away you know traditional goal
setting<00:02:42.840> quite<00:02:42.989> honestly<00:02:43.260> fails<00:02:43.620> more<00:02:44.010> times

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
setting quite honestly fails more times

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610 
setting quite honestly fails more times
than<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.519> succeeds<00:02:44.939> yeah<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:46.409> really

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
than it succeeds yeah and that's really

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.080 
than it succeeds yeah and that's really
important<00:02:47.220> for<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> understand<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
important for you to understand is that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.909 
important for you to understand is that
you<00:02:48.359> know<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.629> New<00:02:48.900> Year's<00:02:49.109> resolutions<00:02:49.739> I

you're going to make a change in life

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.300 
you're going to make a change in life
you're<00:02:58.409> going<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.620> set<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> goal<00:02:58.980> you're<00:02:59.189> going

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you're going to set a goal you're going

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.339 
you're going to set a goal you're going
to<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.459> something<00:02:59.730> new<00:03:00.209> or<00:03:00.359> unique<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
to do something new or unique and you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.190 
to do something new or unique and you
fail<00:03:01.769> more<00:03:02.549> times<00:03:02.819> than<00:03:02.969> you<00:03:03.090> succeed<00:03:03.510> what

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
fail more times than you succeed what

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
fail more times than you succeed what
happens<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:05.099> gets<00:03:05.280> failure<00:03:05.819> gets

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
happens is that it gets failure gets

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.089 
happens is that it gets failure gets
reinforced<00:03:06.719> over<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.200> over<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.530> often<00:03:07.769> tell

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
reinforced over and over so I often tell

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.149
