00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
created afterwards was this bespoke

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.530 
created afterwards was this bespoke
Recovery's<00:01:08.250> longer<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.210> really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Recovery's longer that no one really

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
Recovery's longer that no one really

after matches and after training if the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.010 
after matches and after training if the
importance<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> nutrition<00:01:15.179> is<00:01:15.630> massive

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
importance of nutrition is massive

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
importance of nutrition is massive
because<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.190> only<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.940> only

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
because you can only you can only

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
because you can only you can only
produce<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.660> what<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> feel<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.770> the

produce is what you feel and that's the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
produce is what you feel and that's the
way<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.160> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.429> handle<00:01:20.670> things<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
way we kind of handle things here at the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
way we kind of handle things here at the
club<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.929> to<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.110> sure<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.289> before

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
club is we want to make sure that before

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
club is we want to make sure that before
we<00:01:23.310> train<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.450> feel<00:01:24.690> them<00:01:24.929> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> point

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
we train we we feel them to the point

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.139 
we train we we feel them to the point
where<00:01:25.500> they<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.800> perform<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.310> during

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
where they can perform where during

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.430 
where they can perform where during
training<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> feel<00:01:28.080> them<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.350> they

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
training we want to feel them so they

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.810 
training we want to feel them so they
can<00:01:28.470> maintain<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.950> high<00:01:29.130> performance<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> then

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can maintain a high performance and then

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.639 
can maintain a high performance and then
after<00:01:30.090> training<00:01:30.300> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> give<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
after training you want to give them the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.020 
after training you want to give them the
proper<00:01:31.890> supplements<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.580> make<00:01:32.729> sure<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
proper supplements to make sure that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
proper supplements to make sure that
they<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.300> recover<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> protein<00:01:34.380> works

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
they can recover and the protein works

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.340 
they can recover and the protein works
up<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.800> this<00:01:34.979> point<00:01:35.190> has<00:01:35.399> provided<00:01:35.670> us<00:01:35.880> with

little glimpse of how the Gavin Boyes do
it<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.370> end<00:02:54.580> that's<00:02:54.700> kind<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.600> what<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it in the end that's kind of what you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750 
it in the end that's kind of what you
strive<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.380> do<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.650> learn<00:02:56.860> from<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.640> people

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
strive to do is learn from what people

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.910 
strive to do is learn from what people
at<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.090> top<00:02:58.270> level<00:02:58.300> are<00:02:58.690> doing<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.110> then<00:02:59.200> try<00:02:59.890> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
at a top level are doing and then try to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.380 
at a top level are doing and then try to
apply<00:03:00.250> them<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.490> what<00:03:00.730> you're<00:03:00.910> doing<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.270> way

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
apply them to what you're doing in a way

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.030 
apply them to what you're doing in a way
that<00:03:01.570> pnina<00:03:01.990> makes<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.410> activities<00:03:02.830> more

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that pnina makes your activities more

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
that pnina makes your activities more
effective<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.880> think<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.840> will<00:03:05.080> take

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
effective so I think that we will take

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.300 
effective so I think that we will take
it<00:03:05.350> away<00:03:05.440> indefinitely<00:03:05.800> going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> put

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
it away indefinitely going to put

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.080 
it away indefinitely going to put
furniture

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.150 

Oh
