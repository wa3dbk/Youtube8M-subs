patent leather the reason why it has

patent leather the reason why it has
this<00:02:56.939> high<00:02:57.120> shine<00:02:57.389> is<00:02:57.689> it's<00:02:57.989> actually<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
this high shine is it's actually a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.550 
this high shine is it's actually a
leather<00:02:58.739> with<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.400> coating<00:03:00.389> on<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> PV<00:03:01.379> U

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.559

or<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> plastic<00:03:02.189> coating<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.819> very<00:03:03.150> thin<00:03:03.389> layer

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
or a plastic coating a very thin layer

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.629 
or a plastic coating a very thin layer
so<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:04.319> will<00:03:04.530> take<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.829> coating<00:03:05.189> off<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
so that will take the coating off if it

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.809 
so that will take the coating off if it
has<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:05.909> acetone<00:03:06.329> in<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:07.189> then<00:03:08.189> once<00:03:08.579> you've

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
has an acetone in it then once you've

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.409 
has an acetone in it then once you've
done<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.260> all<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:11.370> need<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.819> basically

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
done that all you need to do basically

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.800 
done that all you need to do basically

there's<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.689> couple<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.019> things<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.379> strongly

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
there's a couple of things I strongly

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.759 
there's a couple of things I strongly
recommend<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.370> find<00:03:51.090> these<00:03:51.780> are<00:03:52.139> an<00:03:52.319> absolute

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769

godsend they're called a food tree what
they<00:03:56.009> do<00:03:56.069> is<00:03:56.519> they<00:03:56.729> will<00:03:56.879> stretch<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.329> shoe

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
they do is they will stretch the shoe

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.379 
they do is they will stretch the shoe

tendency to crack when you've worn it
too<00:04:02.729> much<00:04:02.909> this<00:04:03.720> will<00:04:03.930> help<00:04:04.169> to<00:04:04.379> stretch<00:04:04.739> it

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
too much this will help to stretch it

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:05.719 
too much this will help to stretch it
into<00:04:05.069> shape
