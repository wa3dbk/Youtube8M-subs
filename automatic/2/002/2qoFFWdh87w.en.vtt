00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
fabrics to be making stuff so I thought

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.110 
fabrics to be making stuff so I thought
to<00:03:09.959> myself<00:03:10.110> home<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.220> where<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.550> fabrics<00:03:11.940> come

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
to myself home is where the fabrics come

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.910 
to myself home is where the fabrics come
from<00:03:12.360> why<00:03:12.630> don't<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.870> come<00:03:13.050> home<00:03:13.170> labor<00:03:13.650> will<00:03:13.830> be

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
from why don't I come home labor will be

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.100 
from why don't I come home labor will be
cheaper<00:03:14.250> I'll<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.239> source<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.570> firebreaks

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
for the pool and so that's how I got

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.870 
for the pool and so that's how I got
into<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:50.070> course<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.489> had<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.760> do<00:03:50.850> a

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
into that and of course I had to do a

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.039 
into that and of course I had to do a
lot<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.060> research<00:03:51.980> into<00:03:53.329> making<00:03:54.329> African

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
lot of research into making African

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.280 
lot of research into making African
print<00:03:55.290> swimwear<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:56.130> know<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:57.079> it's<00:03:58.079> been

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
print swimwear you know and it's been

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
print swimwear you know and it's been
fun

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.559 

some<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> difficulties<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.180> making

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
some of the difficulties and making

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.229 
some of the difficulties and making
African<00:04:05.870> print<00:04:06.050> swimwear<00:04:06.349> I<00:04:06.410> would<00:04:06.620> say<00:04:07.239> the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
African print swimwear I would say the

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.449 
African print swimwear I would say the
fact<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.930> African<00:04:09.709> princess<00:04:10.069> cuts<00:04:10.340> in

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
fact that the African princess cuts in

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.670 
fact that the African princess cuts in
its<00:04:10.730> non-stretch<00:04:11.330> makes<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.470> little

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
its non-stretch makes it a little

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.259 
its non-stretch makes it a little
difficult<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.310> course<00:04:13.370> in<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.760> beginning<00:04:13.849> it

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
difficult of course in the beginning it

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.940 
difficult of course in the beginning it
was<00:04:14.360> difficult<00:04:14.599> but<00:04:14.900> now<00:04:15.050> we've<00:04:15.260> gotten<00:04:15.920> a

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
was difficult but now we've gotten a

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.530 
was difficult but now we've gotten a
good<00:04:16.340> grasp<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.239> not<00:04:17.359> as

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
good grasp of it so it's not as

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.800 
good grasp of it so it's not as
difficult<00:04:17.870> anymore<00:04:18.350> but<00:04:18.590> I'd<00:04:18.979> say<00:04:19.220> it's<00:04:19.810> we've

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
difficult anymore but I'd say it's we've

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.370 
difficult anymore but I'd say it's we've
grown<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.380> lot<00:04:21.760> we've<00:04:22.780> learned<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.960> lot<00:04:23.990> of

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
grown a lot we've learned a lot of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.540 
grown a lot we've learned a lot of
course<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.949> experience<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.460> best

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
course the experience is the best

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.659 
course the experience is the best
teacher<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.660> having<00:04:26.990> done<00:04:27.800> all<00:04:28.160> these<00:04:28.430> years

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
teacher so having done all these years

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
haven't made a number of pieces if you

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.110 
haven't made a number of pieces if you
look<00:04:30.710> at<00:04:30.830> our<00:04:30.949> old<00:04:31.160> pieces<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.729> we<00:04:31.820> started

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
look at our old pieces that we started

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.690 
look at our old pieces that we started
with<00:04:32.710> compared<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.889> what<00:04:34.130> we<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.430> now

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
you could tell the difference that it's

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.790 
you could tell the difference that it's
definitely<00:04:36.979> grown<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> lot<00:04:37.729> we've<00:04:38.620> improved<00:04:39.620> on

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
definitely grown a lot we've improved on

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.290

a<00:04:39.889> lot<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.160> things<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.639> we've<00:04:40.760> improved<00:04:41.120> on

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
a lot of things that we've improved on

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.840 
a lot of things that we've improved on
our<00:04:41.389> cuts<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.050> food<00:04:42.320> on<00:04:42.500> our<00:04:42.650> designs<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
our cuts to the food on our designs and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.900 
our cuts to the food on our designs and
who's<00:04:44.030> gonna<00:04:44.470> stitching<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.860> other<00:04:46.520> things

being my mentor advised me that the best
thing<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.760> could<00:05:34.880> do<00:05:34.970> for<00:05:35.000> yourself<00:05:35.389> is<00:05:35.450> own

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
thing you could do for yourself is own

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.100 
thing you could do for yourself is own
your<00:05:35.780> store<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:37.460> stopped<00:05:38.000> investing<00:05:38.690> my

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
your store so I stopped investing my

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620
