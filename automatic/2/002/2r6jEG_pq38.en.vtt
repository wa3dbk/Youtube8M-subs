 I'm not hitting the new call is fluffy swimming 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:40.649
 It is driving a tar-clack amount of three blue rocks shot 2 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 God, look after me and my second eye. 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:51.360
 5 4 Let God's love be a lot of days 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 I searched for the high sky and prayed for the light. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.600
 And the sky is very wide and high.

 They all resemble God's love. 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.300
 Because I think of the God of Rock 3, my breasts have become more and more swollen 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.600
 God's love is amazing 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.880

 A lot of stars are sparkling about things. 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.450
 Holes on the nose 4 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.689

 You're seeing your daughter. 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:26.909
 Darkness makes sense, even God with a heart hasini later at night 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.370
 God's grace shines more than the stars. 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:35.250
