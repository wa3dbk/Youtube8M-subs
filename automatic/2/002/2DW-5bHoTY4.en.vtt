00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the country because the and and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
the country because the and and
ultimately<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.670> some<00:01:02.940> ways<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.449> good

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
ultimately in some ways it was a good

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469 
ultimately in some ways it was a good
thing<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.960> yeah<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.290> understand<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.479> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
thing and yeah we understand that that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.320 
thing and yeah we understand that that
was<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.619> putting<00:01:07.979> 36<00:01:08.580> spoke<00:01:08.790> wheels<00:01:09.060> and

was<00:01:11.400> brutal<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> frames<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> outgrowth

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
was brutal on frames then the outgrowth

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.109 
was brutal on frames then the outgrowth
of<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.970> bike<00:01:16.610> ultimately<00:01:17.610> became<00:01:18.060> the
