hey<00:00:01.850> youtube<00:00:02.239> I<00:00:02.360> just<00:00:02.389> wanted<00:00:02.779> to<00:00:02.840> make<00:00:02.959> a

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:02.989 
hey youtube I just wanted to make a

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.410 
hey youtube I just wanted to make a
short<00:00:03.259> video<00:00:03.469> here<00:00:03.949> explaining<00:00:04.490> my<00:00:04.760> idea<00:00:05.150> that

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
short video here explaining my idea that

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
short video here explaining my idea that
I<00:00:05.450> had<00:00:05.870> about<00:00:06.700> different<00:00:07.700> ways<00:00:07.730> of<00:00:08.440> rolling

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
I had about different ways of rolling

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.999 
I had about different ways of rolling
sheet<00:00:09.860> metal<00:00:10.219> into<00:00:10.459> cylinders<00:00:11.889> instead<00:00:12.889> of

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
sheet metal into cylinders instead of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.330 
sheet metal into cylinders instead of
using<00:00:13.190> expensive<00:00:13.879> heavy<00:00:14.059> machinery<00:00:15.250> you<00:00:16.250> know

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
using expensive heavy machinery you know

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.130 
using expensive heavy machinery you know
that<00:00:16.550> most<00:00:16.730> people<00:00:16.820> don't<00:00:17.150> have<00:00:17.270> access<00:00:17.420> to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.850 

basically<00:00:21.140> my<00:00:21.440> idea<00:00:21.470> entails<00:00:22.280> finding<00:00:23.000> a<00:00:23.150> pull

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
basically my idea entails finding a pull

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.710 
basically my idea entails finding a pull
pipe<00:00:24.860> or<00:00:25.070> some<00:00:25.280> other<00:00:25.400> strong<00:00:26.560> form<00:00:28.720> first

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
pipe or some other strong form first

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.150 
pipe or some other strong form first
most<00:00:30.080> it<00:00:30.289> has<00:00:30.350> to<00:00:30.880> it<00:00:31.880> has<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.240> match<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.320> exact

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
most it has to it has to match the exact

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.060 
most it has to it has to match the exact
circumference<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.329> your<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:36.440> length<00:00:36.680> of<00:00:36.950> your

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
circumference of your the length of your

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.880 
circumference of your the length of your
sheet<00:00:37.280> metal<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.260> have<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.560> piece<00:00:39.770> of

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
sheet metal and I have this piece of

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.370 
sheet metal and I have this piece of
paper<00:00:40.070> here<00:00:40.340> representing<00:00:41.060> what<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.780> sheet

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
paper here representing what the sheet

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.370 
paper here representing what the sheet
metal<00:00:42.530> piece<00:00:42.860> would<00:00:43.130> be<00:00:43.310> doing<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.079> beer

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
metal piece would be doing and this beer

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.460 
metal piece would be doing and this beer
bottle<00:00:45.530> being<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.280> poll<00:00:46.520> or<00:00:46.850> other<00:00:47.380> form<00:00:48.380> that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
bottle being the poll or other form that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.729 
bottle being the poll or other form that
you<00:00:48.710> could<00:00:48.890> find<00:00:49.450> so<00:00:50.450> basically<00:00:50.899> my<00:00:51.230> idea<00:00:51.260> is

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
you could find so basically my idea is

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.540 
you could find so basically my idea is
is<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:54.040> place<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.309> sheet<00:00:55.520> metal<00:00:55.730> around

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
is to place the sheet metal around

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.799 
is to place the sheet metal around
around<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.670> pole<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:01.160> then<00:01:01.510> bending<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.660> as

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
around the pole and then bending it as

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.860 
around the pole and then bending it as
much<00:01:03.020> as<00:01:03.170> possible<00:01:03.350> by<00:01:03.800> hand<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:05.690> when

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
much as possible by hand and then when

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.360 
much as possible by hand and then when
it<00:01:05.960> comes<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.380> point<00:01:06.590> where<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:06.920> can't<00:01:07.190> do

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
it comes to the point where you can't do

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.810 
it comes to the point where you can't do
it<00:01:07.490> any<00:01:07.640> longer<00:01:09.520> bring<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.670> ratcheting<00:01:11.270> straps

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
it any longer bring in ratcheting straps

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.350 
it any longer bring in ratcheting straps
and<00:01:13.820> I'm<00:01:14.360> going<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.600> use<00:01:14.810> this<00:01:16.030> headphone<00:01:17.030> wire

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
and I'm going to use this headphone wire

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.850 
and I'm going to use this headphone wire
here<00:01:17.840> as<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.049> as<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:19.280> ratcheting<00:01:20.030> strap

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
here as a as a ratcheting strap

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.640 
here as a as a ratcheting strap
representation<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:23.720> let's<00:01:23.930> see<00:01:24.170> what<00:01:24.470> would

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
representation so let's see what would

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.300 
representation so let's see what would
basically<00:01:25.610> my<00:01:26.119> idea<00:01:26.479> would<00:01:26.690> be<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:28.750> have<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
basically my idea would be to have the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.840 
basically my idea would be to have the
ratcheting<00:01:31.310> strap<00:01:31.729> either<00:01:32.740> one<00:01:33.740> or<00:01:33.770> two<00:01:33.920> most

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
ratcheting strap either one or two most

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.760 
ratcheting strap either one or two most
likely<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.630> be<00:01:35.750> used<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.439> top<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
likely to will be used one on the top of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.490 
likely to will be used one on the top of
one<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.100> bottom

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
one on the bottom

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.390 
one on the bottom
but<00:01:39.500> basically<00:01:39.710> Ratchet<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.760> down<00:01:42.280> Ratchet<00:01:43.280> it

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
but basically Ratchet it down Ratchet it

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.280 
but basically Ratchet it down Ratchet it
until<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:46.460> two<00:01:46.700> ends<00:01:46.939> meet<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.540> when<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> two

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
until the two ends meet and when the two

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.219 
until the two ends meet and when the two
ends<00:01:48.500> meet<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.920> should<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:53.210> formed<00:01:53.960> piece

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
ends meet you should have a formed piece

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.740 
ends meet you should have a formed piece
of<00:01:54.409> metal<00:01:54.729> there<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.909> still<00:01:56.180> going<00:01:56.329> to<00:01:56.390> be<00:01:56.450> some

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
of metal there is still going to be some

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
of metal there is still going to be some
some<00:01:57.380> springiness<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:59.680> but<00:02:00.680> by<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.189> point

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.109 

most<00:02:05.670> likely<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.140> able<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.440> bend<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
most likely you would be able to bend it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.650 
most likely you would be able to bend it
by<00:02:09.119> hand<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:10.649> meet<00:02:10.890> together<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:12.300> order<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
by hand to meet together in order to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980 
by hand to meet together in order to
weld<00:02:12.960> it<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.920> looks<00:02:14.160> from<00:02:14.840> from<00:02:15.840> this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
weld it and it looks from from this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.990 
weld it and it looks from from this
little<00:02:16.170> mini<00:02:16.530> experiment<00:02:17.160> I'm<00:02:17.250> doing<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.820> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
little mini experiment I'm doing here it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800 
little mini experiment I'm doing here it
looks<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.950> ratcheting<00:02:20.580> strap<00:02:21.510> will

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
looks like the ratcheting strap will

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.980 
looks like the ratcheting strap will
have<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.350> ratcheted<00:02:22.920> from<00:02:23.360> exact<00:02:24.360> opposite

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
have to be ratcheted from exact opposite

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.680 
have to be ratcheted from exact opposite
side<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.650> where<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.430> two<00:02:26.910> ends<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> sheet

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
side of where the two ends of the sheet

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:37.120 
side of where the two ends of the sheet
metal<00:02:27.840> will<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:33.350> essentially<00:02:34.350> it's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.500 

wrapping<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.340> sheet<00:02:38.550> metal<00:02:38.730> around<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.270> pole

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
wrapping the sheet metal around the pole

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.199 
wrapping the sheet metal around the pole
and<00:02:42.230> pulling<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> together<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.790> that's<00:02:45.000> my

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and pulling it together so that's my

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.160 
and pulling it together so that's my
idea<00:02:46.280> comment<00:02:47.280> email<00:02:48.090> me<00:02:48.239> at<00:02:48.360> Ben<00:02:48.540> nephal<00:02:48.959> camp
