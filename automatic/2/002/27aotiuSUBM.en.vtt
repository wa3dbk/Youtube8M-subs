but<00:01:40.660> but<00:01:41.530> still<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:42.250> mean<00:01:42.429> that<00:01:42.550> you're<00:01:42.670> still<00:01:42.940> F

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
but but still I mean that you're still F

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.090 
but but still I mean that you're still F
of<00:01:43.210> H<00:01:43.390> because<00:01:43.869> they're<00:01:44.229> Jeremy<00:01:44.560> singing<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
of H because they're Jeremy singing and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.609 
of H because they're Jeremy singing and
early<00:01:45.429> singing<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:46.990> that's<00:01:47.319> always

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
early singing and so it's that's always

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.840 
early singing and so it's that's always
going<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.830> kind<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.100> sound<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.429> as<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.580> page

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
going to kind of sound like as a page

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.130 
going to kind of sound like as a page
still<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> lot<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.979> vocals<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.280> yeah<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.390> think

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
still a lot of vocals and yeah I think

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.699 
still a lot of vocals and yeah I think
it's<00:01:53.289> more<00:01:54.060> vulnerable<00:01:55.060> lyrics<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.750> more

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
it's more vulnerable lyrics so more

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:14.340 
it's more vulnerable lyrics so more
personal

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.040 

and<00:02:14.470> if<00:02:14.860> I
