00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.300
 hello everyone I'm dan and I'm here 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.670
 new in minecraft good no no 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.230
 I'm exactly on my desk and that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.150
 it's because this is the special thousand 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.950
 subscribers in this video I'm going to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.869
 show what program I use to record and 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.760
 edit the videos and also the program 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.440
 I use to make textures and other 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.360
 finally I will show you in the new 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.370
 facebook page of the channel that many 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.550
 you have asked me to do so 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.800
 let's start let's start watching the program 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.470
 what I use to record my videos is called 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 fraps and many already know him is the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.379
 only that tested and therefore not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.600
 I can compare it with others but you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.370
 I assure that it works quite well is a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.440
 very simple and very simple program 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.239
 use but it's tremendously powerful is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.560
 able to record both desktops and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.270
 windows with impressive quality 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.010
 the only problem that this has 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.860
 program is that the videos that generates 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.900
 they occupy a lot as you see if a 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.600
 video of only thirty seconds occupies 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.730
 a gig so imagine a video of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.760
 about ten minutes it would take more or less 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.680
 about 20 gigas that the quality of the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.060
 video is awesome if I open it and what 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.010
 I put full screen will appear 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.900
 entirely that I am at my desk 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.160
 although now how am I recording the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.870
 video is very slow 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.450
 if I was not recording I assure you that 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
 Perfectly it looks like already mentioned 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.960
 before the videos that this generates 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490
 program weighs a lot and therefore 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 can not be uploaded as is to youtube 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.430
 so we will have to use a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.220
 editing program to be able 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.260
 render the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.940
 the program that I use is called sony 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.590
 vegas and like FRAP this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.080
 program is well known and is the one that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.700
 they use the majority of the youtubers is a 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.830
 very powerful program and with it you can 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.030
 do impressive things and although at 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.950
 principle costs a bit since the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.510
 program is quite complex after 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.270
 some time and you start to get the hang of it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.680
 and to take full advantage of the problem 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.480
 he sees this program is that it takes 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.100
 very much in rent to raise although that 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.650
 depends to a large extent on the computer that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.630
 have each truth and nothing that 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.730
 the program is quite good and without 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.320
 I certainly advise you if you make videos and 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.530
 if you have clear windows because this 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.760
 program unfortunately is not for mac 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.040
 let's go now to see the program that he uses 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.950
 to edit photographs and make textures 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.540
 and it's called fireworks and it's a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.209
 editor like photoshop images 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.620
 but much more simple to use with 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.720
 this program is with which I do the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.160
 textures of the mods and others and also 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.020
 other things like for example the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 photos you used on the island minecraft news 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.920
 as I say it is a very simple program 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.380
 to use and you will find many 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.420
 tutorials on the internet 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.610
 finally we will see the new page 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.350
 of the channel that you have already created 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.030
 that many of you had asked me and here 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.860
 is the truth that is very cool and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.320
 thanks to it we can communicate 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.910
 rather better than until now as you see 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.410
 is linked with my twitter what 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 means that everything you write in 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.100
 twitter will appear here you can comment 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.660
 my twitter comments worth the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.300
 redundancy and be aware of the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.370
 latest news of the channel besides 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.140
 all of that I can ask the questions and 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.050
 surveys like this that you are seeing 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.430
 which is an example I can ask you 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.200
 example that seems to you in certain 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.190
 sections of the channel that mod you want that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.810
 do the next day or things like that 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.820
 finally up here you have some 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.920
 how many buttons is one linked to my 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.420
 twitter and another with the youtube channel and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.890
 the last one brings you a page with a 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.960
 small form by which 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.460
 You can contact me 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.140
 please I ask that you only use it for 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.510
 important things since it is linked 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.640
 directly with my mail 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.500
 the page is called channel and if the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.150
 minecraft and you will have the link in the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.620
 description of the video along with the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.209
 twitter 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.010
 Finally, tell me that I am going to change 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.569
 of computer within very little and not 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.849
 only from computer but also from 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.290
 operating system effectively my new 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.030
 computer is going to be a mac and therefore 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.159
 I'll take a little while to get used to it 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.690
 to him this means that maybe some 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.040
 do not upload video because it's 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.569
 configuring the new computer or 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.400
 looking for recording programs or 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.900
 anything anyway 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.329
 will report everything by twitter and by 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.280
 facebook then just thank you very much 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.849
 all for following me greetings and even the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.849
 next video
