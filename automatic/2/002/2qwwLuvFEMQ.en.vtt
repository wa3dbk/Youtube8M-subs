00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.940
 hello I am I did michael I 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
 am a consultant in layout and 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.050
 apartment decor and today 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.420
 I will tell you about storage in 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.220
 a very small space then for example 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.189
 here we opted for a storage 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:22.029
 on a side wall so as to 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.420
 maximize a surface that is 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.420
 on the side and that normally is not 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.449
 used so we will take a closet 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.040
 fitted out and even integrated a bed 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.449
 retractable for visitors 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.260
 casual 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:41.170
 for example here we will use this little 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 nook this angle to make a closet 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.699
 in angle and make the most of the space 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.549
 to store personal laundry 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.479
 in the bathroom for example we 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.970
 opted for a vertical pharmacy 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.339
 with mirrored walls one can get 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.619
 see foot instead of taking a 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.690
 pharmacy that will take width 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.969
 here on the volume here we will put 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.399
 just a bright mirror and this 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.770
 swivel vertical pharmacy is going 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.259
 allow to store all the little ones 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.390
 toilet utensils very 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.170
 effective and will take a lot less of 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.789
 place that a shelf here above 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.070
 the sink as we used to see 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.359
 what is good in the apartments 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.159
 is that sometimes there are 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.500
 little surprises and in this case here 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.799
 there is a small recess and we are going 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.780
 use it to put a closed shelf 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.189
 with a window that will allow to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.289
 put away all towels 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.630
 even in the tests one can use a 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.119
 small space in the event above 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.979
 the tank is a small closet space for 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.450
 put all the cleaning products 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.219
 does not take up too much space and it's very 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.499
 effective also we have early at hand 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.130
 so at each piece we will find a 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.870
 small space to exploit to store 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 equipment 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.040
 adding products here are some 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.690
 little tips to recover from 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.380
 the space to make storage in 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 a small studio 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 and
