don't I sleep like a baby when it comes
to<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:40.010> stuff<00:00:40.220> this<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:40.820> not<00:00:40.940> my<00:00:41.000> money<00:00:41.300> but

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
to that stuff this is not my money but

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.260 
to that stuff this is not my money but
uh<00:00:42.230> but<00:00:42.740> it<00:00:42.860> is<00:00:42.950> my<00:00:43.100> career<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.090> thing<00:00:44.240> that

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
uh but it is my career so the thing that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.420 
uh but it is my career so the thing that
I<00:00:44.450> lost<00:00:44.630> sleep<00:00:44.870> over<00:00:45.050> was<00:00:45.470> if<00:00:45.830> we<00:00:46.010> made<00:00:46.220> this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
I lost sleep over was if we made this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.650 
I lost sleep over was if we made this
film<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:48.020> was<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> piece<00:00:48.410> of<00:00:48.440> crap<00:00:48.680> if<00:00:49.660> it

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
film and it was a piece of crap if it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.260 
film and it was a piece of crap if it
made<00:00:51.080> money<00:00:51.410> they<00:00:51.920> would<00:00:52.160> be<00:00:52.460> successful<00:00:53.090> but

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
made money they would be successful but

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.510 
made money they would be successful but
it<00:00:53.420> could<00:00:53.600> really<00:00:53.810> hurt<00:00:54.620> my<00:00:54.890> bruised<00:00:55.310> my<00:00:55.490> ego

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
it could really hurt my bruised my ego

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960 
it could really hurt my bruised my ego
and<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.510> think<00:00:56.960> ultimately<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:58.490> it<00:00:58.790> ends

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
and I think ultimately I think it ends

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.580 
and I think ultimately I think it ends
up<00:00:59.060> hurting<00:00:59.240> a<00:00:59.360> filmmakers<00:00:59.840> career<00:01:00.230> if<00:01:00.410> they

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
up hurting a filmmakers career if they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.440 
up hurting a filmmakers career if they
make<00:01:00.800> movies<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.340> aren't<00:01:01.550> good<00:01:01.880> even<00:01:02.360> if

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
make movies that aren't good even if

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.810 
make movies that aren't good even if
they're<00:01:02.570> successful<00:01:02.750> at<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.170> box<00:01:03.230> office

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
they're successful at the box office

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.910 
they're successful at the box office
I've<00:01:04.820> been<00:01:05.239> spoiled<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.229> past<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.799> that

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
I've been spoiled in the past and that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.760 
I've been spoiled in the past and that
the<00:01:07.070> movies<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.430> I've<00:01:07.700> made<00:01:08.530> have<00:01:09.530> always

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
the movies that I've made have always

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.070 
the movies that I've made have always
been<00:01:09.890> well<00:01:10.100> received<00:01:10.600> although<00:01:11.600> some<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:11.930> them

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
been well received although some of them

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.810 
been well received although some of them
like<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.410> last<00:01:12.620> ones<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.070> there<00:01:13.250> are<00:01:13.430> bombs

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
like the last ones that there are bombs

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.410 
like the last ones that there are bombs
pretty<00:01:14.360> hard<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:16.640> idea<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:17.000> making<00:01:17.180> a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
pretty hard so the idea of making a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.940 
pretty hard so the idea of making a
movie<00:01:17.720> as<00:01:17.810> i<00:01:17.930> was<00:01:18.050> talking<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.350> Robert<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:18.770> said

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
movie as i was talking to Robert I said

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.080 
movie as i was talking to Robert I said
what<00:01:19.070> do<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.190> want<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:19.490> with<00:01:19.610> your<00:01:19.670> career

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
what do you want to do with your career

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.430 
what do you want to do with your career
and<00:01:20.180> he's<00:01:20.300> like<00:01:20.450> I'd<00:01:20.630> like<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.930> make<00:01:21.110> good

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
and he's like I'd like to make good

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.230 
and he's like I'd like to make good
movies<00:01:21.620> that<00:01:21.890> people<00:01:22.070> actually<00:01:22.490> get<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.850> see

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
movies that people actually get to see

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.080 
movies that people actually get to see
and<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:24.770> becomes<00:01:25.130> compelling<00:01:25.760> after<00:01:26.060> a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
and that becomes compelling after a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.960 
and that becomes compelling after a
while<00:01:26.300> so<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.409> pressure<00:01:27.680> wasn't<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:28.370> much<00:01:28.550> to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
while so the pressure wasn't so much to

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.690 
while so the pressure wasn't so much to
make<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.690> movie<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:31.040> stood<00:01:31.310> up<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
make a movie that that stood up to the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
make a movie that that stood up to the
genre<00:01:32.090> because<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.390> genre<00:01:32.780> honestly<00:01:33.229> has<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
genre because the genre honestly has a

Chaplin this is a very big jump for him

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.590 
Chaplin this is a very big jump for him
so<00:03:30.290> he<00:03:30.500> was<00:03:31.190> training<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.640> lot<00:03:31.760> he's<00:03:32.090> he<00:03:32.390> does

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
I was getting ready for the movie I know

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.340 
I was getting ready for the movie I know
we<00:03:40.760> were<00:03:40.880> buzzword<00:03:41.390> or<00:03:41.720> your<00:03:41.840> kind<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.079> battle

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
we were buzzword or your kind of battle

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.170 
we were buzzword or your kind of battle
cry<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.769> was<00:03:42.920> plausibility<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.609> we<00:03:43.880> had<00:03:44.000> some

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
cry it was plausibility that we had some

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.310 
cry it was plausibility that we had some
awards<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.480> wanted<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.750> make<00:03:44.840> sure<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.109> this

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
awards you wanted to make sure that this

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.229 
awards you wanted to make sure that this
was<00:03:45.470> kind<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.040> felt<00:03:46.280> plausible<00:03:46.730> but<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.000> don't

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
was kind of felt plausible but I don't

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.310 
was kind of felt plausible but I don't
know<00:03:47.299> what<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.420> was<00:03:47.510> kind<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.900> took<00:03:48.049> because

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
know what that was kind of took because

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.539 
know what that was kind of took because
you<00:03:48.380> are<00:03:48.500> obviously<00:03:48.709> dealing<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.130> superhero

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
well plus it the idea plausibility is is

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
permission it's bad storytelling and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.000 
permission it's bad storytelling and
then<00:04:26.720> when<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:26.990> came<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.349> special<00:04:27.710> effects

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
then when it came to the special effects

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.200 
then when it came to the special effects
i've<00:04:28.159> always<00:04:28.430> been<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.640> real

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
i've always been a real

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.170 
i've always been a real
epic<00:04:29.479> about<00:04:29.690> CGI<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.280> always<00:04:31.759> wanted

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
epic about CGI so I always wanted

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.090 
epic about CGI so I always wanted
everything<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.690> look<00:04:32.840> real<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:33.319> operate<00:04:33.979> as

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
everything to look real and operate as

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.499 
everything to look real and operate as
though<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.340> was<00:04:34.460> real<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.000> everything<00:04:35.360> to

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
though it was real and everything to

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.170 
though it was real and everything to
make<00:04:35.690> sense<00:04:35.990> because<00:04:36.979> I<00:04:37.280> feel<00:04:37.699> that<00:04:37.729> if<00:04:38.060> the

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
make sense because I feel that if the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.850 
make sense because I feel that if the
CGI<00:04:38.599> are<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.870> effects<00:04:39.199> are<00:04:39.349> too<00:04:39.470> over<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.770> top

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
CGI are the effects are too over the top

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.520 
CGI are the effects are too over the top
and<00:04:40.280> too<00:04:40.430> crazy<00:04:40.759> you<00:04:41.090> lose<00:04:41.900> your<00:04:42.110> emotional

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
and too crazy you lose your emotional

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.080 
and too crazy you lose your emotional
connection<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.250> lead<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.699> always<00:04:43.849> felt

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
connection to the lead and I always felt

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.520 
connection to the lead and I always felt
that<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.419> strongest<00:04:44.630> who<00:04:45.020> do<00:04:45.169> this<00:04:45.289> was

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
that the strongest who do this was

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.200 
that the strongest who do this was
Robert<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.009> his<00:04:46.039> betrayal<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.610> Tony<00:04:46.849> Stark

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
Robert and his betrayal of Tony Stark
