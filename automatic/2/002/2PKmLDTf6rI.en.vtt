00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.530
 a gift for you that is not 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.889
 justly 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.889
 a former friend 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.920
 it's called vanesa carbone already put between 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.830
 other things 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.230
 of being one that sold it with information 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 the press is not informed 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.860
 if she sat down in some program like 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 here as in other programs to count already 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:43.470
 say I traveled with vanessa to be done 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.900
 I charge her with everyone but there's a moment 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.250
 of my life maybe I was surrounded by 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.970
 many people that at that time 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.739
 I felt betrayed and I felt that I did not 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.890
 They knew how to care as a person who was 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.690
 next door and at that time there were two 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 people who betrayed and sold me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.809
 information of the relationship not much in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.809
 his voice 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:22.050
 I do not know what he was referring to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.500
 because I with vanessa he never had 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:30.500
 in relation to see if it's true 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.060
 because nothing because she is no longer a woman 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.680
 that is usually climbers that every place 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 why do they double yes because they like it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.930
 the now let's talk all 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.570
 and you well know that the work in the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:58.050
 that we had with the buses dying 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:59.970
 I went through this with the product and because 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.410
 the metric producer that they were because 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.930
 with me nothing happened because I was on 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.510
 girlfriend and very well in faith 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.420
 like me with him 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.700
 he was with her she started 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.620
 get out the ones that go the most and the squire 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.990
 you can also tell us he sent us to take out 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.820
 the feathers we all whip a place 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.010
 in the marquee had a greeting place 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.440
 if it seems it started to be started 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.210
 make me create the production the pens 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.100
 He also ordered him to bring out the brightness to me 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.080
 he sent me to take out the feathers are fish 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.370
 waving up on him is finished by the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.860
 blame that saved by the dancer 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
 sweeping the floor if to me it is climbing 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.230
 this partner is like a bad partner 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.180
 and never leave it and cause that's why it gives me 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.370
 quarrel because I do not know what thing I do not know 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.530
 absolutely nothing about her and in that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.120
 summer nobody found out about anything and I the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.120
 I passed very badly and how it was 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.430

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.740
 where they went in the same theater 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.990

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.150

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.459
 even when Alvaro was hit and is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.680
 towards what he wanted how he feels and so 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.530
 I'm going to tell the producer and battaglia 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 the stage is what I wanted and I was joking 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.200

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.819

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.120
