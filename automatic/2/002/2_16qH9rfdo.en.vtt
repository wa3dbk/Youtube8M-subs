I<00:00:19.670> want<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> light<00:00:21.119> source<00:00:21.420> that's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
I want to know the light source that's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400 
I want to know the light source that's
just<00:00:22.439> barely<00:00:22.619> lighter<00:00:22.949> than<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.310> show<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> I'm

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
just barely lighter than my show and I'm

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
just barely lighter than my show and I'm
going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> blue<00:00:26.430> because

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
going to make it kind of blue because

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.390 
going to make it kind of blue because
what<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:28.349> blue<00:00:28.710> sky

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
what it is this blue sky

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
what it is this blue sky
that's<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.240> indirectly<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.170> hitting

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that's just indirectly just hitting

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.490 
that's just indirectly just hitting
everything<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.809> area<00:00:34.079> since<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
everything and this area since it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
everything and this area since it
doesn't<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> bright<00:00:35.280> light<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.550> it's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
doesn't have the bright light on it's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.330 
doesn't have the bright light on it's
just<00:00:36.149> getting<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.540> indirect<00:00:37.050> light<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.070> Luke

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.180 

and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> mix<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> blue<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and I have to mix the blue with the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
and I have to mix the blue with the
shadow<00:00:44.460> color<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> red<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
shadow color which was the red and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.230 
shadow color which was the red and
yellow<00:00:51.410> just<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.530> this

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
yellow just like this

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:02.370 
yellow just like this
then<00:00:55.240> at<00:00:55.510> white<00:01:00.840> okay<00:01:01.840> that<00:01:02.020> looks<00:01:02.140> like<00:01:02.320> a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
then at white okay that looks like a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.210 
then at white okay that looks like a
pretty<00:01:02.620> good<00:01:02.800> color<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.130> me<00:01:03.310> let's<00:01:03.490> test<00:01:03.730> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
pretty good color to me let's test it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.280 
pretty good color to me let's test it
talk<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.250> little<00:01:06.730> bit<00:01:06.880> more<00:01:06.910> blue<00:01:12.990> okay<00:01:13.990> same

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
talk a little bit more blue okay same

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.960 
talk a little bit more blue okay same
thing<00:01:14.500> on<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.710> side

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.010 

tight<00:01:20.630> little<00:01:21.190> texture<00:01:22.190> marks<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:26.780> want<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
tight little texture marks you want it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.450 
tight little texture marks you want it
to<00:01:27.110> go<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.620> way<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.920> very<00:01:28.040> edge<00:01:28.250> I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
to go all the way to the very edge I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.790 
to go all the way to the very edge I
need<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.730> go<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> little<00:01:28.970> lighter<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.800> it's

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
need to go a little lighter on this it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.160 
need to go a little lighter on this it's
not<00:01:30.980> quite<00:01:34.060> light<00:01:35.060> enough<00:01:35.360> compared<00:01:35.870> to<00:01:36.050> the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
not quite light enough compared to the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:56.050 
not quite light enough compared to the
shadow<00:01:40.060> like<00:01:41.060> this

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.340 

sometimes<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> wall<00:01:57.479> has<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.720> lot<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> texture

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
sometimes if a wall has a lot of texture

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.340 
sometimes if a wall has a lot of texture
on<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.070> use<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.900> just<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
on you can just use you can just use the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.020 
on you can just use you can just use the
texture<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.890> already<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.400> wall<00:02:02.549> like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
texture that's already on the wall like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:14.300 
texture that's already on the wall like
that<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:04.460> mixed<00:02:05.460> texture

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.800 

just<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.520> edge<00:02:15.850> that's<00:02:16.150> all<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.450> needs

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
just on that edge that's all it needs

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:35.190 
just on that edge that's all it needs
okay<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.980> little<00:02:18.610> more<00:02:18.790> here<00:02:20.490> little<00:02:21.490> up<00:02:21.640> here

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.520 

what<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.010> does<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.879> tells<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:38.260> tells

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
what this does is it tells just tells

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.589 
what this does is it tells just tells
you<00:02:38.650> visually<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.580> object<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.330> being

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
you visually that this object is being

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.650 
you visually that this object is being
affected<00:02:41.290> by<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.680> environment<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.300> color

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
affected by this environment this color

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.290 
affected by this environment this color
is<00:02:43.930> being<00:02:44.140> influenced<00:02:44.890> by<00:02:45.069> all<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:45.970> blue

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
is being influenced by all this blue

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.089 
is being influenced by all this blue
that<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.599> see<00:02:46.690> all<00:02:47.019> over<00:02:47.050> this<00:02:47.379> picture<00:02:47.920> and

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
that you see all over this picture and

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.449 
that you see all over this picture and
it<00:02:48.700> wraps<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:50.019> kind<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.620> envelops<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.280> in

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it wraps that it kind of envelops it in

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:03.390 
it wraps that it kind of envelops it in
the<00:02:51.819> picture

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.740 

I'd<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.760> see<00:03:04.909> this<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.209> blended<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
I'd like to see this get blended a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:25.690 
I'd like to see this get blended a
little<00:03:05.810> better<00:03:23.860> put<00:03:24.860> an<00:03:24.950> intermediate<00:03:25.160> color

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
little better put an intermediate color

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:52.440 
little better put an intermediate color
between<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.239> black<00:03:26.599> and<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.170> highlight

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.589 

now<00:03:53.450> there's<00:03:53.629> another<00:03:53.690> trick<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.290> can<00:03:54.440> do<00:03:55.599> the

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
now there's another trick you can do the

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.270 
now there's another trick you can do the
best<00:03:56.780> last<00:03:57.410> thing<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:58.300> can<00:03:59.300> get<00:03:59.480> straight<00:03:59.750> black

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
best last thing I can get straight black

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.770 
best last thing I can get straight black
and<00:04:01.810> I'll<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:03.550> on<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.610> canvas<00:04:04.970> I'll<00:04:05.599> just

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
and I'll just on the canvas I'll just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.199 
and I'll just on the canvas I'll just
get<00:04:05.959> these<00:04:06.140> my<00:04:06.860> brush<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.700> has<00:04:07.819> this<00:04:07.970> nice

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
get these my brush it has this nice

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.330 
get these my brush it has this nice
chiseled<00:04:08.780> tip<00:04:09.110> if<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.500> look<00:04:09.680> at<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.010> see<00:04:10.190> how

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
chiseled tip if you look at it see how

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.259 
chiseled tip if you look at it see how
that's<00:04:10.580> real<00:04:10.930> real<00:04:11.930> sharp<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:13.099> I'll<00:04:13.760> just<00:04:14.060> make

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
that's real real sharp so I'll just make

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.680 
that's real real sharp so I'll just make
straight<00:04:14.930> black<00:04:15.609> little<00:04:16.609> slits<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.450> deep

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
straight black little slits and the deep

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.320 
straight black little slits and the deep
parts<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.320> texture<00:04:19.540> just<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.750> shadows

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
parts of the texture just in the shadows

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.930 
parts of the texture just in the shadows
it'll<00:04:23.330> just<00:04:23.540> create<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.810> real<00:04:24.110> vivid<00:04:24.940> sharp

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
it'll just create a real vivid sharp

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.140 
it'll just create a real vivid sharp
shadow<00:04:26.419> effect<00:04:27.700> or<00:04:28.700> my<00:04:28.880> darkest<00:04:29.330> areas<00:04:29.720> are

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
shadow effect or my darkest areas are

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.900 
shadow effect or my darkest areas are
helps<00:04:32.150> make<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:32.479> tree<00:04:32.780> pop<00:04:33.080> forward<00:04:33.910> there's

helps make this tree pop forward there's
nothing<00:04:35.300> else<00:04:35.419> in<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> picture<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.139> has

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
nothing else in the picture that has

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
that dark that real dark shadow so

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.050 
that dark that real dark shadow so
things<00:04:42.979> don't<00:04:43.160> look<00:04:43.370> like<00:04:43.580> they're<00:04:43.820> at<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
things don't look like they're at the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.730 
things don't look like they're at the
same<00:04:44.270> depth<00:04:44.660> they're<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> same<00:04:45.139> layer<00:04:45.440> when

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
same depth they're the same layer when

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.860 
same depth they're the same layer when
the<00:04:45.860> colors<00:04:46.250> don't<00:04:46.490> match<00:04:46.729> up

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.530 

see<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.440> just<00:04:56.620> add<00:04:56.800> little<00:04:56.950> details<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:58.360> the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
see you just add little details on the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.230 
see you just add little details on the
video<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:59.220> have<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.250> how<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.550> paint<00:05:00.790> Leah's<00:05:01.000> video

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
video I have a how to paint Leah's video

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.310 
video I have a how to paint Leah's video
or<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.020> there's<00:05:02.620> like<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.800> tree<00:05:03.160> house<00:05:04.320> when

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
or that there's like a tree house when

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.680 
or that there's like a tree house when
we're<00:05:05.500> I'm<00:05:05.590> doing<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.920> big<00:05:06.100> oak<00:05:06.340> tree<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:07.030> used

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
we're I'm doing a big oak tree I used

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.590 
we're I'm doing a big oak tree I used
this<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:08.260> real<00:05:09.040> big<00:05:09.280> oak<00:05:09.550> tree<00:05:09.910> trunk<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.420> did

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
this a real big oak tree trunk I did

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.040 
this a real big oak tree trunk I did
this<00:05:10.780> same<00:05:11.110> thing<00:05:11.440> put<00:05:11.680> these<00:05:11.830> little<00:05:12.040> black

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
this same thing put these little black

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.910 
this same thing put these little black
patches<00:05:14.050> all<00:05:14.230> over<00:05:16.170> just<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.380> make<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.680> bark

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
patches all over just to make the bark

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.380 
patches all over just to make the bark
look<00:05:18.190> like<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.520> had<00:05:18.670> more<00:05:18.850> depth<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:23.520> so<00:05:24.520> this

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
look like it had more depth it so this

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.650 
look like it had more depth it so this
is<00:05:25.450> done<00:05:25.780> lessons<00:05:26.470> done<00:05:27.270> from<00:05:28.270> here<00:05:28.480> on<00:05:28.630> out

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
is done lessons done from here on out

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.630 
is done lessons done from here on out
I'm<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.320> being<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.620> perfectionist<00:05:30.010> just

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
I'm just being a perfectionist just

00:05:30.640 --> 00:06:18.820 
I'm just being a perfectionist just
messing<00:05:31.000> around

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.510 

yeah<00:06:19.460> it's<00:06:19.879> good<00:06:20.060> like<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.270> cheetah<00:06:23.020> so<00:06:24.020> I<00:06:24.520> can

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
yeah it's good like a cheetah so I can

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.420 
yeah it's good like a cheetah so I can
keep<00:06:25.639> going<00:06:25.789> and<00:06:26.030> add<00:06:26.599> a<00:06:26.629> lot<00:06:26.870> more<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.110> this

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
keep going and add a lot more to this

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.020 
keep going and add a lot more to this
probably<00:06:28.430> will<00:06:28.669> in<00:06:28.909> the<00:06:29.659> future<00:06:29.840> but<00:06:30.560> that<00:06:31.030> is

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
probably will in the future but that is

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.260 
probably will in the future but that is
the<00:06:32.150> principle<00:06:32.949> for<00:06:33.949> making<00:06:34.669> this<00:06:34.789> tree<00:06:35.000> trunk

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
the principle for making this tree trunk

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.629 
the principle for making this tree trunk
look<00:06:35.449> like<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:36.680> know<00:06:36.800> like<00:06:37.129> a<00:06:37.159> cylinder

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
look like you know like a cylinder

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.550 
look like you know like a cylinder
equals<00:06:38.090> shape<00:06:38.449> rather<00:06:38.750> than<00:06:39.050> just<00:06:39.229> a<00:06:39.319> flat

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
equals shape rather than just a flat

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.100 
equals shape rather than just a flat
layer<00:06:39.830> in<00:06:40.250> front<00:06:40.550> of<00:06:40.729> all<00:06:40.849> this<00:06:41.000> getting<00:06:41.449> those

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
layer in front of all this getting those

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.510 
layer in front of all this getting those
three<00:06:42.379> things<00:06:42.590> then<00:06:43.060> the<00:06:44.110> direct<00:06:45.110> line<00:06:45.520> the

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
three things then the direct line the

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.830 
three things then the direct line the
shadow<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:48.020> backlight<00:06:49.569> somebody<00:06:50.569> left<00:06:50.720> a

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
shadow the backlight somebody left a

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.020 
shadow the backlight somebody left a
comment<00:06:51.080> on<00:06:51.349> that<00:06:51.550> backlighting<00:06:52.550> video<00:06:52.819> and

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
comment on that backlighting video and

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.749 
comment on that backlighting video and
named<00:06:53.569> to<00:06:53.599> this<00:06:53.960> effect<00:06:54.409> I<00:06:54.770> can't<00:06:55.580> remember

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
named to this effect I can't remember

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.110 
named to this effect I can't remember
what<00:06:56.060> what<00:06:56.750> they<00:06:56.840> said<00:06:57.699> so<00:06:58.699> there's<00:06:58.940> probably

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
what what they said so there's probably

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.450 
what what they said so there's probably
more<00:06:59.539> appropriate<00:07:00.020> term<00:07:00.199> in<00:07:00.409> this<00:07:00.530> back<00:07:01.250> but<00:07:01.400> I

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
more appropriate term in this back but I

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.909 
more appropriate term in this back but I
just<00:07:01.639> know<00:07:01.759> any<00:07:01.909> videography<00:07:02.569> for<00:07:03.560> Twitter's

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
just know any videography for Twitter's

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.350 
just know any videography for Twitter's
back<00:07:04.159> way<00:07:05.530> let's<00:07:06.530> call<00:07:07.250> that<00:07:07.400> a<00:07:07.460> wrap<00:07:07.669> until

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
back way let's call that a wrap until

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:24.550 
back way let's call that a wrap until
next

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560
