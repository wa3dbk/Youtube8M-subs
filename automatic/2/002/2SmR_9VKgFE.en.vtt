00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello UTB psycho arthur and today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.620
 we will be the third video of the cycle and boards 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.590
 fillings to 4502 b and this time it will be 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.960
 just total annihilation now 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.859
 just all the power of the sneaker will be shown 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 in one fight 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.420
 Well, this is understandable card we just have it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.519
 the best option for any heavy tank 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.800
 really ruinberg and ruinberg on fire 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.070
 these are the two best city maps in our 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 the game if you play on a heavy tank 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.680
 if you don't have a master if you play 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.450
 on an armored bag for anything 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 on all that game is this alpha strike and where 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 itâ€™s just perfect for you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 ruinberg 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 that is, no other card will allow 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.309
 so you just drop dead and then play 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.329
 pok-ta-pok allows on this map 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 just just turn on god mod now i'm 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.100
 I will show how this is done of course so that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 include year bolt need to know this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 a long combination for sneaker 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.150
 combination to become a water building 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 expose the forehead and just spin out 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.570
 give spikes without receiving damage in response to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.700
 in our case, I do this myself 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 aggressive position that is there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 where are I going now without covering allies 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.960
 it is generally not recommended to go 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.930
 on which tank meeting here at once and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.729
 101 which in stock but took a similar 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.340
 position also decided 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 words so then say the boards and would 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 I have a gun of any abductions to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.180
 student 14 i would cumulatively notably him 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.780
 registered now here in this cheek but so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.790
 just like me here 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 311 penetration especially since we also 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.530
 podkaliber here's a board especially 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.360
 cheeks inaccessible 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.890
 break through so I don't touch him and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.100
 inflicting damage on those who gape or 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.960
 there turned the tower as in up to 200 ms 5 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.310
 so as not to waste time because early 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.350
 or later anyway these opponent 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.470
 it will be necessary to burst 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.259
 who else but me in general begins the most 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.050
 fun drives up first mate bears 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.160
 will try to try to try 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.360
 shoot but as soon as they realize 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 the fact that I can do nothing 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.519
 sneaker they just can not turned up 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.290
 Further part I really a bit like that 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.150
 Framed his seven because not 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.330
 just managed to navigate that is 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.610
 roll back the right moment but find out 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.560
 sneaker machine is not very angry so 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.260
 This sevens need to adapt to that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.140
 how i move they are the other way around in this this 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.959
 not a problem anymore 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.640
 when I probably did not want to but those 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.050
 time you can see how much 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.750
 here are the opponents that is here 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.900
 a few iso eighths a little further and with 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.070
 spoils x50 20 be here some 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.630
 tanks are a little less armored on too 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.250
 there is an engine heel I could not 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.010
 quietly shoot from I had to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.650
 would have to deploy the body 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.500
 win back diamond accordingly 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 we are their middle ones here is my 7 who is there from behind 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.070
 it is worth it they could not normally 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.600
 shoot and maybe they didn't even let me 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.120
 become the one 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.620
 reverse rhombus and no i could not 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.720
 it's ok to work here accordingly 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.860
 and nakida well and distribute as much homework 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.959
 too, would not be able to 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.519
 Well, that's leaving now on the center 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.799
 boys 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.400
 keep track of time my allies us patterns 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.099
 more precisely from the center decided to go 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.549
 was there not very lucky that is they to us 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.920
 I shoot from not profitable side 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.870
 let's say so no one worked 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.730
 ok dance well and especially slippers 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.139
 still a symbol of a wrench me in stock 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.079
 kirtana and sims leftovers cannot 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.939
 feel calm like i am on a tank 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.590
 I am here to us you are just on the center exhaust 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.840
 Well, that between starkiller all nose is not there 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.450
 throws over and again will drive our 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.700
 stitches and immediately put the roller here 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.319
 the seven and just now we will analyze you 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 see that on not even became became me 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.150
 look at realized that punch me and not 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.620
 it seems no possibility and this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.500
 correct in fact if you don't 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.359
 you can break through the tank . 1 of 3 2 1 gold 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.280
 This is vbh but if you understand what is not 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.739
 punches and you don't know what's wrong with him 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.109
 do better throw this venture seriously 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.120
 that's how I Wait you first that I have 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.760
 he shot only when already 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.650
 just shoots there was no one else 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 how good is luck if I have gone there 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.419
 a little bit more armor to something 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.479
 311 then yes the option to punch but still 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.900
 for the fact that I used to sneak all 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.960
 guys and cumulatives don't like them there 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.370
 but the situation when you need to punch really 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.909
 large amount of armor 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.180
 especially at some angle there is nothing 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.430
 better cumulative checks especially when 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.039
 it's about such usual armor what 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.990
 101 there are no tut.by screens just 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.030
 get yourself in the booking and you 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.680
 punch that is one touch cumulative 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.979
 cheek with 340 breakdown 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.500
 and bye here you can see how on 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.720
 tank tank is not worth it is mate 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.320
 before probably a lesson and accordingly 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.780
 constantly to the points I already scored 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.539
 that is, I just saw what it is 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.050
 there didn't shoot it was a land mine i just 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.690
 turned away from him i decided to 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.319
 + q is better than 85 in this situation to me 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.330
 seemed more dangerous 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.000
 see a person continues to do the same 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.000
 the most calm instead 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.110
 hide the whole board for this 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.120
 the construction on which the harp which he 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.490
 standing up to a pile of rubbish but calm 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.889
 hide her board stick out one face 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.930
 as I did quietly and tanchik 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.240
 yes he would have a little bluetooth to turn 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.639
 the tower but still an opportunity like it was 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.310
 he did not pay for it 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.430
 my life itself is nothing useful 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.289
 here did not really I saw at all 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.129
 how is he involved somehow were only in 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.830
 the very end therefore the plot of the battle is not and 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.650
 lost because I 'll be the same 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.520
 kicking sneakers like i quite possible 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.469
 the situation could change dramatically 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.090
 I advise all lovers of heavy tanks 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.889
 as soon as possible 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.210
 deflate your sneaker what are you getting 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.789
 opportunity sometimes on city maps 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.370
 switch such a kick out and just 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.530
 mercilessly bend on armor thanks for 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.090
