00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
line there so it to me that's a little

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:50.510 
line there so it to me that's a little
bit<00:01:38.030> more<00:01:38.179> exciting

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 

I<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.990> made<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.259> sport<00:01:52.590> extreme

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
I know it's what made this sport extreme

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
I know it's what made this sport extreme
at<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> beginning<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.820> whole<00:01:54.539> shotting<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
at the beginning was whole shotting and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.410 
at the beginning was whole shotting and
stuff<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.729> hopefully<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.240> back

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
stuff like that so hopefully we get back

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080 
stuff like that so hopefully we get back
to<00:01:57.539> that<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.950> think<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
to that I think what they got here that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
to that I think what they got here that
rolling<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.630> by<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.289> a<00:02:01.469> good<00:02:01.740> deal

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
rolling two by two is a good deal

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.880 
rolling two by two is a good deal
because<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:03.149> seem<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.539> have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.770> bit

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
because we seem to have a little bit

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.130 
because we seem to have a little bit
cleaner<00:02:05.280> opening<00:02:05.909> laps<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
cleaner opening laps and that's what you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.359 
cleaner opening laps and that's what you
need<00:02:07.319> you<00:02:07.469> don't<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.099> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> lose

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
need you don't you don't want to lose

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
up to core and we'll see what core wants

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.120 
up to core and we'll see what core wants
but<00:03:25.210> you're<00:03:25.390> asking<00:03:25.840> court<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.320> was<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.070> was

but you're asking court I was I was
asking<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.760> track<00:03:27.970> owners<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.650> their<00:03:29.650> kind

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
asking the track owners and their kind

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.260 
asking the track owners and their kind
of<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.070> for<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.400> too<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:30.850> maybe<00:03:30.970> well<00:03:31.240> maybe

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
of all for it too so maybe well maybe

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.200 
of all for it too so maybe well maybe
we'll<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> little<00:03:32.650> bit<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.190> sway<00:03:33.820> there

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.350 
we'll have a little bit of a sway there
and<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:35.290> believe<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.920> core<00:03:36.550> might<00:03:36.970> want<00:03:37.210> to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
and I believe that core might want to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.290 
and I believe that core might want to
mix<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.350> try<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.680> once<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.310> if<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.180> the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
mix it up to try it once and if it's the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.000 
mix it up to try it once and if it's the
last<00:03:40.480> race<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.959> year<00:03:41.230> I'm<00:03:41.410> all<00:03:41.620> for<00:03:41.890> it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
last race of the year I'm all for it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:55.680 
last race of the year I'm all for it
because<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.430> know<00:03:42.550> what<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.090> will<00:03:43.390> mix<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.780> up

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690
