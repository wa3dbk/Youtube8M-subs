tell I'm really pale I had to go with it
though<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.820> would<00:03:07.910> blend<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.300> with<00:03:08.450> my<00:03:08.660> skin

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
though so it would blend in with my skin

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.990 
though so it would blend in with my skin
of<00:03:09.110> course<00:03:09.380> but<00:03:10.070> during<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.490> summer<00:03:10.730> i'll

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
of course but during the summer i'll

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880 
of course but during the summer i'll
probably<00:03:11.210> get<00:03:11.450> tanner<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.900> then<00:03:12.230> i'll<00:03:12.740> have

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
probably get tanner and then i'll have
