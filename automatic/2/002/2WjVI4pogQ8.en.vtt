00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
really this video takes you through a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.140 
really this video takes you through a
progression<00:00:33.740> so<00:00:34.640> there's<00:00:34.790> going<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:34.970> be<00:00:35.030> a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
progression so there's going to be a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.100 
progression so there's going to be a
number<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.540> different<00:00:35.780> things<00:00:35.900> we're<00:00:36.020> going

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
number of different things we're going

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.600 
number of different things we're going
to<00:00:36.200> talk<00:00:36.350> about<00:00:36.500> today<00:00:36.770> on<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.190> driving<00:00:37.460> range

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
to talk about today on the driving range

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.810 
to talk about today on the driving range
do<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:38.480> have<00:00:38.510> not<00:00:38.900> covered<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:39.440> previous

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
do we have not covered in previous

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.550 
do we have not covered in previous
sessions<00:00:40.930> specifically<00:00:41.930> with<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.230> swing<00:00:42.470> and

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
sessions specifically with the swing and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.350 
sessions specifically with the swing and
we<00:00:42.650> did<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.830> intentionally<00:00:43.280> because<00:00:44.210> you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
we did that intentionally because you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.450 
we did that intentionally because you
can<00:00:44.510> only<00:00:44.570> really<00:00:44.780> absorb<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.710> much<00:00:45.770> at<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.160> time

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
can only really absorb so much at a time

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.900 
can only really absorb so much at a time
so<00:00:47.120> what<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.750> actually<00:00:47.900> get<00:00:48.140> on<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.350> range

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
so what you actually get on the range

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.640 
so what you actually get on the range
there's<00:00:49.910> some<00:00:50.540> really<00:00:50.720> fundamental<00:00:51.080> things

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
there's some really fundamental things

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.299 
there's some really fundamental things
to<00:00:52.370> watch<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:54.080> learn<00:00:54.470> specifically

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
to watch for and to learn specifically

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.119 
to watch for and to learn specifically
power<00:00:55.760> why<00:00:56.720> things<00:00:57.110> go<00:00:57.230> left<00:00:57.620> why<00:00:57.830> things<00:00:58.070> go

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
power why things go left why things go

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.590 
power why things go left why things go
right<00:00:58.400> so<00:00:58.670> we're<00:00:58.760> going<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.970> try<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.180> cover<00:00:59.390> all

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
right so we're going to try to cover all

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.390 
right so we're going to try to cover all
those<00:00:59.750> things<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.290> help<00:01:00.770> them<00:01:00.980> out<00:01:01.159> a<00:01:01.220> little

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
those things and help them out a little

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600 
those things and help them out a little
bit<00:01:01.610> on<00:01:02.360> his<00:01:02.870> specific<00:01:03.350> swing<00:01:03.890> problems<00:01:04.339> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
bit on his specific swing problems and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.760 
bit on his specific swing problems and
we'll<00:01:05.030> take<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.239> from<00:01:05.300> there<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.170> first<00:01:06.500> when

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
we'll take it from there so first when

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.149 
we'll take it from there so first when
you're<00:01:06.950> coming<00:01:07.700> up<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> driving<00:01:08.240> range

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
you're coming up to the driving range

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.340 
you're coming up to the driving range
just<00:01:10.159> pick<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.340> spot<00:01:10.700> with<00:01:11.420> obviously<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.229> most

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
just pick a spot with obviously the most

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.530 
just pick a spot with obviously the most
grass<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:14.270> you're<00:01:14.420> really

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
grass on it and so that you're really

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.110 
grass on it and so that you're really
not<00:01:14.720> hitting<00:01:14.990> into<00:01:15.080> dirt<00:01:15.550> this<00:01:16.550> bag<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.090> i

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
not hitting into dirt this bag that i

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.120 
not hitting into dirt this bag that i
have<00:01:17.420> actually<00:01:17.630> is<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.710> that's<00:01:18.890> going<00:01:19.040> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
have actually is one that's going to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.230 
have actually is one that's going to
stand<00:01:19.430> up<00:01:19.640> for<00:01:19.670> me<00:01:20.680> other<00:01:21.680> bags<00:01:22.130> are<00:01:22.880> called

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
stand up for me other bags are called

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.480 
stand up for me other bags are called
cart<00:01:23.510> bags<00:01:23.720> they<00:01:23.990> don't<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.560> legs<00:01:25.220> on

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
cart bags they don't have the legs on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.510 
cart bags they don't have the legs on
them<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.510> they<00:01:26.870> have<00:01:27.049> these<00:01:27.320> specific<00:01:28.280> things

find yourself a spot that's a kind of a
way<00:01:49.820> from<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.049> rope<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.119> rope

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
way from this rope because this rope

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.899 
way from this rope because this rope
wherever<00:01:54.710> they<00:01:54.829> roped<00:01:55.130> off<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.520> really<00:01:55.759> where

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
wherever they roped off is really where

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.990 
wherever they roped off is really where
they<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.659> start<00:01:57.880> hitting<00:01:58.880> they

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.160 
they want you to start hitting they
don't<00:01:59.149> really<00:01:59.270> want<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.570> hit<00:01:59.689> inside<00:02:00.049> or

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
don't really want to hit inside or

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.749 
don't really want to hit inside or
outside<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.500> rope<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:00.979> really<00:02:01.250> watch<00:02:01.460> this

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
outside the rope but really watch this

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.529 
outside the rope but really watch this
rope<00:02:02.090> because<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.109> don't<00:02:03.320> want<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.649> be

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
rope because you don't want to be

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.819 
rope because you don't want to be
anywhere<00:02:05.539> where<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.960> club<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.289> going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.560> grab

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
anywhere where the club is going to grab

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.790 
anywhere where the club is going to grab
on<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.159> rope<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.729> twist<00:02:08.539> your<00:02:08.750> wrist<00:02:09.619> or

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
on to that rope and twist your wrist or

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.990 
on to that rope and twist your wrist or
anything<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.789> actually

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
anything like that so this actually

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.490 
anything like that so this actually
right<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:11.450> looks<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.930> nice<00:02:12.170> patch<00:02:12.470> of

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
right here looks like a nice patch of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.160 
right here looks like a nice patch of
grass<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.300> lot<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.420> times<00:02:14.630> we'll<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:14.900> mark

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
grass a lot of times we'll have mark

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.730 
grass a lot of times we'll have mark
stalls<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.950> these<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:17.630> these<00:02:18.200> little<00:02:18.530> hitting

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
stalls in these in these little hitting

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.240 
stalls in these in these little hitting
areas<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:21.560> wherever<00:02:21.770> you're<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
areas so wherever you're going to
