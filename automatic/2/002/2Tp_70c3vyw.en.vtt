00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
ipad 3 predictions so let's get right to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.280 
ipad 3 predictions so let's get right to
it<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.820> all<00:00:11.969> know<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.389> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.780> made

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it so we all know it's going to be made

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.910 
it so we all know it's going to be made
by<00:00:13.559> apple<00:00:14.040> on<00:00:14.599> next<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.990> hopefully<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
by apple on next we have hopefully the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
by apple on next we have hopefully the
back-facing<00:00:17.490> camera<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> better

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
back-facing camera can get a better

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.490 
back-facing camera can get a better
resolution<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> 720p

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
resolution as we know it's in 720p

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.279 
resolution as we know it's in 720p
hopefully<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:22.949> into<00:00:23.189> 180<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.480> p<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
hopefully we can get into 180 or p and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.400 
hopefully we can get into 180 or p and
that<00:00:25.410> would<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.619> really<00:00:26.400> cool<00:00:26.550> um<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.260> know

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
that would be really cool um as we know

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.040 
that would be really cool um as we know
the<00:00:28.680> front-facing<00:00:29.340> cameras<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.119> vga<00:00:30.750> camera

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the front-facing cameras or vga camera

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
the front-facing cameras or vga camera
such<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> webcam<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.820> hopefully<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
such as a webcam so hopefully they can

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
such as a webcam so hopefully they can
push<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:35.090> 720p<00:00:36.649> HD<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.890> whatever<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
push that up to 720p HD or whatever and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
push that up to 720p HD or whatever and
that<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.690> nice<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> ipad<00:00:42.379> 03

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that would be really nice so the ipad 03

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
that would be really nice so the ipad 03
comes<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.579> two<00:00:44.879> colors<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:45.899> black<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
comes in two colors as we know black and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.270 
comes in two colors as we know black and
white<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:48.149> iphone<00:00:48.300> 4<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.500> come<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> red

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
white and the iphone 4 can come in red

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.660 
white and the iphone 4 can come in red
blue<00:00:50.789> black<00:00:51.239> white<00:00:51.300> etc<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:53.250> pretty

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
blue black white etc and that's pretty

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
blue black white etc and that's pretty
nice<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.360> hopefully<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.350> Apple<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.520> would<00:00:57.000> be

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
nice and hopefully on Apple all would be

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
nice and hopefully on Apple all would be
able<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.350> four

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
able to do that make it in four

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
able to do that make it in four
different<00:00:59.010> colors<00:00:59.399> we<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.329> theres<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.719> now

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
different colors we know theres two now

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
different colors we know theres two now
so<00:01:01.170> hopefully<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.739> red<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.070> blue<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so hopefully can get red and blue and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.070 
so hopefully can get red and blue and
that<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.300> awesome<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.619> yeah<00:01:05.900> next<00:01:06.900> we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that would be awesome and yeah next we

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
that would be awesome and yeah next we
have<00:01:07.200> hopefully<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.549> flash

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
have hopefully they can get flash

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.969 
have hopefully they can get flash
capability<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> keep<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.470> saying<00:01:10.500> these

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
capability and no I keep on saying these

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
capability and no I keep on saying these
in<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.549> predictions<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.540> hopefully<00:01:13.530> I'll

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
in my predictions but hopefully I'll

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.200 
in my predictions but hopefully I'll
Apple<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.060> flash<00:01:15.360> because

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
Apple would make it get flash because

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.960 
Apple would make it get flash because
you<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.990> youtube<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.189> your

any iDevice out now um hopefully the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
any iDevice out now um hopefully the
pricing<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.119> device

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pricing will be the same for the device

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
pricing will be the same for the device
we<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> pricing<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
we know that this is the pricing for the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.740 
we know that this is the pricing for the
ipad<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> ipad<00:01:34.200> 2<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> ipad<00:01:35.460> 2<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ipad and ipad 2 for the ipad 2 when the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
ipad and ipad 2 for the ipad 2 when the
ipad<00:01:37.229> came<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> pricings

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
ipad came out these were the pricings

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
ipad came out these were the pricings
and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.509> ipad<00:01:39.869> 2<00:01:40.079> came<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.500> these<00:01:40.860> were

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and then the ipad 2 came out these were

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039 
and then the ipad 2 came out these were
still<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> pricings<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.299> hopefully<00:01:42.960> when

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
still the pricings and hopefully when

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
still the pricings and hopefully when
the<00:01:43.110> ipad<00:01:43.500> 3<00:01:43.920> comes<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.430> these<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.850> still<00:01:45.090> be

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the ipad 3 comes out these will still be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
the ipad 3 comes out these will still be
the<00:01:45.360> pricings<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.740> ipad<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> ipad<00:01:47.610> 2

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the pricings and the ipad and ipad 2

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960 
the pricings and the ipad and ipad 2
would<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> lower<00:01:48.540> price<00:01:48.869> um<00:01:49.610> maybe<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
would have a lower price um maybe it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.910 
would have a lower price um maybe it
could<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.380> three-dimensional<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.619> all

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
could get a three-dimensional look all

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
could get a three-dimensional look all
you<00:01:53.220> don't<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.549> any<00:01:53.700> 3d<00:01:54.030> glasses<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.079> my

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you don't need any 3d glasses so in my

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.570 
you don't need any 3d glasses so in my
opinion<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.890> would<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.100> called<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:57.299> d

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
opinion it would be called for d

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.690 
opinion it would be called for d
and<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.870> comes<00:02:00.110> peach<00:02:00.650> with<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.160> only

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and that comes peach with the only

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.330 
and that comes peach with the only
device<00:02:02.000> out<00:02:02.300> there<00:02:02.420> right<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.020> with<00:02:03.530> 3d<00:02:04.130> in

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
3ds so if the ipad 3 gets it it will be

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.160 
3ds so if the ipad 3 gets it it will be
pretty<00:02:10.610> hopefully<00:02:11.120> called<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.480> 40<00:02:11.960> because

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
pretty hopefully called the 40 because

be nice this is given we all know the
ipad<00:02:29.900> 3<00:02:30.200> will<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.560> thinner<00:02:31.340> than<00:02:31.700> before<00:02:33.490> next

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
ipad 3 will be thinner than before next

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.430 
ipad 3 will be thinner than before next
as<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.760> guys<00:02:34.940> see<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> phones<00:02:35.630> they<00:02:36.200> have

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
as you guys see on the phones they have

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.580 
as you guys see on the phones they have
the<00:02:36.680> are<00:02:37.010> flash<00:02:37.520> like<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.870> take<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> photo

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the are flash like when you take a photo

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.070 
the are flash like when you take a photo
it<00:02:39.950> take<00:02:40.670> makes<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.150> flash<00:02:41.390> that'd<00:02:41.690> be<00:02:41.840> really

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
it take makes it flash that'd be really

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.530 
it take makes it flash that'd be really
cool<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.770> ipad<00:02:43.100> 3<00:02:43.340> had<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.450> would

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
cool if the ipad 3 had that and it would

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.930 
cool if the ipad 3 had that and it would
be<00:02:44.570> an<00:02:44.750> LED<00:02:45.290> light<00:02:45.320> or<00:02:45.740> even<00:02:46.550> if<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.760> gets

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
be an LED light or even if it gets

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.110 
be an LED light or even if it gets
better<00:02:47.270> than<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.550> different<00:02:49.550> kind<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.910> light

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
better than a different kind of light

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.070 
better than a different kind of light
and<00:02:50.930> that'd<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.590> really<00:02:51.890> cool<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:53.080> um

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
and that'd be really cool to have um

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.310 
and that'd be really cool to have um
next<00:02:55.040> hopefully<00:02:55.220> they<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:55.550> get<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.850> new<00:02:56.320> chip

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
next hopefully they can get a new chip

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.640 
next hopefully they can get a new chip
may<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.130> an<00:02:58.310> a6<00:02:58.940> processor<00:02:59.270> as<00:02:59.870> we<00:03:00.500> all<00:03:00.620> know

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
may be an a6 processor as we all know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.460 
may be an a6 processor as we all know
it's<00:03:01.040> an<00:03:01.160> a5<00:03:01.610> right<00:03:02.000> now<00:03:02.180> for<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.810> device<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's an a5 right now for the device and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.520 
it's an a5 right now for the device and
an<00:03:03.680> a6<00:03:04.160> would<00:03:04.370> make<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.670> extremely<00:03:05.269> fast<00:03:05.720> or

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
an a6 would make it extremely fast or

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.180 
an a6 would make it extremely fast or
hopefully<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:08.290> Apple<00:03:09.290> would<00:03:09.440> keep<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:09.860> mark

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
hopefully the Apple would keep this mark

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.100 
hopefully the Apple would keep this mark
/<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.550> know<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:11.030> not<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.300> great<00:03:11.600> but

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
/ I know it's not that great but

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.170 
/ I know it's not that great but
hopefully<00:03:12.620> they<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.130> make<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> lot<00:03:13.940> better

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
hopefully they can make it a lot better

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.080 
hopefully they can make it a lot better
so<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.230> an<00:03:15.650> awesome<00:03:15.920> smart<00:03:16.489> cover<00:03:16.730> for

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
so it can be an awesome smart cover for

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.759 
so it can be an awesome smart cover for
the<00:03:17.180> device<00:03:17.480> which<00:03:17.810> actually<00:03:18.050> covers<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
the device which actually covers the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.830 
the device which actually covers the
whole<00:03:18.800> device<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.580> hopefully<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.540> won't<00:03:20.750> be

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
whole device and hopefully it won't be

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.270 
whole device and hopefully it won't be
held<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.500> magnets<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.550> side<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:24.280> um

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
held by magnets on the side and um

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.880 
held by magnets on the side and um
hopefully<00:03:25.670> you'll<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.150> better<00:03:26.390> microphone

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
hopefully you'll have better microphone

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.100 
hopefully you'll have better microphone
capabilities<00:03:27.890> are<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.209> able<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.630> talk

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
capabilities are you can be able to talk

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.710 
capabilities are you can be able to talk
really<00:03:30.410> close<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.160> loud<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.760> it'll<00:03:32.390> be<00:03:32.510> far

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
really close so be loud and it'll be far

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.229 
really close so be loud and it'll be far
away<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.680> can<00:03:33.860> still<00:03:34.100> talk<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.730> OB<00:03:35.120> is

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
away and you can still talk and OB is

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.500 
away and you can still talk and OB is
the<00:03:35.420> same<00:03:35.690> voice<00:03:36.700> kind<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.910> pitch<00:03:38.720> outside

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the same voice kind of pitch outside

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.370 
the same voice kind of pitch outside
hopefully<00:03:41.510> they<00:03:41.660> can<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.989> able<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.260> add<00:03:42.320> a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
hopefully they can be able to add a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.170 
hopefully they can be able to add a
louder<00:03:42.650> speaker<00:03:43.190> even<00:03:43.519> though<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:43.880> really

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
louder speaker even though it's really

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.030 
louder speaker even though it's really
loud<00:03:44.540> now<00:03:44.780> hopefully<00:03:45.530> they<00:03:45.680> can<00:03:45.739> get<00:03:45.980> it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
loud now hopefully they can get it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.920 
loud now hopefully they can get it
louder<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.420> another<00:03:47.660> given<00:03:48.170> on

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
louder this is another given on

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.089 
louder this is another given on
even<00:03:49.409> though<00:03:49.730> aha<00:03:50.730> geo<00:03:51.480> hot<00:03:51.810> or<00:03:52.109> connective

even though aha geo hot or connective

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.679 
even though aha geo hot or connective
they'll<00:03:53.400> probably<00:03:53.609> making<00:03:53.909> really<00:03:54.420> good

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
they'll probably making really good

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.530 
they'll probably making really good
jailbreak<00:03:55.230> for<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.159> ipad<00:03:56.579> 3<00:03:56.939> even<00:03:57.390> though

jailbreak for the ipad 3 even though

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.929 
jailbreak for the ipad 3 even though
apple<00:03:57.959> doesn't<00:03:58.349> really<00:03:58.709> like<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.189> but<00:03:59.579> they

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
apple doesn't really like it but they

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.050 
apple doesn't really like it but they
approved<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.480> anyway<00:04:01.040> okay<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.280> that's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
approved it anyway okay and that's

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.390 
approved it anyway okay and that's
pretty<00:04:03.269> much<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.599> for<00:04:03.780> my<00:04:04.140> ipad<00:04:04.500> 3<00:04:04.799> predictions

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
pretty much it for my ipad 3 predictions
