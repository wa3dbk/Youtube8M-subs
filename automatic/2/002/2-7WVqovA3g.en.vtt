 Lead singer: Gao Qin Guitar: Yuan Xiang Guitar: Pei Hua Bass: Xiao Zuo Drums: MOMO

 Color words: Who is not bent: Zeng Yibian: EST 挚 团 sing: EST 挚 Orchestra 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.120
 Black white red yellow 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.400
 What color are you? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.320
 Where does the habit language come from? 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.960
 Not necessarily at all 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.200
 I want to say what I said 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.600
 Contradictory contradictions 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 Black white red yellow 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 Can't escape the difference 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 We acquiesce in the color to become a sharp edge 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.920
 Silent and uninterrupted draws mottled scars 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.280
 Why are we 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 Never-ending struggle 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 Watching all the blood and tears do not smell 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.240
 Let us see through 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.480
 This great excuse 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.440
 Color should not be a symbol of differentiation 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.000
 Black white red yellow 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320
 What color are you? 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.080
 Where does the habit language come from? 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.346
 Not necessarily at all 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 I want to say what I said 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 Contradictory contradictions 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.479
 Black white red yellow 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.839
 Can't escape the difference 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.440
 We acquiesce in the color to become a sharp edge 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.840
 Silent and uninterrupted draws mottled scars 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.360
 Why are we fighting forever? 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.040
 Watching all the blood and tears do not smell 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.680
 Let us see through this great excuse 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 Color should not be a symbol of differentiation 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.820
 Forgot all the colors 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.680
 There will be new choices 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.480
 What is it for roaring? 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.420
 We acquiesce in the color to become a sharp edge 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.520
 Silent and uninterrupted draws mottled scars 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.500
 Why are we 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.140
 Never-ending struggle 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.180
 Watching all the blood and tears do not smell 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.400
 Let us see through 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.700
 This great excuse 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.100
 Color should not be a symbol of differentiation 

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:07.034
 Thank you for watching
