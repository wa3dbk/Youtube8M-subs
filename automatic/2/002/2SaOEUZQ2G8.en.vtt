00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
themselves when they go for a summit I'm

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
themselves when they go for a summit I'm
the<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> guy<00:00:38.970> who<00:00:39.030> shows<00:00:39.630> up<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.080> takes

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the kind of guy who shows up and takes

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.320 
the kind of guy who shows up and takes
off<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:41.490> hour<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.240> I'm

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
off for the first hour and then I'm

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.550 
off for the first hour and then I'm
exhausted<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.930> guess<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
exhausted I guess that's not the way to

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.140 
exhausted I guess that's not the way to
go<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.310> probably<00:00:44.790> not<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
go right that's probably not going to

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.550 
go right that's probably not going to
add<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.480> person<00:00:45.900> used<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.230> enough<00:00:46.380> energy

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
add up person used to have enough energy

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.620 
add up person used to have enough energy
to<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.120> down<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
to get to the top and then back down to

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.750 
to get to the top and then back down to
the<00:00:48.720> car<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.440> you're<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.250> slower

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the car so you're probably going slower

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
the car so you're probably going slower
than<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> should<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> start
