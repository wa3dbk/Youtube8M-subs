for you so the closure came a lot

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.700 
for you so the closure came a lot
lighter<00:01:50.610> than<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.299> actual<00:01:51.720> wig<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
lighter than the actual wig because I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.870 
lighter than the actual wig because I
had<00:01:52.950> previously<00:01:53.490> dyed<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.090> hair<00:01:54.500> jet-black

had previously dyed the hair jet-black
and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.180> natural<00:01:57.570> black<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and the natural black is more like a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
and the natural black is more like a
color<00:01:58.649> number<00:01:59.009> two<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.320> had<00:02:01.920> only<00:02:02.340> some<00:02:02.820> semi

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.700 
color number two so I had only some semi
permanent<00:02:04.219> hair<00:02:05.219> color<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> rinse<00:02:06.509> from

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
manic manic panic I think is what it's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.910 
manic manic panic I think is what it's
called<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.860> color<00:02:11.069> Raven<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.290> left<00:02:13.740> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
called and the color Raven so I left it

on<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.580> 35<00:02:15.240> minutes<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
on there for about 35 minutes and I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.090 
on there for about 35 minutes and I
rinsed<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.930> still<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.680> mean<00:02:19.890> it's

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
rinsed it out and it's still I mean it's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.370 
rinsed it out and it's still I mean it's
not<00:02:20.400> jet<00:02:20.940> black<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:22.580> it's<00:02:23.580> black<00:02:24.480> enough<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
not jet black but it's black enough to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.430 
not jet black but it's black enough to
blend<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.830> rest<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> hair<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:27.319> let<00:02:28.319> it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
blend with the rest of the hair I let it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.920 
blend with the rest of the hair I let it
dry<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.580> actually<00:02:29.790> blow-dried<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.690> cuz<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
dry then I actually blow-dried it cuz it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
dry then I actually blow-dried it cuz it
was<00:02:31.020> taking<00:02:31.440> way<00:02:31.650> too<00:02:31.680> long<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:35.000> flat

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
was taking way too long and I flat

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.140 
was taking way too long and I flat
ironed<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> straight<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.760> end

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
ironed it straight so this was the end

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.780 
ironed it straight so this was the end
result<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.440> am<00:02:40.560> overall<00:02:41.070> happy<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
result and I am overall happy with the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.740 
result and I am overall happy with the
look<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.480> wig<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.920> am<00:02:44.459> unhappy<00:02:45.330> with

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
look of the wig but I am unhappy with

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.690 
look of the wig but I am unhappy with
the<00:02:46.019> look<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.709> closure<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.550> has

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
the look of the closure and it has

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.580 
the look of the closure and it has
nothing<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.269> do<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> actual<00:02:49.260> closure

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
nothing to do with the actual closure

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.460 
nothing to do with the actual closure
itself<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.180> has<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
itself and it has to do with the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.720 
itself and it has to do with the
operator<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.650> watched<00:02:55.650> three<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.400> four<00:02:56.610> videos

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
operator I watched three or four videos

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.180 
operator I watched three or four videos
on<00:02:57.390> how<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.810> sew<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.890> closure<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.880> u-part<00:03:00.269> wig

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
on how to sew a closure on to u-part wig

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.460 
on how to sew a closure on to u-part wig
it's<00:03:02.190> something<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.959> gonna<00:03:04.140> take

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
it's something that is just gonna take

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.509 
it's something that is just gonna take
practice<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.519> good<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:07.319> do<00:03:08.220> not

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
practice to get good at and I do not

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.400 
practice to get good at and I do not
think<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.180> willing<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.720> put<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.230> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
think I'm willing to put in that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.520 
think I'm willing to put in that
practice<00:03:10.680> therefore<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.850> will<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.660> doing

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
practice therefore I will not be doing

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.310 
practice therefore I will not be doing
this<00:03:13.829> again<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:15.000> say<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.870> maybe<00:03:16.079> I'll

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
this again and I say that and maybe I'll

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.280 
this again and I say that and maybe I'll
get<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> urge<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:17.130> do<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.299> just<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.930> took

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
get the urge to do it but I just it took

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
get the urge to do it but I just it took
way<00:03:19.829> too<00:03:19.860> long<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:22.489> it's<00:03:23.489> harder<00:03:24.120> than<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
way too long and it's harder than it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.590 
way too long and it's harder than it
actually<00:03:24.660> looks<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:26.370> two<00:03:26.579> even<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
actually looks one two even so the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.590 
actually looks one two even so the
closure<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> way<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.390> do

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
closure on to the way you have to do

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.319 
closure on to the way you have to do
some<00:03:30.810> weird<00:03:31.079> threading<00:03:31.799> patterns<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.640> then

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
some weird threading patterns and then

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.810 
some weird threading patterns and then
to<00:03:33.540> actually<00:03:33.989> get<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.010> know<00:03:35.130> sew<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.579> onto

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
to actually get it you know sew it onto

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.600 
to actually get it you know sew it onto
your<00:03:36.150> hair<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.410> another<00:03:37.829> thing<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.280> really

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
your hair it's another thing you really

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.270 
your hair it's another thing you really
have<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.030> braid<00:03:39.360> your<00:03:39.660> hair<00:03:39.829> correctly<00:03:40.829> and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
have to braid your hair correctly and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.940 
have to braid your hair correctly and
you<00:03:41.370> probably<00:03:41.640> should<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.420> like<00:03:42.720> some<00:03:43.049> some

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you probably should get like some some

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.610 
you probably should get like some some
bulk<00:03:44.400> hair<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.510> know<00:03:45.630> like<00:03:45.900> when<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:46.380> box

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
bulk hair you know like when you do box

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.289 
bulk hair you know like when you do box
braids<00:03:46.950> with<00:03:47.190> two<00:03:47.489> braids<00:03:47.700> onto<00:03:48.000> your<00:03:48.120> hair

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
braids with two braids onto your hair

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.180 
braids with two braids onto your hair
because<00:03:48.690> there's<00:03:48.959> there's<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.500> no<00:03:49.890> way<00:03:50.160> that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
because there's there's just no way that

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.199 
because there's there's just no way that
you<00:03:50.609> can<00:03:51.120> get<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.829> can<00:03:53.010> get<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:53.880> here

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
you can get you can get it so it on here

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.390 
you can get you can get it so it on here
hopefully<00:03:54.690> when<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> take<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.950> off<00:03:56.130> I'll<00:03:56.370> have

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
hopefully when I take this off I'll have

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280 
hopefully when I take this off I'll have
some<00:03:56.760> hair<00:03:56.970> leftover<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.600> front<00:03:57.870> because

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
some hair leftover on the front because

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.880 
some hair leftover on the front because
not<00:03:58.859> only<00:03:58.890> did<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.340> burn<00:03:59.730> off<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.480> my<00:04:00.600> hair

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
not only did I burn off all of my hair

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.590 
not only did I burn off all of my hair
with<00:04:01.890> these<00:04:02.070> u-part<00:04:02.640> wigs<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.090> blending<00:04:03.480> my

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
with these u-part wigs and blending my

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.259 
with these u-part wigs and blending my
own<00:04:03.750> hair<00:04:04.109> but<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:05.190> get<00:04:05.310> this<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.700> lay<00:04:05.880> flat<00:04:06.209> I

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
own hair but to get this to lay flat I

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.900 
own hair but to get this to lay flat I
really<00:04:07.079> really<00:04:07.620> had<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.920> sew<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
really really had to sew this down and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.490 
really really had to sew this down and
it's<00:04:09.090> still<00:04:09.359> not<00:04:09.480> as<00:04:09.660> flat<00:04:09.900> as<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> would<00:04:10.320> like

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it's still not as flat as I would like

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.099 
it's still not as flat as I would like
it<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:10.920> with<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.790> said<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.930> what<00:04:13.079> the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
it so with that said this is what the

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.750 
it so with that said this is what the
closure<00:04:13.410> looks<00:04:13.769> slay

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.170 

so<00:04:17.570> as<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.930> can<00:04:18.080> see<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.680> had<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.250> take<00:04:19.490> tiny

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
so as you can see I had to take tiny

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.440 
so as you can see I had to take tiny
smidge<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:21.050> my<00:04:21.260> hair<00:04:21.530> out<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:23.240> tiny

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
smidge of my hair out just a tiny

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.990 
smidge of my hair out just a tiny
smidgen<00:04:23.900> one<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.860> don't<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> fresh<00:04:25.610> perm

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
smidgen one I don't have a fresh perm

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.810 
smidgen one I don't have a fresh perm
and<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.290> won't<00:04:27.620> have<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> fresh<00:04:28.220> perm<00:04:28.520> for<00:04:28.760> a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
and I won't have a fresh perm for a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.360 
and I won't have a fresh perm for a
while<00:04:29.090> I'm<00:04:29.510> just<00:04:30.380> last<00:04:30.650> one

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
while I'm just last one

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.570 
while I'm just last one
I<00:04:31.400> burned<00:04:32.270> my<00:04:32.360> hair<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.140> that's<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.010> six<00:04:34.310> I'm

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
I burned my hair and that's the six I'm

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.430 
I burned my hair and that's the six I'm
only<00:04:34.790> doing<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.300> like<00:04:35.480> every<00:04:35.780> six<00:04:36.050> months

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
only doing it like every six months

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.110 
only doing it like every six months
twice<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.920> year<00:04:37.070> that<00:04:37.280> I'm<00:04:37.400> firming<00:04:37.760> my<00:04:37.880> hair

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
twice a year that I'm firming my hair

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.020 
twice a year that I'm firming my hair
seems<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.750> be<00:04:38.870> working<00:04:39.200> for<00:04:39.410> me<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:40.010> not<00:04:40.250> all

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
seems to be working for me it's not all

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.670 
seems to be working for me it's not all
thin<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:42.620> it<00:04:42.770> was<00:04:42.950> before<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> lot

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
thin like it was before it is a lot

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.290 
thin like it was before it is a lot
harder<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:46.250> take<00:04:46.430> care<00:04:46.760> of<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.000> when<00:04:47.120> it's

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
harder to take care of it when it's

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.780 
harder to take care of it when it's
thicker<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.900> more<00:04:47.960> coarse<00:04:48.470> but<00:04:49.370> that's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
thicker and more coarse but that's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.290 
thicker and more coarse but that's
besides<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.330> point

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
besides the point

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.350 
besides the point
so<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.750> nutshell<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:55.100> sensational<00:04:56.000> Bayer

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
so in a nutshell the sensational Bayer

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.930 
so in a nutshell the sensational Bayer
natural<00:04:57.940> closure<00:04:59.230> it<00:05:00.230> I<00:05:01.190> don't<00:05:01.370> feel<00:05:01.460> like<00:05:01.760> the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
natural closure it I don't feel like the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.600 
natural closure it I don't feel like the
part<00:05:02.210> itself<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.320> in<00:05:03.500> an<00:05:03.650> L<00:05:03.860> shape<00:05:03.890> I

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
part itself it's it's in an L shape I

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.010 
part itself it's it's in an L shape I
don't<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.390> don't<00:05:05.450> think<00:05:05.570> it's<00:05:05.780> all<00:05:05.870> that

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
don't I don't think it's all that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.470 
don't I don't think it's all that
natural<00:05:06.230> looking<00:05:06.800> but<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.820> was<00:05:08.090> just<00:05:08.120> too<00:05:08.450> lazy

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
natural looking but I was just too lazy

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.510 
natural looking but I was just too lazy
and<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:08.990> didn't<00:05:09.200> feel<00:05:09.380> like<00:05:09.410> tweezing<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.250> and

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
and I didn't feel like tweezing it and

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.060 
and I didn't feel like tweezing it and
going<00:05:10.760> through<00:05:10.940> everything<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.660> did<00:05:12.290> put<00:05:12.770> some

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
going through everything I did put some

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.840 
going through everything I did put some
powder<00:05:13.340> on<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.850> part<00:05:14.120> because<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.770> not<00:05:16.130> you

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
powder on the part because it's not you

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.180 
powder on the part because it's not you
know<00:05:17.000> it's<00:05:17.360> not<00:05:17.540> dark<00:05:17.900> like<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.350> am<00:05:18.530> it's<00:05:18.800> it's

know it's not dark like I am it's it's
more<00:05:19.610> like<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:21.530> more<00:05:21.830> like<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.160> color<00:05:22.430> like
