which i think is perfect for all of our
senior<00:01:09.470> year<00:01:09.500> because<00:01:09.890> that's<00:01:10.189> that's<00:01:10.880> what

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
senior year because that's that's what

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.609 
senior year because that's that's what
this<00:01:11.270> organization<00:01:11.420> is<00:01:11.930> all<00:01:12.080> about<00:01:12.110> was<00:01:12.560> just

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
this organization is all about was just

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.889

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
about love and all that stuff I think

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.960

the<00:01:17.899> Angelica<00:01:18.439> culture<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.100> perhaps<00:01:19.399> best

the Angelica culture is perhaps best

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.300 
the Angelica culture is perhaps best
