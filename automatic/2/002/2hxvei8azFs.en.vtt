00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
little odd and I can do this because

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.380 
little odd and I can do this because
I've<00:01:54.570> got<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> firm<00:01:55.500> level<00:01:56.250> surface<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> work<00:01:57.180> on

I've got a firm level surface to work on
I'm<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> put<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.229> first<00:01:58.500> rail<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
I'm going to put my first rail down and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.740 
I'm going to put my first rail down and
then<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> clamp<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.540> position

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
then I'm going to clamp it in position

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.319 
then I'm going to clamp it in position
when<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.500> nice<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.799> level<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> can

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
when it's nice and level that way I can

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
when it's nice and level that way I can
go<00:02:03.450> along<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.020> measure<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.560> each<00:02:04.649> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
go along and I can measure for each of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
go along and I can measure for each of
my<00:02:04.890> posts

100 mil bugle batten screws and then
concrete<00:02:11.039> them<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.370> place<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.560> all<00:02:13.680> comes

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
concrete them in place then it all comes

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
concrete them in place then it all comes
together<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.550> Makar<00:02:15.030> no<00:02:15.209> for

while I'll cut this to size
I'll<00:03:18.660> give<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> coat<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> texture<00:03:19.920> paint

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.160 
I'll give it a coat with a texture paint
and<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:20.790> I'll<00:03:20.940> clad<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.329> front<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.900> sides

it<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.140> little<00:03:49.350> bit<00:03:49.470> hard<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:49.920> them

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it can be a little bit hard to get them

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.979 
it can be a little bit hard to get them
in<00:03:50.220> place<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.910> best<00:03:51.150> idea<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:51.840> what

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
in place the best idea is to do what

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.449 
in place the best idea is to do what
I've<00:03:52.140> done<00:03:52.350> I've<00:03:52.590> pre-drilled<00:03:53.280> and

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
I've done I've pre-drilled and

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.190 
I've done I've pre-drilled and
countersunk<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.359> centre<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:55.049> just

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
countersunk in the centre so I can just

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.990 
countersunk in the centre so I can just
quickly<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> screws<00:03:56.160> straight<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> hold

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
quickly get a screws straight in to hold

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.670 
quickly get a screws straight in to hold
it<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.299> place<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.840> make<00:03:57.900> sure<00:03:58.560> you

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it in place and make sure you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.229 
it in place and make sure you
countersink<00:03:59.280> when<00:03:59.400> you're<00:03:59.519> using<00:03:59.700> blue<00:04:00.000> board

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
countersink when you're using blue board

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.310 
countersink when you're using blue board
because<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.480> want<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.660> be<00:04:00.750> able<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.930> conceal

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
because you want to be able to conceal

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.589 
because you want to be able to conceal
the<00:04:01.470> screw<00:04:01.739> heads<00:04:01.950> easily

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.809 

that's<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.530> last<00:04:08.709> of<00:04:08.860> my<00:04:08.920> cladding<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.400> but

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
that's the last of my cladding on but

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.089 
that's the last of my cladding on but
looks<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.750> bit<00:04:10.780> average<00:04:11.200> at<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.469> moment<00:04:11.769> I'm

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
looks a bit average at the moment I'm

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.709 
looks a bit average at the moment I'm
going<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.340> fix<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:12.790> one<00:04:13.209> last<00:04:13.450> bit<00:04:13.689> of

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
going to fix that with one last bit of

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.390 
going to fix that with one last bit of
decking<00:04:14.140> I'll<00:04:14.290> put<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.829> along<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.159> front

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
decking I'll put it along the front

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.509 
decking I'll put it along the front
underneath<00:04:15.879> here<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.769> around<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.949> sides<00:04:18.220> and

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
underneath here and around the sides and

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.460 
underneath here and around the sides and
that<00:04:19.000> will<00:04:19.060> make<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.479> look<00:04:19.630> like<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.079> bench

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
that will make it look like the bench

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.560 
that will make it look like the bench
seat<00:04:20.769> is<00:04:20.919> completely<00:04:21.459> integrated<00:04:21.729> into<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
seat is completely integrated into the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.689 
seat is completely integrated into the
base<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.350> my<00:04:23.500> last<00:04:23.710> trick<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.190> conceal<00:04:24.550> the

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
base and my last trick to conceal the

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.629 
base and my last trick to conceal the
corners<00:04:25.229> aluminium<00:04:26.229> angle<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:27.220> angles<00:04:27.520> not

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
corners aluminium angle the angles not

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.129 
corners aluminium angle the angles not
structural<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.449> just<00:04:28.600> fix<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:28.960> place

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
structural so I can just fix it in place

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.020 
structural so I can just fix it in place
with<00:04:29.289> my<00:04:29.320> magic<00:04:29.740> construction<00:04:30.250> adhesive<00:04:30.400> it's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
with my magic construction adhesive it's

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.640 
with my magic construction adhesive it's
high-tech<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.690> will<00:04:31.810> hold<00:04:31.960> firmly<00:04:32.229> while<00:04:32.500> it
