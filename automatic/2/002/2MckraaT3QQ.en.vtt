00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 with the narrowest of margins given 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.700
 Cossack boys last Saturday 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 victory over Noordwijk after another one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.420
 blurry start in a home game 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.670
 the workers from work already looked at fifteen minutes 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.769
 against 0 2 deficit so 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.289
 Incomprehensible way I have the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.250
 Chairman are not Marquis 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.660
 underestimate that is just from one 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.010
 angry in the top class 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.449
 There the teams are good for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 have seen a team again today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.180
 which is at the bottom or at the bottom 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.529
 just good football too and strength as 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 a few hands just very difficult 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 can make 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.489
 absolutely when you see how he is one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 start a race that's really real 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.770
 bizarre and also make very stupid choices 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 then be punished by Noordwijk 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.050
 but again the character shown and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 First, a good choir in the making 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course happy fast to in between 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 two two and finally you hear anyway 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.930
 still promised in the world 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 in the run-up to the game against hhc 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.010
 Hardenberg from next Saturday 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.210
 Cossack boys TV with leon bid 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720

 next year it is already my 5th 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.880

 yes there are still plans to move on 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.720
 to make up 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 Not in he affections we look 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.030

 from the second grade I am alice sea 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.250
 gone that the last year of the real 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.930
 main class, so to speak 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 To this end, I have been given the option here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.950
 to go it was in the past 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.390
 already in the outings in sliedrecht also yes 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 I had the opportunity to go here 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.120
 go and then I have not done yet 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.310
 and then I have the third time the 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.420
 possibility to was then I have one 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 done and I have no regrets 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.190
 so I 'm happy but I'm sitting 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020
 have some problems with an injury you read 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.000
 research of what goes with it 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.979
 yes i have its outcome tomorrow 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.649
 actually I top one for a few months 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.390
 bit with just problems and yes it is 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.740
 has come to the point that it is quite a lot 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.410
 is going to be annoying during it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.660
 can also train during the games 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.100
 no i can't play with the fear yes 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.380
 which is just difficult with a long ball 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.640
 of shooting and that he is in it 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.470
 just so much that I do the investigations 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.410
 do plates and I gave a scan 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.970
 This morning I have the result so I hope 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.250
 that I don't know anything more about it 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.450
 tomorrow and hopefully I can get rid of it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.100
 come soon 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.560
 next Saturday stands out the well 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.000
 against HHC Hardenberg on the program 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.680
 last season, the game ended in 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.970
 hardenberg in a one 3 victory for 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.560
 the working people 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.270
 an early goal from experience one 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.200
 beautiful distance shot by sjoerd 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.390
 van der waal 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.340
 han and leia that are comfortable and delicious 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.810
 van der waal and really 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.970
 leading goal of is millions of belt 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.580
 the Cossack boys delivered the three points 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.590
 but that has come forward 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.430
 because of course everything plays there 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.400
 or nothing 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.380
 and so it's going to be a 3 by now 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.180
 ismael three here 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.590
 and he does it this way last 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.000
 season the cossacks were in hardenberg 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.709
 supported by a myriad of supporters 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 a large part with the special 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.120
 party bus to the east had traveled 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 this party bus will also find this season 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.329
 leave hardenberg 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.340
 also the supporters of hc guarantee 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.320
 for atmosphere and already have some atmosphere 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.239
 promotions announced 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.310
 this season it was working with 2 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.900
 four lost to hc &amp; h the road 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.880
 Cossack boys came through Benjamin Martha 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.620
 still early in the lead but looked 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.549
 with the rest against a 3 behind 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.170
 to 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 after rest the hosts did come 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.769
 back through you dream 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.060
 but it was eventually sargon gouriye 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.970
 who decided the game completely 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.739
 hhc hardenberg had the bad one in 2013 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.760
 period in which the five games on 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.470
 lost row 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.270
 thanks to a strong series of six matches 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.920
 without loss of which five 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.200
 Profit classes had the somewhere 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.430
 now in third place with only 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 five points behind could catch on 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720
 boys is all about this 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.040
 late next Saturday 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.480
 shrink 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.730
 for Cossack boys, on the other hand, one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.780
 ultimate opportunity to compete with a close one 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.310
 to set a sideline 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.530
 it 's an important competition is one 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.540
 direct competitor and you need the courage 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.030
 don't lose them a house out of five 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.370
 points but we never go for a point 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.070
 to a team when we stuff 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.359
 our trusted away game and where we 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.630
 win almost everything 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.250
 so curious how that how it matters 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.229
 is going 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.940
 but yes that is really a team 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.360
 whole football and then we get some more 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.210
 space 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.860
 so I just don't have expectations now 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.120
 to go she it is just really against me 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.300
 perhaps the most difficult reason is already there 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.800
 is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.030
 for us it would be just me 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.020
 most important thing is not to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.950
 then you just pay yourself 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.010
 ahead of hardenberg 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.669
 and then hope you yes the other what 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.650
 has a favorable result and would simply 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.400
 Google is trying to create you and you 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.930
 main 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.820
 c will do anything to make us 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.080
 you can win if we were there 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.270
 to win then you also put one on eight 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.640
 points then there might still be one 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.020
 live a little but if you lose 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.820
 slower again three or four shifts 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.960
 you go so see it every week is still 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.430
 exciting 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.050
 as long as you keep winning yourself 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.550
 we always have a good weekend yes last year 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.020
 I think it was a nice match 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.320
 of the season days we are with one 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.789
 3 and with the audience of both teams 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.330
 was very excited to make the 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.770
 competition very nice and we won there 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.180
 definitely follow me something but also with one 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.760
 beautiful header in the last minute 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.370
 that game and hopefully it goes 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.930
 just like last year one 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.610
 yes we do not shake for provisional 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.960
 Hardenberg also from Allah can be a dream 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.270
 let's hope it is like this 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.410
 long hold on and really yes it would 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.600
 beautiful if we just go 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.669
 save his dream and I also think he 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.500
 that it came true at the end of it 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.270
 season with cossack boys smith my 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.740
