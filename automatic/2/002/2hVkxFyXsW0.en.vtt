00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 Greetings to all and welcome to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.570
 favorite segment of many in sports 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 telemundo dotcom 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.670
 reality or fantasy a new week there 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 some new jesse themes that we put as 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
 It is usual for our consideration 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.670
 public in sports telemundo dotcom and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 we start with fantasy football or 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.689
 reality that chivas can still 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.970
 qualify to the liguilla 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 good mathematically is a reality 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 watching it football is a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.290
 fantasy have been left with just 16 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 points it is true that 9 remain in dispute 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.519
 but the guadalajara has this end of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.870
 week the classic Guadalajara in the stadium 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.530
 jalisco in front of the back that is the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.449
 sub - leader of this tournament closes- 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.220
 close visiting the soccer champion 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.260
 Mexican is just that it may reach its 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.089
 last day with the need to add 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 and win the match to classify the 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.659
 group and in the meantime on the screen 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.280
 of Telemundo will play in front of the 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.100
 white roosters of querÃ©taro that could 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 be the option that on paper looks 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.549
 more feasible considering that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.360
 perhaps querÃ©taro for the penultimate date 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:09.150
 already mathematically descended can 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 be without doubt a fantasy to think that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 I can classify 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.240
 yes but we already know how this is handled 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.610
 theme of the points in the tournament closing 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
 of Mexican football and maybe you can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 become a happy reality for the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 fans of the Guadalajara team 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 let's talk about fantasy reality boxing 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.270
 can win or without point fraud if 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.040
 is that the fight is over the end to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.870
 canelo in san antonio 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 that's a very good question have they done 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.960
 many amateurs I think that you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.970
 it would be quite difficult to win for points 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 given the great fervor that will be in the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.070
 cotton for this fight in over 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 40,000 fans after they add 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.800
 some seats that had promised 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 add before the fight almost all go 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.820
 to be Hispanic everyone will be in favor 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.770
 of the canelo Ã¡lvarez 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.270
 and on the other hand already in the past 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 historically we have seen some 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 decisions a little bit weird there in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.390
 texas nothing against the commission of 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 texas ni of the Texans but in boxing 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.910
 things sometimes are like this it seems to me that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.300
 to the central almost almost more bound to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 make a victory 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.010
 knockout to win a unanimous decision 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.080
 that is a bit stuck because out there 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.180
 is where things get complicated and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.940
 suddenly a divided decision appears a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.770
 majority draw in the end there are many 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 things that can save the situation a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.820
 decision that can be controversial now 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.350
 know that if he wants us to play any 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.790
 of the topics that you propose 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.890
