00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.280
 the time to collect the toads what 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:18.880
 we will know when they are totally 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.230
 brown because the leaves have dried in 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.599
 we can see that there are still some 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 green part but it's practically the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:29.100
 appropriate time to collect the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.020
 if we do that is not my case because I 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.820
 I have had them without applying the risks 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.820
 none of us are doing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.280
 the leaves yellowing a little bit would be the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 appropriate time to cut the risk 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 of not applying more this form the adjustment 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.910
 between the flavor and we also invite you to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.780
 summit point 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.330
 that can be found below 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.329
 provoke as I say rottenness that 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.190
 affect 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 why irrigation will be cut 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.490
 approximately one month or three weeks 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.680
 before 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 that we are going to collect those garlic 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.210
 from the moment of collection and as I say 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 the most appropriate moment will be when 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.909
 start looking at the green color of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.909
 leaves 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.450
 another thing we can do to 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.149
 accelerate or to gain weight in crossing the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.049
 head of the garlic hear it 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.780
 this is not found like this or regarding 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.200
 the airs of the strong one hundred but because 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.280
 I would be crushing or you can cut 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:49.580
 even with the hand 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:51.310
 so that in this way the teeth of 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.840
 Garlic 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 the nutrients stay in the part 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.430
 aerial that does not develop that part of 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.040
 even wider air and cause this 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.070
 injury 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 in this part of the plant the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
 nutrients will be retained in the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 underground part will disburse even more 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.660
 the heads to get them out and I eat you 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.600
 I just said 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.220
 did not apply irrigation means that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.540
 last rains were two three 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 weeks 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.040
 the water has practically evaporated 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 of the land and this land is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.819
 very dry and I also have the difficulty of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.219
 that a soil is a bit strong and 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.620
 drying gets very compact and stays 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.510
 very hard 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 therefore there will be that we are careful 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 special now when it comes to extracting 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.540
 these these garlics and I'm going to help in 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 this case of a sweetener that serves 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.750
 to plant could also help 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 offers a small 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.000
 I made a little behind 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 as I say use in pot 2 and what 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 I'm going to do is going to be a few centimeters 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.230
 of the head 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.010
 and prick the reel and pry 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.880
 to tackle the terrain a bit 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.460
 in this way 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240
 Without damaging 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.300
 the production 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.830
 we facilitate its extraction 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.100
 as you see some heads of a size 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.830
 acceptable to keep in mind that this is 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.920
 a garlic from the area is not a garlic 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.130
 Chinese of these that are so great 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.810
 the elephants garlic and that's why this size 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.140
 of head is quite acceptable other 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.319
 thing that by avoiding watering and when extracting 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.800
 on the head with dry soil 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.800
 we facilitate a cleaning 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:54.060
 it stays clean very much before 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.060
 Well, the moment we take them out 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.100
 and let's go 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.010
 depositing in the field so that the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.480
 low humidity 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.480
 that they can retain 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.190
 they release it as the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.160
 time we will make sure we have looked 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.769
 meteorological part to avoid that 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.010
 let's take out the basses we protect a couple of 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.010
 days 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.900
 and the storm fell and what we are 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.200
 trying to avoid rotting by 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.370
 excess moisture 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.830
 Well, we are going to have that possibility 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.660
 because they get wet with some storm 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.660
 that can bring in these dates 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.430
 bear in mind also that these years have 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.340
 been planted at a density of 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.190
 planting very reduced many years by 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.050
 square meter and heads despite 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.050
 it does not have a bad size 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.510
 we cleaned them a little 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.190
 and let them finish drying in 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.190
 the very terrain where they have been raised 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.629
 now another thing that I wanted him to see and 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.370
 how to go 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.830
 these garlic 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.050
 I said they are planted at a density 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:20.340
 of plants quite elevated 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.340
 and I want you to check them 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.300
 as you better compare with those who 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.789
 I have on the bench 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.050
 is there next to it and yes it 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.870
 they have been planted with a density 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.720
 very much wider and therefore the 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.870
 development is going to be a little bit bigger 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.670
 we'll see 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.970
 the eyes of this other bench that 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.970
 we have 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.720
 let's see the situation this other other 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.560
 banking 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.370
 as you see 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.870
 the dam of 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.980
 the difference in size 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.980
 in the heads to others 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.220
 the depression that I want to do or 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.680
 is that maybe it's interesting to have a 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.740
 greater concentration of plants 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.780
 surface because although we have heads 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.750
 smaller, we have a greater number of 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.240
 amount of garlic that having heads of 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.370
 much larger but with less 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.700
 plants per square meter 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.470
 I hope you find it useful is 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.500
 my final conclusion 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.260
 I hope you have no problems with this 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.560
 I cultivate a greeting and until the next 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.560
 video
