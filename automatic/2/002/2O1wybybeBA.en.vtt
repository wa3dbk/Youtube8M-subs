00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
their back you'll see in the video one
of<00:00:33.690> us<00:00:33.840> testing<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> make<00:00:34.500> sure<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.800> placed

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
of us testing to make sure it's placed

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.770 
of us testing to make sure it's placed
and<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.399> reads<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.390> pets<00:00:36.600> at

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and it reads so just like your pets at

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
and it reads so just like your pets at
home<00:00:36.890> microchip<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.280> you're

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
home microchip them that way you're

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
home microchip them that way you're
always<00:00:38.520> sure<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.030> animal<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:39.600> checking

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
always sure which animal you're checking

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900 
always sure which animal you're checking
and<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.860> get<00:00:40.980> older<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> change

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and as they get older and they change

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
and as they get older and they change
physically<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.690> gonna<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.989> might<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> harder

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
physically it's gonna be might be harder

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
physically it's gonna be might be harder
to<00:00:43.620> tell<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.010> apart<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.390> way

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to tell them apart so that's a good way

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760 
to tell them apart so that's a good way
to<00:00:45.570> make<00:00:45.780> sure<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.050> know<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:46.350> animal

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to make sure you know which animal

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.049 
to make sure you know which animal
you're<00:00:46.890> dealing<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.579> medical<00:00:47.940> records

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you're dealing with for medical records

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
you're dealing with for medical records
and<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.250> we<00:00:50.250> also<00:00:50.460> did<00:00:50.850> gender

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and things like that we also did gender

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
and things like that we also did gender
checks<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.110> finally<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> gender<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
checks so we finally know the gender of

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.270 
checks so we finally know the gender of
each<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:53.910> Cubs<00:00:54.239> we've<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.379> three<00:00:55.649> girls<00:00:56.010> a

he's the only man in the Lion House

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
he's the only man in the Lion House
right<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.469> he's<00:01:01.739> okay<00:01:02.039> with

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
right now but I'm sure he's okay with
that<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.510> weigh<00:01:03.660> each<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> Cubs

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that we got to weigh each of the Cubs

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
that we got to weigh each of the Cubs
everyone's<00:01:05.309> weighing<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.850> roughly<00:01:06.150> nine

and<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> half<00:01:06.659> kilograms<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> translates

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and a half kilograms so that translates

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
and a half kilograms so that translates
to<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.580> 20<00:01:08.909> pounds<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.840> good<00:01:10.049> solid

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
to about 20 pounds which are good solid
weights<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.040> hefty<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.670> Cubs

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
weights we have good hefty little Cubs

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.399 
weights we have good hefty little Cubs
everyone's<00:01:12.330> eating<00:01:12.510> well<00:01:12.780> that's<00:01:13.110> right

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
everyone's eating well that's right

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
everyone's eating well that's right
where<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.650> should<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:14.010> at<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> age<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.820> very

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
where they should be at this age so very

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
where they should be at this age so very
healthy<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.619> bit<00:01:16.770> challenging

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
healthy it's a little bit challenging

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
healthy it's a little bit challenging
handling<00:01:17.700> them<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.390> we've<00:01:18.570> said

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
handling them because as we've said

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
handling them because as we've said
leading<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> point<00:01:19.799> we've<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.100> very

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
leading up to this point we've been very

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
leading up to this point we've been very
hands-off<00:01:20.970> we've<00:01:21.240> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> wanted<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
hands-off we've kind of wanted them to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
hands-off we've kind of wanted them to
have<00:01:22.560> time<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> bond<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.280> Amani<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.119> be

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
have time to bond with Amani and just be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
have time to bond with Amani and just be
little<00:01:24.390> lions<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:25.950> time

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little lions so this was the first time

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
little lions so this was the first time
that<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.640> were<00:01:26.700> ever<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.810> being

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that they were ever really kind of being

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.870 
that they were ever really kind of being
handled<00:01:28.710> by<00:01:28.799> humans<00:01:29.280> before<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
handled by humans before so it was a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219 
handled by humans before so it was a
little<00:01:29.970> confusing<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.049> bit
