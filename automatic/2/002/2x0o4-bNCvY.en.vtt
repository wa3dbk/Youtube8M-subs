found<00:00:11.840> an<00:00:11.960> interesting<00:00:12.170> problem<00:00:12.559> on<00:00:12.980> Andy's

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
found an interesting problem on Andy's

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.960 
found an interesting problem on Andy's
mx6<00:00:14.269> kld<00:00:15.260> II<00:00:15.290> he<00:00:15.830> had<00:00:15.860> a<00:00:16.040> parasitic<00:00:16.730> drain

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
mx6 kld II he had a parasitic drain

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.179 
mx6 kld II he had a parasitic drain
where<00:00:17.270> when<00:00:17.660> leaving<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.110> car<00:00:18.320> sitting<00:00:18.980> out

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
where when leaving the car sitting out

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.940 
where when leaving the car sitting out
overnight<00:00:19.580> it<00:00:20.180> would<00:00:20.509> drain<00:00:21.110> itself<00:00:21.439> maybe

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
overnight it would drain itself maybe

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.830 
overnight it would drain itself maybe
two<00:00:22.220> days<00:00:22.400> right<00:00:22.670> something<00:00:23.420> like<00:00:23.540> that<00:00:23.689> two

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
two days right something like that two

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.870 
two days right something like that two
days<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.680> battery<00:00:24.950> would<00:00:25.130> drain<00:00:25.369> couldn't

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
days the battery would drain couldn't

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.300 
days the battery would drain couldn't
figure<00:00:26.000> out<00:00:26.119> why<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:26.810> we<00:00:26.990> go<00:00:27.110> in<00:00:27.320> we<00:00:27.980> do<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
figure out why so we go in we do the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.549 
figure out why so we go in we do the
standard<00:00:28.640> parasitic<00:00:29.239> drain<00:00:29.450> test<00:00:29.869> which<00:00:30.380> is

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
standard parasitic drain test which is

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.260 
standard parasitic drain test which is
to<00:00:30.800> hook<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.390> probes<00:00:32.390> up<00:00:32.599> in<00:00:32.809> series<00:00:33.200> like

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
to hook the probes up in series like

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.520 
to hook the probes up in series like
that<00:00:35.620> okay<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:36.770> then<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:37.700> look<00:00:37.880> on<00:00:38.090> for<00:00:38.840> you

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
that okay and then you look on for you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.110 
that okay and then you look on for you
look<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.800> your<00:00:39.920> multimeter<00:00:40.250> for<00:00:40.610> an<00:00:40.730> amp<00:00:40.880> draw

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
look on your multimeter for an amp draw

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.900 
look on your multimeter for an amp draw
and<00:00:41.750> we<00:00:41.899> were<00:00:41.989> getting<00:00:42.140> almost<00:00:42.530> 2<00:00:43.129> amps<00:00:43.489> with

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
and we were getting almost 2 amps with

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.579 
and we were getting almost 2 amps with
all<00:00:44.179> the<00:00:44.359> fuses<00:00:44.719> and<00:00:44.870> everything<00:00:45.230> connected

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
all the fuses and everything connected

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.810 
all the fuses and everything connected
we<00:00:45.649> were<00:00:45.739> getting<00:00:45.980> higher<00:00:46.160> than<00:00:46.370> 2<00:00:46.489> amps<00:00:46.699> to

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
we were getting higher than 2 amps to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.389 
we were getting higher than 2 amps to
point<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.210> total<00:00:47.870> max<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.739> point<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.100> let's

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
point to total max to point to let's

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.860 
point to total max to point to let's
connect<00:00:49.699> this<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.239> we'll<00:00:50.390> start<00:00:50.480> pulling

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
connect this up and we'll start pulling

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.500 
connect this up and we'll start pulling
fuses<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.589> pulled<00:00:51.829> all<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.249> fuses<00:00:52.640> every

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
fuses so we pulled all the fuses every

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.009 
fuses so we pulled all the fuses every
single<00:00:54.230> fuse<00:00:54.499> out<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.609> joint<00:00:56.089> box<00:00:56.359> in<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
single fuse out of the joint box in the

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.750 
single fuse out of the joint box in the
interior<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.679> cabin<00:00:57.829> did<00:00:58.249> not<00:00:58.429> change

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
interior of the cabin did not change

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.450 
interior of the cabin did not change
still<00:00:59.359> getting<00:00:59.629> a<00:00:59.719> high<00:01:00.350> amp<00:01:00.530> draw<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:00.980> think<00:01:01.399> I

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
still getting a high amp draw I think I

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.309 
still getting a high amp draw I think I
dropped<00:01:01.699> down<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.879> 1.8<00:01:02.480> something<00:01:02.929> but<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:03.289> was

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
dropped down to 1.8 something but it was

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.649 
dropped down to 1.8 something but it was
still<00:01:03.620> way<00:01:04.070> way<00:01:04.100> too<00:01:04.550> high<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.909> should<00:01:05.030> get<00:01:05.269> 50

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
still way way too high you should get 50

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.270 
still way way too high you should get 50
milliamps<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.409> then<00:01:06.560> next<00:01:06.800> we<00:01:07.010> went<00:01:07.190> out

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
milliamps and so then next we went out

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.840 
milliamps and so then next we went out
the<00:01:07.370> fuse<00:01:07.580> box<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:09.710> pulled<00:01:09.950> every<00:01:10.340> single<00:01:10.640> fuse

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
the fuse box we pulled every single fuse

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.120 
the fuse box we pulled every single fuse
in<00:01:11.000> every<00:01:11.270> single<00:01:11.450> relay<00:01:11.870> including<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.650> 100

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130

amp<00:01:13.310> main<00:01:13.550> and<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:14.300> did<00:01:14.510> not<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.810> away<00:01:15.080> remove

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
amp main and it did not go away remove

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.500 
amp main and it did not go away remove
the<00:01:15.680> 100<00:01:16.130> amp<00:01:16.310> main<00:01:16.610> in<00:01:16.820> order<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.120> remove<00:01:17.330> the

the 100 amp main in order to remove the
100<00:01:17.990> amp<00:01:18.140> main<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.710> different<00:01:19.160> than<00:01:19.280> all

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
100 amp main it is different than all

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.800 
100 amp main it is different than all
the<00:01:19.460> other<00:01:19.700> fuses<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.450> remove<00:01:20.630> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
the other fuses you have to remove the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.560 
the other fuses you have to remove the
fuse<00:01:20.990> box<00:01:21.140> lay<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.500> over<00:01:21.700> get<00:01:22.700> at<00:01:22.910> these<00:01:23.180> two

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.260 
fuse box lay it over get at these two
connections<00:01:24.110> because<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.190> 100<00:01:25.640> amp<00:01:25.820> main<00:01:26.060> is

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
connections because the 100 amp main is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.230 
connections because the 100 amp main is
screwed<00:01:26.750> down<00:01:27.050> once<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.040> get<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.340> out<00:01:28.400> then

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
screwed down once you get that out then

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.240 
screwed down once you get that out then
we<00:01:29.420> jumpered<00:01:29.960> across<00:01:30.740> these<00:01:30.980> two<00:01:31.220> terminals

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
we jumpered across these two terminals

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.880 
we jumpered across these two terminals
to<00:01:32.060> see<00:01:32.240> our<00:01:32.390> amp<00:01:32.600> draw<00:01:32.840> our<00:01:33.080> amp<00:01:33.290> draw<00:01:33.470> was<00:01:33.740> on

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
to see our amp draw our amp draw was on

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.350 
to see our amp draw our amp draw was on
the<00:01:34.040> main<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.550> was<00:01:34.670> going<00:01:34.910> through<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.180> main

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.510 
100 amp fuse 2 amps through the 102 s
okay<00:01:38.870> so<00:01:39.230> it's<00:01:39.410> not<00:01:39.590> anything<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.280> do<00:01:40.340> with<00:01:40.370> the

fuse box it's not anything to do with
the<00:01:41.990> internal<00:01:42.260> fuse<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:42.770> has<00:01:43.010> to<00:01:43.190> be<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.300 
to the alternator the wiring diagrams
only<00:01:53.450> showed<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.140> made<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.770> 100<00:01:55.190> amp

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
only showed that that made that 100 amp

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.980 
only showed that that made that 100 amp
man<00:01:55.490> goes<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.970> charging<00:01:56.420> system<00:01:56.600> and

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
man goes to the charging system and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.090 
man goes to the charging system and
what's<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.350> charging<00:01:57.710> system<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
what's in the charging system the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.530 
what's in the charging system the
alternator<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> only<00:01:59.060> thing<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.390> goes

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
alternator and the only thing that goes

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.270 
alternator and the only thing that goes
from<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.140> alternator<00:02:00.500> there's<00:02:00.950> two<00:02:01.100> wires

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
from the alternator there's two wires

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.980 
from the alternator there's two wires
one<00:02:01.460> goes<00:02:01.880> straight<00:02:02.210> up<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:02.570> instrument

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
one goes straight up to the instrument

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.720 
one goes straight up to the instrument
cluster<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.890> since<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.190> pulled<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.520> meter

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
cluster and since we pulled the meter

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.760 
cluster and since we pulled the meter
fuse<00:02:05.030> inside<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.870> instrument<00:02:06.320> cluster<00:02:06.590> bulb

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
fuse inside that instrument cluster bulb

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.219 
fuse inside that instrument cluster bulb
is<00:02:06.920> not<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.610> do<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.690> 2<00:02:08.869> amp<00:02:09.050> draw

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
is not going to do the the 2 amp draw

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.860 
is not going to do the the 2 amp draw
alright<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:09.890> those<00:02:10.039> wires<00:02:10.660> one<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.780> those

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
alright so those wires one of those

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.900 
alright so those wires one of those
wires<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.319> think<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.830> white<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.610> green

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
wires I think it's the white in green

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.369 
wires I think it's the white in green
goes<00:02:14.180> up<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.569> instrument<00:02:14.959> cluster<00:02:15.019> and

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
goes up to the instrument cluster and

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.440 
goes up to the instrument cluster and
then<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> other<00:02:15.709> one<00:02:15.920> goes<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.940> voltage

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
then the other one goes to the voltage

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.809 
then the other one goes to the voltage
regulator<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.830> voltage<00:02:19.159> regulator<00:02:19.579> is

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
regulator and the voltage regulator is

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.059 
regulator and the voltage regulator is
also<00:02:20.480> powered<00:02:20.840> by<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.049> egi<00:02:21.469> main<00:02:22.129> relay

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
also powered by the egi main relay

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.949 
also powered by the egi main relay
since<00:02:23.249> all<00:02:23.519> these<00:02:23.939> fuses<00:02:24.420> were<00:02:24.540> already

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
since all these fuses were already

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.080 
since all these fuses were already
pulled<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.499> we<00:02:25.769> know<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.189> not<00:02:26.430> due<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.999> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
pulled out we know it's not due to the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
pulled out we know it's not due to the
voltage<00:02:27.389> regulator<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.079> we're<00:02:28.379> still<00:02:28.590> getting

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
voltage regulator so we're still getting

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.160 
voltage regulator so we're still getting
a<00:02:28.920> 2<00:02:29.159> amp<00:02:29.310> draw<00:02:29.609> on<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.239> alternator<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.079> we

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
a 2 amp draw on the alternator so we

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229 
a 2 amp draw on the alternator so we
pulled<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.590> post<00:02:31.859> off<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.790> alternator

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
pulled the post off of the alternator

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.599 
pulled the post off of the alternator
and<00:02:33.329> sure<00:02:33.659> enough<00:02:33.689> that<00:02:34.409> 2<00:02:34.680> amp<00:02:34.859> draw<00:02:35.129> went

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
and sure enough that 2 amp draw went

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:36.500 
and sure enough that 2 amp draw went
bye-bye

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
bye-bye

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
bye-bye
order<00:02:36.810> new<00:02:36.989> lead<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.439> then<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.069> dropped<00:02:38.310> down

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
order new lead and then it dropped down

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.309 
order new lead and then it dropped down
to<00:02:38.489> 40<00:02:38.939> milliamps<00:02:39.389> which<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.689> perfectly

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
to 40 milliamps which is perfectly

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 
to 40 milliamps which is perfectly
within<00:02:40.650> spec<00:02:41.219> so<00:02:41.489> we<00:02:41.670> know<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:42.120> he's<00:02:42.359> got<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
within spec so we know that he's got a

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.140 
within spec so we know that he's got a
problem<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:43.200> his<00:02:43.709> alternator<00:02:44.430> somehow

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
problem with his alternator somehow

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.660 
problem with his alternator somehow
someway<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:46.200> alternator<00:02:46.739> more<00:02:47.340> than<00:02:47.489> likely

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
someway the alternator more than likely

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
someway the alternator more than likely
my<00:02:48.000> guess<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.389> bad<00:02:48.840> diode<00:02:49.439> rectifier<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:50.280> is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
my guess a bad diode rectifier that is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.399 
my guess a bad diode rectifier that is
allowing<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.150> battery<00:02:51.450> voltage<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:52.049> drain

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
allowing the battery voltage to drain

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.589 
allowing the battery voltage to drain
back<00:02:52.439> into<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.430> alternator<00:02:54.090> when<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.389> car<00:02:54.569> is

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
back into the alternator when the car is

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.629 
back into the alternator when the car is
off<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.349> diode<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.189> one-way<00:02:56.609> check

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
off that's a diode is a one-way check

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.970 
off that's a diode is a one-way check
valve<00:02:56.879> that<00:02:57.269> only<00:02:57.659> allows<00:02:58.049> voltage<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.829> go

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
valve that only allows voltage to go

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.250 
valve that only allows voltage to go
from<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.669> alternator<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.599> battery<00:03:00.900> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
from the alternator to the battery to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.099 
from the alternator to the battery to
recharge<00:03:01.469> it<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.639> going<00:03:02.909> back<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.840> way

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
recharge it but it's going back that way

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.599 
recharge it but it's going back that way
when<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.500> car<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.829> off<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.280> should<00:03:05.489> not

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
when the car is off and it should not

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.250 
when the car is off and it should not
happen<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:06.239> we're<00:03:06.449> looking<00:03:06.689> at<00:03:06.840> possibly

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
happen so we're looking at possibly

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.250 
happen so we're looking at possibly
blown<00:03:08.250> diode<00:03:08.549> rectifier<00:03:08.870> inside<00:03:09.870> the

there<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:31.400> brake<00:03:33.049> degreaser<00:03:34.049> yeah

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
there with some brake degreaser yeah

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.199 
there with some brake degreaser yeah
with<00:03:34.620> some<00:03:34.650> mono<00:03:35.489> actually<00:03:35.849> i<00:03:35.879> you<00:03:35.939> thought

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
with some mono actually i you thought

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.969 
with some mono actually i you thought
about<00:03:36.389> I<00:03:36.599> used<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.229> was<00:03:37.349> way<00:03:37.530> better

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
about I used a that was way better

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.319 
about I used a that was way better
well<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> throttle<00:03:38.729> body<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.909> get<00:03:39.060> off<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
well the throttle body to get off the

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.969 
well the throttle body to get off the
grease<00:03:39.509> initially<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.229> you<00:03:40.560> don't<00:03:40.769> want<00:03:40.919> to

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
grease initially but you don't want to

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.520 
grease initially but you don't want to
use<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.129> for<00:03:41.579> long<00:03:41.729> because<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.169> hurt

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
use that for long because it can hurt

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.469 
use that for long because it can hurt
rubber<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.129> seals<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.639> stuff<00:03:44.849> like<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
rubber and seals and stuff like that so

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.749 
rubber and seals and stuff like that so
I<00:03:45.780> clean<00:03:46.319> up<00:03:46.409> really<00:03:46.590> good<00:03:46.799> yeah<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.639> looks

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
I clean up really good yeah it looks

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.119 
I clean up really good yeah it looks
great<00:03:47.879> but<00:03:48.479> yeah<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> do<00:03:49.079> have<00:03:49.319> an<00:03:49.409> oil<00:03:49.680> leak<00:03:49.859> as

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
great but yeah I do have an oil leak as

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.469 
great but yeah I do have an oil leak as
you<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.579> right<00:03:50.759> there<00:03:50.819> valve<00:03:51.299> cover

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
you can see right there valve cover

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.890 
you can see right there valve cover
gasket<00:03:51.840> yeah<00:03:52.530> everything<00:03:53.370> gasket<00:03:53.729> leak<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
gasket yeah everything gasket leak the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.469 
gasket yeah everything gasket leak the
point<00:03:55.139> is<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:56.129> an<00:03:56.400> oil<00:03:56.669> leak<00:03:56.849> in<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.299> hole

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
point is I have an oil leak in the hole

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.229 
point is I have an oil leak in the hole
alternators<00:03:58.319> core<00:03:58.650> with<00:03:58.829> oil<00:03:59.150> externally<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
alternators core with oil externally and

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
alternators core with oil externally and
I'm<00:04:00.359> sure<00:04:00.599> internally<00:04:01.169> he<00:04:01.739> goes<00:04:01.949> right<00:04:02.099> in

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
I'm sure internally he goes right in

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.129 
I'm sure internally he goes right in
there<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.609> I'm<00:04:02.970> sure<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.689> fact<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.930> there's

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
there so I'm sure the fact that there's

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.920 
there so I'm sure the fact that there's
oil<00:04:04.379> inside<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.949> alternator<00:04:05.400> or<00:04:06.329> driven<00:04:06.689> into

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
oil inside the alternator or driven into

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.680 
oil inside the alternator or driven into
the<00:04:07.019> alternator

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.240 

most<00:04:10.690> likely<00:04:10.960> has<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> major<00:04:11.790> impact<00:04:12.790> on

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
most likely has a major impact on

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.430 
most likely has a major impact on
something<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.870> engineer<00:04:16.870> that<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.110> actually

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
something that engineer that is actually

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.940 
something that engineer that is actually
broken<00:04:17.650> or<00:04:18.810> malfunctioning<00:04:19.810> that's<00:04:20.620> actually

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
broken or malfunctioning that's actually

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.010 
broken or malfunctioning that's actually
drawing<00:04:21.220> us<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.549> amp<00:04:21.760> maybe<00:04:22.240> contributing<00:04:22.870> the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
drawing us to amp maybe contributing the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.600 
drawing us to amp maybe contributing the
overheating<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.890> alternator<00:04:24.370> which

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
overheating of the alternator which

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.100 
overheating of the alternator which
burned<00:04:24.910> out<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.300> diode<00:04:25.600> rectifier<00:04:25.750> or

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
burned out the diode rectifier or

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.560 
burned out the diode rectifier or
something<00:04:26.590> like<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.770> high<00:04:27.220> resistance<00:04:27.850> but

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
something like that high resistance but

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.630 
something like that high resistance but
yeah<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.230> got<00:04:29.410> oil<00:04:29.680> leaks<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.190> I'm<00:04:30.340> sure<00:04:30.520> that

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
yeah I got oil leaks and I'm sure that

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.270 
yeah I got oil leaks and I'm sure that
doesn't<00:04:30.790> help<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:32.110> now<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:32.530> know<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.890> the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
doesn't help so now we know is that the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.740 
doesn't help so now we know is that the
alternator<00:04:33.760> that's<00:04:33.970> drawing<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:35.280> two<00:04:36.280> amps

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
alternator that's drawing the two amps

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.360 
alternator that's drawing the two amps
when<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.870> car<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.380> turn<00:04:38.530> off<00:04:38.710> that's<00:04:39.250> the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
when the car is to turn off that's the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.810 
when the car is to turn off that's the
problem

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820

running it's at eleven point eight five
with<00:05:44.520> all<00:05:44.670> loads<00:05:44.940> on<00:05:45.180> his<00:05:45.690> alternator<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.680> shot

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
with all loads on his alternator is shot

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.690 
with all loads on his alternator is shot
time<00:05:47.280> for<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.520> new<00:05:47.700> alternator<00:05:48.120> with<00:05:48.810> with<00:05:49.320> gas

time for a new alternator with with gas

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.940 
time for a new alternator with with gas
eleven<00:05:50.700> point<00:05:50.940> eight<00:05:51.030> nine

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.970 

charge<00:05:54.580> light<00:05:54.820> turns<00:05:55.090> off

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.410 

-<00:05:58.310> gasps<00:05:58.490> see

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
- gasps see

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.300 
- gasps see
and<00:05:59.660> it<00:05:59.810> should<00:06:00.020> slowly<00:06:00.350> decline<00:06:00.890> with<00:06:01.160> all

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
and it should slowly decline with all

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.280 
and it should slowly decline with all
the<00:06:01.460> loads<00:06:01.670> back<00:06:01.940> on<00:06:02.120> 12.2<00:06:02.780> now<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.080> light

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
the loads back on 12.2 now the light

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.150 
the loads back on 12.2 now the light
comes<00:06:03.500> back<00:06:03.680> on<00:06:04.600> that<00:06:05.600> is<00:06:05.780> how<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.110> diagnose<00:06:06.950> a

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
comes back on that is how to diagnose a

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.469 
comes back on that is how to diagnose a
bad<00:06:07.400> alternator

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.830 

yeah<00:06:11.370> so<00:06:12.370> this<00:06:12.729> is<00:06:12.909> more<00:06:13.180> of<00:06:13.240> a<00:06:13.300> continuous

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
yeah so this is more of a continuous

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.269 
yeah so this is more of a continuous
this<00:06:13.960> is<00:06:14.110> going<00:06:14.259> to<00:06:14.319> be<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:14.529> end<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.009> video

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279 
this is going to be the end of the video

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.959 
this is going to be the end of the video
from<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.759> earlier<00:06:16.120> video<00:06:16.449> of<00:06:16.749> the<00:06:16.990> alternator

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
from the earlier video of the alternator

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.209 
from the earlier video of the alternator
parasitic<00:06:18.969> draw<00:06:19.499> alternator<00:06:20.499> test<00:06:20.830> which<00:06:21.039> is

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
parasitic draw alternator test which is

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.999 
parasitic draw alternator test which is
of<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.610> would<00:06:21.999> say<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.180> pretty<00:06:22.479> rare<00:06:23.009> occurrence

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
of I would say a pretty rare occurrence

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.640 
of I would say a pretty rare occurrence
to<00:06:24.189> see<00:06:24.339> an<00:06:24.460> alternator<00:06:25.029> be<00:06:25.960> the<00:06:26.169> cause<00:06:26.379> of<00:06:26.409> a

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
to see an alternator be the cause of a

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.410 
to see an alternator be the cause of a
parasitic<00:06:27.069> drain

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
parasitic drain
