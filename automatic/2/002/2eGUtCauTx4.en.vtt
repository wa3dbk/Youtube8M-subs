00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
sounds tedious but it truly is the best

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
sounds tedious but it truly is the best
way<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.400> actually<00:03:21.060> figure<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.630> what's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
way to actually figure out what's

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.290 
way to actually figure out what's
causing<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.130> were<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.760> remove<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.090> bunch

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300

causing it if you were to remove a bunch
of<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.010> reboot<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.130> PC<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.910> fix<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
of them and reboot your PC and fix the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.600 
of them and reboot your PC and fix the
problem<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.770> will<00:03:29.040> have<00:03:29.100> never<00:03:29.370> known

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
problem you will have never known

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.150 
problem you will have never known
exactly<00:03:30.239> what<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.510> was<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:31.410> go<00:03:31.530> one<00:03:31.739> at<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.920> time

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
exactly what it was to go one at a time

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.670 
exactly what it was to go one at a time
so<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.239> backtrack<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.780> also<00:03:34.020> recommend

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
so you can backtrack I also recommend

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.110 
so you can backtrack I also recommend
keeping<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.790> pad<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.150> pen<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:38.489> keep<00:03:38.880> track

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
keeping a pad and pen to just keep track

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.729 
keeping a pad and pen to just keep track
of<00:03:39.330> what<00:03:39.450> you're<00:03:39.540> removing<00:03:39.900> or<00:03:40.290> what<00:03:40.590> you're

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
of what you're removing or what you're

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.150 
of what you're removing or what you're
adding<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.630> when<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.620> figure<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.980> out

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
adding so that when you do figure it out

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.430 
adding so that when you do figure it out
you'll<00:03:44.970> know<00:03:45.150> what<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.450> was<00:03:45.630> exactly<00:03:45.810> rather

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
you'll know what it was exactly rather

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.949 
you'll know what it was exactly rather
than<00:03:46.790> just<00:03:47.790> randomly<00:03:48.180> fixing<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.720> never

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
than just randomly fixing it never

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.310 
than just randomly fixing it never
knowing<00:03:49.290> why<00:03:49.700> if<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.270> performance<00:03:51.840> reason

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
knowing why if it's a performance reason

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.870
