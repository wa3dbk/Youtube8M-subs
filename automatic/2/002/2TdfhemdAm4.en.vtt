00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.520
 this time the system adds them 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.960
 we bring the revision of and I hope 15r 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.419
 3000 series 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.339
 although it is the team that we have here is 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:29.570
 a team of 15.6 inches quite 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:31.759
 Nine started long if they are 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.059
 We remember that the equipment of moto2 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.329
 characterized by events but very 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.370
 very effective supporters 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.089
 physically it has on the outside it has 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.850
 three usb 3.0 ports one entry 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.879
 hearing aids and microphone entry for key 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.579
 of the hdmi ethernet cable and the squirrels' 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.379
 of air usual in the front account 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.449
 with the card entry the cd and a 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.149
 pair of speakers of very good quality 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.220
 enters very good sound quality the 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.479
 which is for our taste are very 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.300
 well located in the front 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.880
 to create those are that feeling of 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.940
 surround sound to the user 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 at the other end they have only one port 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.170
 usb 2.0 in this case and the unit 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.360
 in the back there is nothing something 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.390
 that we have to highlight a lot of this 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.259
 equipment is its sturdy hinge like 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.150
 can see really makes an effort 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.710
 to be able to open it 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.480
 and this is more appreciated because it is 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.480
 of a computer with a touch screen 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:50.220
 in its resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.390
 counts as a fourth i5 processor 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.290
 1.6 generation with ram memory of 8 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.550
 gigas at 1600 megahertz the graph is a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.820
 intel hd 4,400 your hard drive from unter 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.700
 a is signed by digital western and is 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.890
 only 5400 revolutions us 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.710
 would have liked that well mounted when 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.080
 we about 7,200 that really always gives 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.500
 greater performance in the section of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 numbers 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.830
 to accept certain gestures with both 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.830
 fingers but they really are very 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.810
 very little as you can see it already works if 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.460
 they do not have that softness that we could see 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.710
 on any other team one more per 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.600
 example that are already prepared for 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.640
 this kind of gestures 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.950
 we can not use peer here but if 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.500
 we have to affirm 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.420
 very good fingers to achieve the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.810
 strong effect comes from agency 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.430
 with windows 8 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.879
 64-bit or trips to take advantage 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.629
 the 8 gigs boot is not delivered 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.629
 then the team 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:26.760
 the screen with windows 8 to work 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.739
 with type files really 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.920
 trustworthy remember that they always see 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.440
 we stick with the equipment 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.410
 tracy mentioned the team did not 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.470
 but still very hot quarters 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.080
 it warms up and we do not have in this case 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.000
 connected to the electric current 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.970
 we have not tested it with the cable 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.270
 we want to tell you that this is how 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.240
 heat a little more and I repeat it's a lot 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.820
 much much to be thankful for that 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.090
 hinges are very resistant not like the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.240
 that we analyze in the env HP and we leave you 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.760
 the previous video that the hinge was very 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.060
 very flimsy and his screen was here 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.550
 and they had and here this team has 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.160
 treated that is plastic person the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.190
 construction I go and I do not know how to listen to the 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.000
 typical suits the crunching of plastic 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.210
 it really is a very solid team it is not 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.300
 an ultrabook definitely but if it's 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.800
 a modern equipment and that can work 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.500
 for any kind of need that 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.710
 we have in the market has a value 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.080
 around 12 and 15 thousand pesos of this 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.240
 same place teachers in this case by 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.110
 work is a simple in the expresses 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.110
 in a department store 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.370
 is a 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.310
 a team that really recommends 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.530
 systems 1 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.340
 well friends, we hope that it will be of 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.200
 utility 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.250
 this review that we just did in 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.250
