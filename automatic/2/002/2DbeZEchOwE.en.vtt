protector<00:01:17.370> like<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.940> defender<00:01:18.390> series<00:01:18.510> case

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
protector like the defender series case

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.800 
protector like the defender series case
I'll<00:01:19.410> get<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.650> later<00:01:20.660> so<00:01:21.660> I'll<00:01:21.780> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I'll get to that later so I'll just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.430 
I'll get to that later so I'll just
measure<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> guys<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> we'll

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
measure this out for you guys so we'll

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.930 
measure this out for you guys so we'll
start<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.119> width<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.940> 3.0

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
start with the width which is about 3.0

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.640 
start with the width which is about 3.0
5<00:01:30.210> inches<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> thickness<00:01:34.369> which<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.550> about

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
5 inches the thickness which is about

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
5 inches the thickness which is about
point<00:01:37.650> 6<00:01:38.720> inches<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.619> length<00:01:42.080> which<00:01:43.080> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
point 6 inches and the length which is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.240 
point 6 inches and the length which is
about<00:01:46.399> five<00:01:47.399> point<00:01:47.910> seven<00:01:48.300> inches<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
about five point seven inches so just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
about five point seven inches so just
keep<00:01:50.399> those<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> mind<00:01:53.840> all<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
keep those in mind all right so it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
keep those in mind all right so it
doesn't<00:01:56.009> add<00:01:56.130> too<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.580> thickness<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
doesn't add too much thickness to the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.430 
doesn't add too much thickness to the
phone<00:01:59.330> actually<00:02:00.330> feels<00:02:00.690> quite<00:02:00.899> nice<00:02:01.170> because

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
phone actually feels quite nice because

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.340 
phone actually feels quite nice because
it's<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.100> rounded<00:02:02.580> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.390> edges<00:02:05.270> alright

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
it's it's rounded on the edges alright

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.090 
it's it's rounded on the edges alright
so<00:02:07.350> I'll<00:02:07.440> just<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:09.920> just<00:02:10.920> take<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so I'll just take this off just take the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:20.870 
so I'll just take this off just take the
hard<00:02:11.670> plastic<00:02:11.940> shell<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:17.610> right

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.970 

and<00:02:21.570> we'll<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.440> defender<00:02:22.860> series

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and we'll get to the defender series

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.470 
and we'll get to the defender series
case<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.290> pretty<00:02:26.280> much<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.610> only<00:02:26.820> major

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
case so the pretty much the only major

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.410 
case so the pretty much the only major
difference<00:02:27.690> between<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:29.030> commuter<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
difference between the commuter and the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.570 
difference between the commuter and the
defender<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> has<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> built-in

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
defender is that it has a built-in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.970 
defender is that it has a built-in
screen<00:02:32.850> protector<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.410> hard<00:02:34.740> plastic

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
which is on the outside is now on the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.090 
which is on the outside is now on the
inside<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.360> rubber<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.410> was<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.710> the

inside<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.970> commuter<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
inside of the commuter is now on the

inside<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.230> commuter<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.460> course<00:02:53.600> we

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
inside for the commuter and of course we

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.520 
inside for the commuter and of course we
have<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.780> belt<00:02:55.110> clip<00:02:55.380> for<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.770> defender<00:02:57.530> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
have the belt clip for the defender so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.400 
have the belt clip for the defender so
we'll<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.860> take<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.160> off<00:02:59.400> now<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
we'll just take this off now it's a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.210 
we'll just take this off now it's a
two-piece<00:03:01.830> inner<00:03:02.610> hardshell<00:03:03.980> also<00:03:04.980> has<00:03:05.100> a

two-piece inner hardshell also has a
built-in<00:03:05.250> screen<00:03:05.910> protector<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.680> you'd

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
built-in screen protector so if you'd

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.920 
built-in screen protector so if you'd

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like the built-in screen protector

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.660 
like the built-in screen protector
instead<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> separate<00:03:10.980> screen<00:03:11.250> protector

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
instead of the separate screen protector

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180 
instead of the separate screen protector
from<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> Commuter<00:03:13.380> Series<00:03:13.560> case<00:03:13.710> you<00:03:14.100> might

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
from the Commuter Series case you might

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.950 
from the Commuter Series case you might
want<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.460> go<00:03:14.580> with<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:15.000> defender<00:03:15.660> series<00:03:15.780> case

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
want to go with a defender series case

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.980 
want to go with a defender series case
or<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:16.920> belt<00:03:17.490> holsters<00:03:18.090> might<00:03:18.780> want

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
or if you like belt holsters might want

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.310 
or if you like belt holsters might want
to<00:03:19.050> go<00:03:19.140> for<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.500> defender<00:03:19.890> series<00:03:20.010> case<00:03:21.320> so

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
to go for the defender series case so

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.390 
to go for the defender series case so
I'll<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:22.650> slide<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.100> in

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.229 

alright<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.579> then<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:35.489> put<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.700> outer

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
alright and then just put on the outer

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.280 
alright and then just put on the outer
rubber<00:03:41.610> all<00:03:42.610> right<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:43.870> have<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.140> usual

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
rubber all right we have the usual

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.289 
rubber all right we have the usual

top volume rockers are covered power

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.670 
top volume rockers are covered power
button<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.489> covered<00:03:51.909> so<00:03:52.659> almost<00:03:52.959> identical<00:03:53.470> to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
button is covered so almost identical to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.539 
button is covered so almost identical to
the<00:03:54.000> commuter<00:03:55.000> case<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.980> have<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.129> say<00:03:57.280> this

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
the commuter case I have to say this

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.630 
the commuter case I have to say this
does<00:03:58.030> feel<00:03:58.299> a<00:03:58.359> bit<00:03:58.680> bulkier<00:03:59.680> compared<00:04:00.159> to<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
does feel a bit bulkier compared to the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.030 
does feel a bit bulkier compared to the
Commuter<00:04:00.970> Series<00:04:01.239> case<00:04:01.420> as<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:02.709> see<00:04:02.889> it's

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
Commuter Series case as you can see it's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.690 
Commuter Series case as you can see it's
not<00:04:03.220> really<00:04:03.609> rounded<00:04:04.060> off<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:05.109> kind<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.349> a

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
not really rounded off it's kind of a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.339 
not really rounded off it's kind of a
hard<00:04:06.700> edge<00:04:07.000> surface<00:04:07.540> compared<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.139> the

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
hard edge surface compared to the

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.759 
hard edge surface compared to the
commuter<00:04:08.650> which<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:09.549> rounded<00:04:10.030> on<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:11.500> edges

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
commuter which is rounded on the edges

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.740 
commuter which is rounded on the edges
so<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:11.950> feels<00:04:12.220> feel<00:04:12.849> slimmer<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.420> hands

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
so it feels feel slimmer in the hands

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.080 
so it feels feel slimmer in the hands
compared<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.980> defender<00:04:15.430> series<00:04:15.549> case<00:04:16.410> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
compared to the defender series case and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.759 
compared to the defender series case and
this<00:04:19.090> case<00:04:19.150> also<00:04:19.479> still<00:04:19.900> has<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.079> raised<00:04:20.440> edge

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
this case also still has a raised edge

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.980 
this case also still has a raised edge
so<00:04:21.609> if<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.729> having<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.000> drop<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.389> I'll<00:04:22.810> give

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
so if you having to drop it I'll give

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.409 
so if you having to drop it I'll give
some<00:04:23.139> extra<00:04:23.380> protection<00:04:23.849> but<00:04:24.849> it's<00:04:24.970> not<00:04:25.150> that

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
some extra protection but it's not that

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.450 
some extra protection but it's not that
much<00:04:25.449> thicker<00:04:25.930> than<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.260> commuter<00:04:26.889> case<00:04:27.099> it

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
much thicker than the commuter case it

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.939 
much thicker than the commuter case it
just<00:04:27.760> feels<00:04:28.000> thicker<00:04:28.240> due<00:04:28.509> to<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.960> non

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
just feels thicker due to the non

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.610 
just feels thicker due to the non
rounded<00:04:30.520> edge<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.990> I'll<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:32.139> measure<00:04:32.410> this

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
rounded edge so I'll just measure this

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:42.890 
rounded edge so I'll just measure this
out<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:36.400> about<00:04:37.229> three<00:04:38.229> inches

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.969 

thickness<00:04:43.900> is<00:04:44.050> about<00:04:44.289> point<00:04:44.740> six<00:04:45.039> seven<00:04:45.460> and

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
thickness is about point six seven and

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:58.200 
thickness is about point six seven and
length<00:04:48.599> is<00:04:49.599> about<00:04:52.740> 5.8<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:56.050> maybe<00:04:56.669> about<00:04:57.669> point

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
length is about 5.8 so maybe about point

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.370 
length is about 5.8 so maybe about point
one<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.930> an<00:04:59.020> inch<00:05:00.330> bigger<00:05:01.330> in<00:05:01.599> all<00:05:01.780> aspects

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
one of an inch bigger in all aspects

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.200 
one of an inch bigger in all aspects
compared<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:02.979> commuter<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.520> not<00:05:03.789> that

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
compared to the commuter so not that

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.210 
compared to the commuter so not that
much<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.479> a<00:05:04.659> difference<00:05:07.650> pretty<00:05:08.650> much<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
much of a difference pretty much the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.790 
much of a difference pretty much the
deciding<00:05:09.729> factors<00:05:10.120> are<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.720> built-in<00:05:11.620> screen

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
deciding factors are the built-in screen

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.040 
deciding factors are the built-in screen
protector<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.430> holster<00:05:13.330> because<00:05:13.900> he

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
protector and the holster because he

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.980 
protector and the holster because he
because<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.010> believe<00:05:15.310> both<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.270> cases<00:05:16.419> offer

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
because I believe both the cases offer

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.760 
because I believe both the cases offer
the<00:05:17.560> same<00:05:17.830> amount<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.130> protection<00:05:19.680> when<00:05:20.680> you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
the same amount of protection when you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.750 
the same amount of protection when you
put<00:05:20.919> on<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.130> screen<00:05:21.370> protector<00:05:21.669> of<00:05:21.699> course<00:05:22.680> so

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
put on the screen protector of course so

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.149 
put on the screen protector of course so
it<00:05:24.760> all<00:05:24.880> depends<00:05:25.360> on<00:05:25.599> personal<00:05:25.990> preference<00:05:26.229> if
