so<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so and we're going to do that on the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.179 
so and we're going to do that on the
other<00:01:16.409> end<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> well

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
other end as well

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
other end as well
now<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.759> might<00:01:17.970> want<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
now one thing you might want to do is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
now one thing you might want to do is
take<00:01:19.380> note<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.830> polarity<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
take note of the polarity on the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
take note of the polarity on the
batteries<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:22.320> particular<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
batteries this particular one the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.609 
batteries this particular one the
positive<00:01:23.549> end<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.240> top<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
positive end is the top and the the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
positive end is the top and the the
negative<00:01:26.070> end<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> bottom<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.299> not

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
negative end is the bottom that's not

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
negative end is the bottom that's not
the<00:01:27.810> same<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.350> shavers<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.009> again<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the same with all shavers so again you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.950 
the same with all shavers so again you
before<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> actually<00:01:30.210> remove<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
before you actually remove them you

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
before you actually remove them you
might<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> take<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> look<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
might want to take a look at the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
might want to take a look at the
polarity<00:01:32.520> we're<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> same

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
polarity we're going to also do the same

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
polarity we're going to also do the same
thing<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> end<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> battery<00:01:35.310> we're

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
thing on this end of the battery we're

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.090 
thing on this end of the battery we're
going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> pry<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.200> metal<00:01:37.680> tab<00:01:38.240> and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
going to pry off that that metal tab and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to pry off that that metal tab and
remove<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> battery<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.030> we've<00:01:42.180> got

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
remove the battery now what we've got

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.260

them<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.259> Newton

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
them out a little bit with the Newton

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
them out a little bit with the Newton
nose<00:01:49.950> pliers<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
nose pliers and then what we're going to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
nose pliers and then what we're going to
do<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> we're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.200> our<00:01:55.380> battery

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
do is we're going to take our battery

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
do is we're going to take our battery
that<00:01:56.070> has<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.399> tabs<00:01:56.640> already<00:01:57.030> attached<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that has the tabs already attached to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
that has the tabs already attached to
the<00:01:57.600> end<00:01:57.780> we're<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> sort<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> fold

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the end we're just going to sort of fold

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.969 
the end we're just going to sort of fold
them<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.050 

now<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
now what you're going to want to do is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.850 
now what you're going to want to do is
take<00:02:09.630> your<00:02:09.750> soldering<00:02:10.170> iron<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.709> some

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
take your soldering iron and some

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.949 
take your soldering iron and some
electrical<00:02:11.039> solder<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.880> you're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
electrical solder and you're going to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.420 
electrical solder and you're going to
want<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.319> sort<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> little<00:02:16.770> solder<00:02:17.160> on

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
want to sort of put a little solder on

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.130 
want to sort of put a little solder on
the<00:02:17.670> tab<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.020> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the tab here and here and then just a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.790 
the tab here and here and then just a
dab<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.380> solder<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:23.040> each<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.790> these<00:02:23.880> tabs<00:02:24.270> here

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
dab of solder on each of these tabs here

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.140 
dab of solder on each of these tabs here
making<00:02:25.800> sure<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.100> you've<00:02:26.250> got<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.610> polarity

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
making sure that you've got the polarity

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.970 
making sure that you've got the polarity
correct<00:02:27.709> you'll<00:02:28.709> then<00:02:28.950> insert<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.730> battery

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
correct you'll then insert the battery

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.440 
correct you'll then insert the battery
so<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.280> making<00:02:32.610> contact<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:33.300> those

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
so that it's making contact with those

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680 
so that it's making contact with those
tabs<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:35.790> you'll<00:02:35.970> take<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.269> soldering

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
tabs and then you'll take your soldering

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.270 
tabs and then you'll take your soldering
iron<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.640> solder<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.750> tab<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:41.100> we

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
iron and just solder the tab that we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.979 
iron and just solder the tab that we
left<00:02:41.519> attached<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.269> circuit<00:02:42.600> board<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
left attached to the circuit board to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.100 
left attached to the circuit board to
the<00:02:43.910> existing<00:02:44.910> tab<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> battery<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the existing tab on the battery and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.890 
the existing tab on the battery and
we'll<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.920> both<00:02:47.069> sides<00:02:47.720> give<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
we'll do that on both sides give it a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.559 
we'll do that on both sides give it a
second<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> harden<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.730> then<00:02:51.269> you'll<00:02:51.420> have

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
second to harden up and then you'll have

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.150 
second to harden up and then you'll have
a<00:02:51.630> good<00:02:51.900> connection<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.650> your<00:02:52.799> new<00:02:52.980> battery

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
a good connection with your new battery

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.259 
a good connection with your new battery
in<00:02:53.610> place<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:55.280> you'll<00:02:56.280> be<00:02:56.459> ready<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.819> recharge

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
in place and you'll be ready to recharge

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.080 
in place and you'll be ready to recharge
the<00:02:57.510> new<00:02:57.630> battery
