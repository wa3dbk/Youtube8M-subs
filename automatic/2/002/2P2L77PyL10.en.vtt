 hello to you gamers and welcome to 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.700
 world of gaming so we end up 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.480
 for a video presentation of 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.040
 the i and access app dropped then 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.620
 this application already she is 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.440
 only available on xbox one 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.680
 it's actually an application that 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.220
 works by subscription so for $ 5 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.350
 or 5 euros a month or so 30 $ 25 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.380
 euros a year you will be able 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 download and play as much as you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 want to a selection of games 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 electronic art to also have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.580
 a reduction of -10% on all 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 downloadable games and content 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.380
 electronic art and you will have the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.900
 possibility also to test games 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.949
 five days before their release 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.839
 so like some kind of demo or beta 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.910
 these tests will be of limited duration by 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.160
 example will download the game in 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 preview 5 for the before he played 30 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.810
 minutes or an hour maybe and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 then the access will unlock the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 unlockable I think the day of the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.800
 out of the game we pay by paying this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 last so I'm going to launch 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.409
 the app to show you what 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 looks exactly like this app 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.770
 so already for xbox owners 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 phone will not try to download it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.070
 application will be released in europe and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.790
 North America 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.800
 summer current 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.780
 so I got it I got the plication 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.850
 because it's part of the beta program 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.380
 microsoft testers they sent me a 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 key to download this application 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.820
 is tested this subscription so when 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.530
 you are launching for the first time this 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.550
 application 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.280
 Normally you get on a screen 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.520
 who asks you to either pay at least 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.640
 per month so 5 euros or so to pay 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.990
 to the year 25 euros so 25 euros to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.760
 the year you do the math is good 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.230
 more profitable it makes you pretty much 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.550
 two euros a month 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.960
 and so then you come on a 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.899
 home screen so on the screen 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.239
 chest there are four games then 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.220

 soon there will be more titles 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.450
 I hope it will be more titles 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.890
 Recent 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.900
 because the games we have in a few 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.450
 months already 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.849
 play for less so the reduction 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.819
 of 10% that I spoke to you especially the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.680
 digital shopping electronic art is 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.980
 also the player before premieres 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.459
 which I find is not bad so you have 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.760
 early access to the five-day game 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.040
 before their official release date which 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.900
 allows to get an idea of ​​the title 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.180
 before he goes out and find out if yes or 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.700
 no we buy what what is 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.730
 good is all the more so as the demos get 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.590
 are quite rare I find 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.820
 so that can be pretty cool 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.410
 to have this early access five days 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.810
 so here I hope I hope that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.490
 this video showed you a little what 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.740
