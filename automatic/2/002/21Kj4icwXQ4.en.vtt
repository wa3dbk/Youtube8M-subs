anyway<00:00:01.050> it's<00:00:01.439> opened<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> book<00:00:02.570> that<00:00:03.570> looks

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
anyway it's opened a book that looks

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:18.040 
anyway it's opened a book that looks
really<00:00:03.929> good<00:00:07.340> lift<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> item<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.790> correct

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.010 

treat<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.080> well<00:00:20.240> Khloe<00:00:21.240> feels<00:00:21.480> nicer<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
treat it well Khloe feels nicer this

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.400 
treat it well Khloe feels nicer this
which<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:22.920> good<00:00:25.460> that's<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> problem

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
which is very good that's the problem

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.359 
which is very good that's the problem
let's<00:00:28.410> sold<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> connection<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.720> broken

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
let's sold a connection there is broken

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.799 
let's sold a connection there is broken
but<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.059> actually<00:00:33.270> end<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.660> been

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but there that's actually end it's been

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
but there that's actually end it's been
pulled<00:00:34.050> through<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:37.219> quite<00:00:38.219> badly<00:00:40.879> we<00:00:41.879> sold

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pulled through and quite badly we sold

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.279 
pulled through and quite badly we sold
it<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:45.020> don't<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.840> repair<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it so I don't know if we can repair that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.459 
it so I don't know if we can repair that
will<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> way<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.520> transactions<00:00:54.180> gone

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
will see the way these transactions gone

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
will see the way these transactions gone
not<00:00:55.469> holding<00:00:55.770> too<00:00:55.920> many<00:00:56.100> hopes<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> will

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not holding too many hopes so it will

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.450 
not holding too many hopes so it will
kind<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> nerdy<00:00:59.340> chick<00:00:59.579> Oh<00:01:03.470> 15<00:01:04.470> ohms<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
kind of nerdy chick Oh 15 ohms is the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
kind of nerdy chick Oh 15 ohms is the
impedance<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.659> should<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.869> looking<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.200> DC

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
impedance so we should be looking to DC

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
impedance so we should be looking to DC
I<00:01:09.170> guess<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> between<00:01:10.470> 12<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> 14<00:01:11.850> let's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
I guess from in between 12 and 14 let's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.520 
I guess from in between 12 and 14 let's
look<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> solar<00:01:13.140> tabs<00:01:13.970> open<00:01:14.970> circuit<00:01:15.530> open

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
look at the solar tabs open circuit open

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.840 
look at the solar tabs open circuit open
circuit<00:01:18.229> let's<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:20.009> further<00:01:20.070> seven<00:01:20.610> get

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
circuit let's go a bit further seven get

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.469 
circuit let's go a bit further seven get
any<00:01:21.000> impedance<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.650> wires<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> solar

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
any impedance on the wires so the solar

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.560 
any impedance on the wires so the solar
tabs<00:01:24.920> read<00:01:25.920> zero<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.909> open<00:01:27.210> circuit

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
tabs read zero to this open circuit

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
tabs read zero to this open circuit
sorry<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.900> read<00:01:28.110> open<00:01:28.500> surfing<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.920> sewer

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
sorry they read open surfing on sewer

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.010 
sorry they read open surfing on sewer
but<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> hear<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.640> braid

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
but then we go to hear out of the braid

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.460 
but then we go to hear out of the braid
we<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:35.150> 12.4<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.110> good<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
we get 12.4 which is very good which is

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.850 
we get 12.4 which is very good which is
correct<00:01:38.119> however<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.869> speaker<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> faulty

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
correct however this speaker is faulty

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.190 
correct however this speaker is faulty
luckily<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> repair<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
luckily I think I know how to repair it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.340 
luckily I think I know how to repair it
no<00:01:46.200> telltale<00:01:46.680> sign<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.630> don't<00:01:48.630> forget<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
no telltale sign I don't forget see this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
no telltale sign I don't forget see this
let's<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.640> are

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
let's have a look here are there we are

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
let's have a look here are there we are
yep<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.869> wire<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:53.490> wiring<00:01:53.820> inside

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
yep is this wire here this wiring inside

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.130 
yep is this wire here this wiring inside
is<00:01:55.159> very<00:01:56.159> straight<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.450> should<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:57.840> have

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
is very straight it should actually have

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
is very straight it should actually have
a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.350> bit<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> curve<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.780> as

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a little bit of a curve to it because as

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.800 
a little bit of a curve to it because as
this<00:02:01.020> cone<00:02:01.320> vibrates<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:03.479> wire

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
this cone vibrates in and out that wire

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.109 
this cone vibrates in and out that wire
has<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:05.189> extra<00:02:05.310> length<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
has to have some extra length to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.180 
has to have some extra length to
compensate<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.079> vibration<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.069> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
compensate for the vibration this is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.930 
compensate for the vibration this is
clearly<00:02:08.670> broken<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.700> look<00:02:11.849> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
clearly broken right here and look is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
clearly broken right here and look is
actually<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.300> broken<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
actually is broken and it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.039 
actually is broken and it
sitting<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.330> that's<00:02:15.510> interesting

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
sitting in there so that's interesting

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.770 
sitting in there so that's interesting
and<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.170> stupid<00:02:19.500> thing<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.709> if<00:02:20.299> if<00:02:21.299> when<00:02:21.599> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and the stupid thing is if if when you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.470 
and the stupid thing is if if when you
try<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.440> fix<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.799> problem<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:24.120> make<00:02:24.330> that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
try and fix this problem you make that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.080 
try and fix this problem you make that
wire<00:02:24.810> very<00:02:25.799> tight<00:02:26.159> just<00:02:26.640> by<00:02:26.760> pulling<00:02:26.940> it

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
wire very tight just by pulling it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.720 
wire very tight just by pulling it
through<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.330> riesling<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.099> fact<00:02:29.310> create

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
through a riesling it you in fact create

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.050 
through a riesling it you in fact create
a<00:02:29.760> secondary<00:02:30.209> stress<00:02:30.569> point<00:02:31.640> where<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> wire

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
a secondary stress point where the wire

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.309 
a secondary stress point where the wire
joins<00:02:33.900> onto<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.319> cone<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.959> then<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.110> fails

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
joins onto the cone and then it fails

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.210 
joins onto the cone and then it fails
there<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.739> then<00:02:37.830> you're<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.040> real<00:02:38.190> trouble

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
there and then you're in real trouble

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.650 
there and then you're in real trouble
and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> start<00:02:39.269> hacking<00:02:39.450> into

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
and then you have to start hacking into

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.500 
and then you have to start hacking into
the<00:02:39.780> cone<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.140> repair<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
the cone to repair it here we have the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
the cone to repair it here we have the
wire<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.299> completely<00:02:45.750> detached<00:02:46.170> from

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.930 

the<00:02:50.190> sole<00:02:50.400> during<00:02:50.640> tab<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:53.760> just

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the sole during tab and it's it's just

attempted to resolder it and maybe been

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.849

successful<00:03:06.900> at<00:03:06.989> one<00:03:07.109> point<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.769> then

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
successful at one point there and then

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.229 
successful at one point there and then
just<00:03:08.040> broken<00:03:08.430> again<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:08.970> there's<00:03:09.150> not

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
just broken again because there's not

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.220 
just broken again because there's not
enough<00:03:09.450> wire<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.780> that's<00:03:13.079> all<00:03:13.200> very

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
enough wire so that's all very

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.910 
enough wire so that's all very
interesting<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:14.930> guess<00:03:15.930> we'll<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.680> wait

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
interesting I guess we'll have to wait

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.580 
interesting I guess we'll have to wait
and<00:03:16.980> see<00:03:17.160> whether<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:17.609> not<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:19.169> speaker

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and see whether or not the speaker

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.609 
and see whether or not the speaker
itself<00:03:19.709> works<00:03:22.220> there's<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.370> bone
