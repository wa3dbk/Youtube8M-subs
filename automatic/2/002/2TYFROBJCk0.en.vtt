still an engaged one about it being
relevant<00:01:23.270> today<00:01:23.509> now<00:01:24.080> it's<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.250> impact<00:01:25.670> is

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
relevant today now it's the impact is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.630

that's<00:01:29.030> really<00:01:29.360> hard<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.660> describe<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:30.470> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
that's really hard to describe it as it

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.580 
that's really hard to describe it as it
is<00:01:31.369> always<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.759> moment<00:01:32.149> when<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.869> person<00:01:33.560> walks

through the door and you hold your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.230 
through the door and you hold your
breath<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:36.770> you're<00:01:36.800> never<00:01:37.130> exactly<00:01:37.759> sure

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
breath because you're never exactly sure

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.240 
breath because you're never exactly sure
how<00:01:39.200> much<00:01:39.380> or<00:01:39.530> how<00:01:39.560> little<00:01:39.649> they're<00:01:40.070> going<00:01:40.190> to

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
how much or how little they're going to

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.639 
how much or how little they're going to
look<00:01:40.399> like<00:01:40.430> they're<00:01:40.940> there<00:01:41.210> for<00:01:41.240> bear<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
look like they're there for bear and the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.719 
look like they're there for bear and the
moment<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.039> walk<00:01:43.190> through<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.430> door<00:01:43.550> I

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
moment you walk through the door I

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.900 
moment you walk through the door I
thought<00:01:43.940> oh<00:01:44.680> yes<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:46.160> saw<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.610> straight

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
thought oh yes I just saw it straight

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.480 
thought oh yes I just saw it straight
away<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:47.390> think<00:01:47.600> individuals<00:01:48.560> can<00:01:48.830> change<00:01:49.160> have

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
away I think individuals can change have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.580 
away I think individuals can change have
historically<00:01:50.390> angle<00:01:50.750> always<00:01:51.020> changed<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
historically angle always changed the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.380 
historically angle always changed the
world<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.009> live<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.190> what's<00:01:53.000> interesting

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
world that we live in what's interesting

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.040 
world that we live in what's interesting
is<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> mix<00:01:54.259> between<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:55.280> individual<00:01:56.050> spark

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
is the mix between that individual spark

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.770 
is the mix between that individual spark
and<00:01:57.349> a<00:01:57.950> whole<00:01:58.250> group<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:59.000> people<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.539> then

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
and a whole group of people that then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.809 
and a whole group of people that then
believe<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.619> put<00:02:01.099> all<00:02:01.280> their<00:02:01.610> labor

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
believe in it and put all their labor

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.999 
believe in it and put all their labor
behind<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.479> change<00:02:02.720> without<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.440> two<00:02:03.679> I

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
behind the change without the two I

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.609 
behind the change without the two I
think<00:02:04.789> change<00:02:05.060> doesn't<00:02:05.300> happen<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:05.899> that's

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
think change doesn't happen but that's

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.400 
think change doesn't happen but that's
an<00:02:06.770> interesting<00:02:07.340> example<00:02:07.459> of<00:02:07.849> a<00:02:08.630> lot<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
an interesting example of a lot of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.110 
an interesting example of a lot of
people<00:02:09.740> trying<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.160> change<00:02:10.490> things<00:02:10.789> nothing

much happening and then suddenly you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.089 
much happening and then suddenly you
have<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.280> dynamism<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.420> family<00:02:14.840> that

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099

millions of other people they may ensure

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.040 
millions of other people they may ensure
that<00:02:22.640> there's<00:02:22.880> change<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.420> we<00:02:23.540> all<00:02:23.660> benefit

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.520 
that there's change that we all benefit
from

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
from

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
from
did<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.650> always<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.280> yourself<00:02:26.610> more<00:02:26.790> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
did you always think of yourself more of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.430 
did you always think of yourself more of
Sylvia<00:02:27.690> before<00:02:28.050> yeah<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.380> never<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.690> mean<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
Sylvia before yeah I never I mean it the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.260 
Sylvia before yeah I never I mean it the
face<00:02:31.770> looked<00:02:32.160> familiar<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.940> think<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
face looked familiar and I think it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.550 
face looked familiar and I think it
probably<00:02:33.300> looked<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> me<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.380> some

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
probably looked to me because in some

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.990 
probably looked to me because in some
kind<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.520> subconscious<00:02:35.849> way<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.310> part<00:02:38.849> of

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
kind of subconscious way this is part of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.580 
kind of subconscious way this is part of
me<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:39.569> everybody's<00:02:40.110> always<00:02:40.230> ahead<00:02:40.470> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
me but if everybody's always ahead of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
me but if everybody's always ahead of
time<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.220> think<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.970> pangas<00:02:42.330> name<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.930> is
