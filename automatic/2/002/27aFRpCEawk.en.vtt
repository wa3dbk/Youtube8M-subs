00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 for you that are the most 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.380
 simple I am moral splash and this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 is point and followed today I want to talk about 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.000
 the simplest times when a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 thinking about it did not happen when we did not 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 we made life so complicated and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.640
 we believed faithfully in love when 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.769
 we do campaign degrees with our 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.439
 weeks those times with smiles 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.250
 sincere and deep hugs with balloons 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.800
 water pools mud bicycles 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 baseball brings them and in the afternoons 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 rainy monopoly or fusions that pretty 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 era in which we did not make decisions 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.750
 in which the deep suns and the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.570
 tears could easily be forgotten 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.329
 today it is harder to forget and we 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.070
 we worry more about being forgotten 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.150
 past many things since the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.220
 times of simple souls 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.080
 nobody said that we could not go back to 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.970
 they can always eat it 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.590
 sandwiches in the park and drink bad 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.050
 decisions with the right people 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.760
 we can continue playing with balloons 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.150
 water and make a board game with 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.490
 our lives play however without rules 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.040
 because nobody said that growing meant 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 stop being children and as yuri says 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.400
 there will always be better times without 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.440
 perks or the other time a super 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.840
 Sorry for not uploading video 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.190
 last two weeks is super bad and the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.650
 truth is that I have no excuse 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.210
 because this is something that I love to do and 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.160
 I love that love takes this to 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 see my videos commenting on them 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.229
 send me tweets then I will promise 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 that I'm going to organize a lot better 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.030
 time to be able to give them a video every 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.740
 week as I promised and as I 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.930
 I said I was going to keep doing it because 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.400
 for me this is very important and I want 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.130
 you know I always take it seriously 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.200
 but well let's leave the words 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.240
 back and let's go to the facts 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.070
 I tell you about wine that will soon be 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.409
 a movie of the subject that I'm going to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.149
 talk today and I recently resumed 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.270
 this kind of reading now I'm going to give a 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.630
 different approach to this video when 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.700
 I was younger when I was younger I 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.920
 I loved reading so I loved to read 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
 comics then I'm going to compare it 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.690
 two of my favorite comics pines 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.239
 and mafaldas as they are two comic strips 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.739
 let's use the dynamics of always but 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.140
 type as in a comparative table 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.530
 so 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.319
 let's start ok going down in mafalda 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.130
 it was written by joaquin washed alias 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.230
 quino 1964 to 1973 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.959
 gonzÃ¡lez a girl is 4 years old lives a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.209
 maturity of a mentality much more 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.860
 advanced for its age and for its time 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.110
 he has a great interest in the topics 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.720
 National and international 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.760
 clear a super fatalistic perspective and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.940
 super dramatic of things though 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.550
 they have the right answers and super 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.950
 comedians worshiping viruses has a 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.200
 turtle called bureaucracy or in the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.700
 soup and your dreams work in the un 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.980
 but in addition to mafalda which is the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.570
 main there are other characters is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.450
 Felipito that I always said that I am 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.790
 Felipito because I have his luck and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.610
 they give me moro like him and he 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.019
 Worries about everything but does nothing and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.940
 never have the motivation to do the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.620
 homework and then worry because he did not 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.450
 the task I am happy and you like to 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.090
 susanita who is the kind of woman who 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.690
 he only dreams of getting married and having a child and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.459
 educate him and be a woman of the home says is 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.319
 as his only aspiration in life 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.629
 they are manolito that is the man 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.819
 group business has a warehouse its 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.859
 dream is that it is manolo also

 they are miguelito miguelito is smaller 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.689
 that everyone then is like super cute 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.849
 but also with a super philosophical 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.859
 he has a very father mentality with very 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.930
 and rare but after a while between the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.180
 liberty freedom is super tiny my 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.000
 mom is a translator is a little girl who 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.189
 has political ideas widely read and that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.530
 they really represent his name and 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.510
 It has a certain complex with being small 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.239
 that does not like to make fun of it 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.730
 and good now we are pilots the virus 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.730
 is more old but it lasted longer than 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.760
 mafalda began in 1950 and ended in the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.500
 2001 when the author Charles m.schulz 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.239
 died something very father of pinus is that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.099
 influenced other comic strips 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.690
 including more skirt that is from which 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.359
 we are also talking about the pilot is 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.520
 basically the name of the band yards 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.320
 which is starring charlie brown 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.169
 but also the one that always won 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.729
 focus was snoopy I met him by the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.099
 cartoons because the television series 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.960
 let me tell you that he won his prizes 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.740
 besides that he also has a musical 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.599
 on broadway 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.340
 that is super father the truth music 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.229
 It is very loaded and in November it will be 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.389
 a movie but there are also other 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.160
 characters that bird is a touch 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.650
 yellow that is snoopy's best friend 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.110
 and I have the vato of him by the way 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.270
 you usually see it with a balloon and it has 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.789
 a musical droplet because it 's a bird 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.949
 that is filming and is super tender 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.560
 that besides woodstock is also light 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.949
 and as a combination between more skirt and 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.349
 susanita also wants to be president and 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:08.000

 adding others are more characters 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.370

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.420
