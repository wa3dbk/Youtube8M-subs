00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.280 
that they like better because it's
personal<00:02:05.210> preference<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.780> depends<00:02:06.170> on

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
personal preference it depends on

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.619 
personal preference it depends on
condition<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.890> your<00:02:07.010> idea<00:02:07.490> how<00:02:08.209> often<00:02:08.509> you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
condition is your idea how often you

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.479 
condition is your idea how often you
lube<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.899> chain<00:02:09.080> how<00:02:09.679> often<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.069> clean<00:02:10.459> it

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
lube the chain how often you clean it

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.619 
lube the chain how often you clean it
there's<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.209> whole<00:02:11.329> bunch<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.540> different

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
there's a whole bunch of different

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.830 
there's a whole bunch of different
factors<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.730> got<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.239> find<00:02:14.389> the<00:02:14.540> one<00:02:14.659> that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
factors so you got to find the one that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.420 
factors so you got to find the one that
works<00:02:15.019> for<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.530> but

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
works for you but

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.179 
works for you but
we<00:02:16.969> like<00:02:17.209> rock<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.689> roll<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.260> tends<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.950> stay

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
we like rock and roll it tends to stay

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.190 
we like rock and roll it tends to stay
on<00:02:19.370> pretty<00:02:19.640> long<00:02:19.849> we<00:02:20.239> use<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.629> blue<00:02:20.900> there's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
on pretty long we use the blue there's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.440 
on pretty long we use the blue there's
three<00:02:21.439> different<00:02:21.560> flavors<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> speak

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
three different flavors so to speak

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.390 
three different flavors so to speak
there's<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> gold<00:02:24.140> there's<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.620> red<00:02:24.859> that's<00:02:25.099> road

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
there's a gold there's a red that's road

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.449 
there's a gold there's a red that's road
but<00:02:26.239> for<00:02:26.569> us<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.840> extreme<00:02:27.290> tends<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.980> last<00:02:28.219> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
but for us the extreme tends to last the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.580 
but for us the extreme tends to last the
longest<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:29.659> that's<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.200> tend<00:02:30.439> to<00:02:30.500> use

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
longest so that's what we tend to use

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.679 
longest so that's what we tend to use
road<00:02:31.040> mountain<00:02:31.579> whatever<00:02:32.120> that's<00:02:32.390> pretty

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
road mountain whatever that's pretty

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.440 
road mountain whatever that's pretty
much<00:02:32.840> our<00:02:33.079> favorite<00:02:33.560> there<00:02:34.069> again<00:02:34.400> try<00:02:35.239> some

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
much our favorite there again try some

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.819 
much our favorite there again try some
different<00:02:35.569> ones<00:02:35.780> see<00:02:36.109> which<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:36.439> works<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
different ones see which one works the

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.970 
different ones see which one works the
best<00:02:37.090> most<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.299> these<00:02:38.709> what<00:02:39.709> I'm<00:02:39.799> going<00:02:39.950> to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
best most of these what I'm going to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160 
best most of these what I'm going to
tell<00:02:40.129> you<00:02:40.250> about<00:02:40.340> lubin<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:40.909> going<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.180> go<00:02:41.450> no

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
tell you about lubin is going to go no

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
tell you about lubin is going to go no
matter<00:02:42.349> which<00:02:42.620> lube<00:02:43.159> you<00:02:43.639> use<00:02:43.939> it's<00:02:44.540> pretty

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
matter which lube you use it's pretty

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.619 
matter which lube you use it's pretty
much<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.049> same<00:02:45.469> procedure<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.480> make

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
much the same procedure you want to make

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.800 
much the same procedure you want to make
sure<00:02:47.659> you<00:02:48.170> wipe<00:02:48.439> all<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.829> excess<00:02:49.639> off<00:02:49.849> if

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
sure you wipe all the excess off if

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.289 
sure you wipe all the excess off if
you're<00:02:51.139> if<00:02:51.500> you've<00:02:51.650> got<00:02:51.919> black<00:02:52.310> gunk<00:02:52.939> all<00:02:53.239> over

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
you're if you've got black gunk all over

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.750 
you're if you've got black gunk all over
your<00:02:54.109> drivetrain<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.889> you're<00:02:55.310> looping<00:02:55.609> your

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
your drivetrain and you're looping your

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.259 
your drivetrain and you're looping your
chain<00:02:56.000> you're<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:57.049> wiping<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.620> down<00:02:57.650> enough

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
chain you're not wiping it down enough

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.759 
chain you're not wiping it down enough
because<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.419> shouldn't<00:02:59.689> have<00:02:59.959> black<00:03:00.290> gunk<00:03:00.590> on

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
because it shouldn't have black gunk on

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.349 
because it shouldn't have black gunk on
it<00:03:00.919> now<00:03:01.069> if<00:03:01.189> your<00:03:01.370> leg<00:03:01.609> hits<00:03:01.879> your<00:03:02.090> chain

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
it now if your leg hits your chain

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.059 
it now if your leg hits your chain
you're<00:03:03.049> probably<00:03:03.260> going<00:03:03.469> to<00:03:03.560> get<00:03:03.650> something

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
you're probably going to get something

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.830 
you're probably going to get something
on<00:03:04.099> your<00:03:04.310> leg<00:03:04.549> because<00:03:05.030> there's<00:03:05.299> something

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
on your leg because there's something

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.500 
on your leg because there's something
there<00:03:06.500> has<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.799> be<00:03:06.829> some<00:03:07.099> lubrication<00:03:07.639> but

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
there has to be some lubrication but

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.110 
there has to be some lubrication but
when<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.260> Lube<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.980> we'll<00:03:10.669> go<00:03:10.819> ahead<00:03:10.909> and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
when you Lube it and we'll go ahead and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.030 
when you Lube it and we'll go ahead and
just<00:03:11.209> show<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.450> how<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.629> do<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.870> I'm<00:03:12.709> going<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
just show you how to do it I'm going to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.709 
just show you how to do it I'm going to
try<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.579> from<00:03:13.909> this<00:03:14.090> side<00:03:14.359> which<00:03:14.569> is

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
try and do this from this side which is

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.619 
try and do this from this side which is
probably<00:03:15.109> going<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.379> be<00:03:15.439> awkward<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:17.480> going

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
probably going to be awkward it's going

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.110 
probably going to be awkward it's going
to<00:03:17.689> be<00:03:17.780> real<00:03:17.959> awkward<00:03:18.129> but<00:03:19.129> so<00:03:19.700> I'm<00:03:19.819> just<00:03:19.939> going

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to be real awkward but so I'm just going

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.780 
to be real awkward but so I'm just going
to<00:03:20.209> take<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:20.810> drip<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.609> every<00:03:22.609> link

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
to take this and drip it on every link

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.289 
to take this and drip it on every link
of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.000> chain<00:03:23.030> now<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:25.519> other<00:03:25.729> way<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.030> can

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
of the chain now the other way you can

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.479 
of the chain now the other way you can
do<00:03:26.479> it<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.720> physically<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.769> go<00:03:27.949> one<00:03:28.220> link

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
do it is physically go and go one link

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.360 
do it is physically go and go one link
at<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.699> time<00:03:28.909> if<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.419> lots<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.870> time<00:03:30.370> and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
at a time if you have lots of time and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.170 
at a time if you have lots of time and
you<00:03:31.609> can<00:03:31.790> do<00:03:31.939> that<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.419> that<00:03:32.599> works<00:03:32.840> great<00:03:33.290> but

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
you can do that and that works great but

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.899 
you can do that and that works great but
for<00:03:35.180> time<00:03:35.510> purposes<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.489> always<00:03:37.489> do<00:03:37.669> it<00:03:37.790> this

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
for time purposes I always do it this

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.080 
for time purposes I always do it this
way<00:03:38.150> now<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.959> can<00:03:39.439> this<00:03:39.949> does<00:03:40.220> pretty<00:03:40.489> thin<00:03:40.790> so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
way now you can this does pretty thin so

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.550 
way now you can this does pretty thin so
it's<00:03:41.239> going<00:03:41.419> to<00:03:41.510> soak<00:03:41.780> all<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.169> way<00:03:42.290> through

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
it's going to soak all the way through

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.099 
it's going to soak all the way through
it<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.859> matter<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.220> seconds<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:43.909> fact<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.959> I

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
it in a matter of seconds in fact if I

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.420 
it in a matter of seconds in fact if I
get<00:03:45.290> enough<00:03:45.500> on<00:03:45.709> there<00:03:45.889> it<00:03:45.979> should<00:03:46.159> start

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
get enough on there it should start

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.580 
get enough on there it should start
dripping<00:03:46.759> on<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.060> chainstay<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.470> want

okay this is a new bike so there really

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.020 
okay this is a new bike so there really
isn't<00:04:38.540> too<00:04:38.870> much<00:04:39.050> on<00:04:39.320> there<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.890> lot<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.730> is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
isn't too much on there a lot of this is

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.800 
isn't too much on there a lot of this is
is<00:04:42.070> basically<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.100> they<00:04:43.700> put<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.180> material

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
is basically that they put this material

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.410 
is basically that they put this material
on<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.230> like<00:04:46.070> lubricant<00:04:46.700> for<00:04:47.120> shipping

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
on this like lubricant for shipping

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.270 
on this like lubricant for shipping
purposes<00:04:47.570> because<00:04:48.380> everything<00:04:49.010> shipped

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
purposes because everything shipped

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.670 
purposes because everything shipped
across<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.760> ocean<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:51.110> got<00:04:51.260> kind<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.590> a

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
across the ocean so it's got kind of a

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.410 
across the ocean so it's got kind of a
thick<00:04:51.920> coating<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.820> if<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.240> ever

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
thick coating on it that if you ever

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.270 
thick coating on it that if you ever
notice<00:04:53.930> your<00:04:54.110> chain<00:04:54.380> if<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.800> put<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.010> chain<00:04:55.220> on

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
notice your chain if you put a chain on

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.310 
notice your chain if you put a chain on
yourself<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:55.910> kind<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.180> gunky<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:57.170> it's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
yourself it's kind of gunky so it's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.430 
yourself it's kind of gunky so it's
taken<00:04:57.680> most<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.160> stuff<00:04:58.340> off<00:04:59.350> so<00:05:00.350> you're

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
taken most of that stuff off so you're

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.990 
taken most of that stuff off so you're
just<00:05:00.500> going<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.800> wipe<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.280> make<00:05:01.670> sure<00:05:01.700> you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
just going to wipe it and make sure you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.870 
just going to wipe it and make sure you
get<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.330> nice<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.140> dry<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.560> side<00:05:03.950> plates<00:05:04.310> and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
get it nice and dry the side plates and

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.280 
get it nice and dry the side plates and
that's<00:05:05.180> going<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.480> leave<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.780> lube<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.110> the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
that's going to leave the lube on the

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.630 
that's going to leave the lube on the
inside<00:05:06.850> where<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:08.000> need<00:05:08.180> it<00:05:08.260> everybody<00:05:09.640> okay

inside where you need it everybody okay
that<00:05:10.910> makes<00:05:11.120> sense<00:05:11.770> okay<00:05:12.770> so<00:05:13.550> basically<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
that makes sense okay so basically the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.140 
that makes sense okay so basically the
chains<00:05:15.140> done<00:05:15.560> but<00:05:16.220> we've<00:05:16.430> dripped<00:05:16.790> it<00:05:17.000> all

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
chains done but we've dripped it all

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.370 
chains done but we've dripped it all
over<00:05:18.010> everything<00:05:19.010> here<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:20.180> best<00:05:20.870> thing<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.230> do

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
over everything here so best thing to do

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.980 
over everything here so best thing to do
so<00:05:21.650> what's<00:05:22.220> ever<00:05:22.460> left<00:05:22.580> on<00:05:22.970> here<00:05:23.210> won't<00:05:23.450> sling

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
so what's ever left on here won't sling

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.440 
so what's ever left on here won't sling
