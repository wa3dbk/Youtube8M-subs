 I have not been a single convention 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.860
 low and single rug and actually conscious 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.050

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.660
 new controller 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.620

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:37.010

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.319
 wow and then the PC in the ferry house is not large 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.650

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.880
 Fat 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.470
 He is really very young to be beautiful 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.430
 hold things 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.780

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.650
 system software fine this booklet 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:33.790
 and then I get something here 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.599
 a package with all cables and the beautiful 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.950
 is up if you have a playstation 3 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.269
 this is the power cable again 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.849
 universal 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.469
 so your playstation 3 can get cold 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.389
 just use that just got 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.799
 you can even use it for a place 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.849
 entry a plug on and then the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.170
 playstation 4 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.599
 you only need one power cable 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 of course then is ideal but it 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.169
 is just more to use 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.540
 then i see here a mini usb and hdmi and 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.730
 and standard an earbud with the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.209
 Microphone that you can control 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.900
 plugs and then you immediately have sound and 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.609
 everything 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 you can communicate right away it is 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.930
 of course and that best quality 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.660

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.620

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.270

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.990
 just not much but it is just 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.190

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.990
