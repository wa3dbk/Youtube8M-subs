 Yala Idea and Daytime Running Lights for Passenger Cars It has always been trailblazing 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.689
 Now the company offers a DRL retrofit kit approved in Europe 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.029
 which is suitable for most European car models 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.029
 the assembly is uncomplicated and takes about one and a half hours 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.170
 For this guide we have chosen a popular sedan the Alfa 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.170
 Romeo 159 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.670
 The WLZ is supplied with assembly instructions and includes 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.340
 2 LPG light modules 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.130
 two Klitschko and mounts 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.719
 An electronic plague plans control unit with pluggable connected 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.719
 and fortification and citizens 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.820
 First, they have to decide where to install the lamps measure 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 on the vehicle so that the position corresponds to the European regulations 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.580
 You will find a diagram with this information either in the assembly instructions 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.850
 or at www alea dem retrofit de 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.590
 once you have chosen the position of the lights 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.170
 Make sure that the angle of the lights is at most ten degrees from the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.439
 Adjusting the shape of a direction mark the holes through the bracket 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.439
 and screw them tight 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
 in some cars like the Audi a3, the lower Dieter must first 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.470
 be removed 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.440
 If necessary, a body part must be loosened to remove the trim 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.080
 mark the position of the bracket and cut it with drill and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.170
 Jigsaw a fitting opening 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.229
 in which the aging can be bent if necessary put the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.330
 Fade back to find and take the best angle for the light 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
 Then you back off to attach the bracket 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.009
 To connect the module, first select a position for the 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.170
 Control unit locate a fixed position near the battery 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.769
 but not too close to a heat source 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.849
 but do not deal with it yet 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.180
 Now take the battery cover off the negative basket should be disconnected 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.479
 before starting with the wiring 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:39.039
 first connect the red wire to the free positive pole and secure it 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.039
 him 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.239
 then firmly connect the black wire to - poles 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.959
 To complete the wiring run the cables from the DRL 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.059
 Modules on both sides through the body upwards 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.369
 For some cars body parts must be solved 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.459
 do not put the DRM modules in the brackets yet this is the last one 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.749
 step 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.440
 in the cable routing through the body 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.260
 please sharp surfaces 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.409
 you would be sources 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.409
 and avoid moving parts 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.559
 To determine the status of the light circuit, remove the plug from the 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:32.529
 Front headlights from the correct Korbel find it with the Philips control unit 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.950
 or a car tester 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.599
 the control unit indicates that important cables with a light blue NPD on 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.940
 If you have found the cable, please turn off the parking light 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.709
 Now connect the pluggable connection to the stand 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.759
 Finally, secure the control unit in the desired position 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.759
 position 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.099
 replace the battery cover and close the two 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.359
 DRL modules on 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.409
 now they can check the lights 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.489
 by starting the engine 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.699
 if they are sure that everything works, they put the DRM modules 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.249
 in the brackets 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.629
 At the end, they swap according to European regulations 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.759
 Standlicht confused against the two lovers as Raubein

 Secure excess cable lengths with the enclosed cable ties and 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.469
 fix all loose body parts 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.840
