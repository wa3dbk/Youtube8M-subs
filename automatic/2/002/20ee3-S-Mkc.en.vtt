00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.220
 in super mario bros super mario bros 2 and 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.059
 super mario bros 3 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.820
 This is the famous trilogy of the acclaimed 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 Nintendinho the mÃ¡rio is that correct a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 mustache that is entering the pipes in 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 princess peach search 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.789
 in this video we will focus on super mario 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.580
 3 later this game has a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.800
 interesting theory would be the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 mario bros 3 a farce 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.100
 according to a simple theory would be 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 acting in a theater play or 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 everything that happens in the game is false 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.460
 and the player would be the viewer 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 Ok first of all we need to check the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.010
 opening the first two games 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.750
 the Mario 1 and 2 both the games 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.960
 they start with a good opening 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 simple the name of the game appears the music 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 starts and etc. 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.250
 already the super mario bros 3 the opening 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.860
 starts with curtain going up what has already been 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.040
 a starting point of this theory because 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 curtain coming up reminds me a lot of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 theater 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.610
 still in the opening when the lights are 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.580
 linked in you can see the shadows 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 background which may indicate that these lights 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.280
 are conditioned by a light bulb or 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.310
 searchlight and why the floor is squared 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.320
 or sense of it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.990
 basing himself on these facts alone can 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 something totally invalid since a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.060
 theory of this information need 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 more solid for this we go in. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
 of the game 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.970
 there are also small details that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.460
 very reminiscent of a play 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.899
 I'm going to leave a gameplay going on. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.720
 for a few seconds 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.610
 and if you are a detail player go 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.610
 realize what I'm going to say 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.760
 as stated at the beginning of this video 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.810
 you notice background shadows behind the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.069
 platforms and platforms are 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.440
 screwed because it is 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.269
 each one has screws in the corner what 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:40.260
 indicates that they are part of a 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 scenario and still have some platforms 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.709
 hanging on the ceiling but where 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.010
 they hang because he is a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.349
 its open would have nowhere to put 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.540
 and there are other platforms that are 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.540
 moved by something hidden 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.120
 reaching the end of each stage in the goal 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.960
 goes through a black and white area 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.060
 ie without any type of lighting 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.790
 would be the same area as the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.440
 actors come and go to act 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.810
 we 'll never know that these are the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.470
 details that caught the eye of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.780
 many hunters of theories and why 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.240
 not maybe nintendo have thought 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:38.330
 very well in that possibility behind 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:41.180
 of cameras or not and then you believe 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.900
 in this theory if you liked click and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.360
 liked it
