00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
don't think they'd do it but the fact

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.080 
don't think they'd do it but the fact
that<00:01:20.130> they're<00:01:20.310> even<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> mix<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.000> it

that they're even in the mix for it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.370 
that they're even in the mix for it
means<00:01:21.270> they're<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.659> team<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.020> thought
