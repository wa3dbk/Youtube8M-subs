00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.259
 as we portraits with it, too 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.259
 are now in this episode 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.630
 Today we want a little paper 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.060
 taking photos 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.160
 this is not an objective in the sense 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.769
 that we need this time for beautiful 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.660
 Portraits are hard-core it 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.089
 is recommended at least at 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.160
 portraits we can not zoom here 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.949
 but an advantage of a fixed focal length 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.520
 the high intensity is very well known 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.520
 and also very cheap 50 millimeter 18 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.770
 the smaller the value of 18 is the stop 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.289
 the larger is almost the aperture 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.760
 the more light comes into the lens 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.269
 and with it in the camera 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.780
 I'm in darker with that 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.000
 light situations shorter 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.129
 exposure times 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.960
 That's an advantage the second I can 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.190
 in portraits the background of course 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.469
 indemnify much more 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.509
 the more the aperture is open all the more 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.250
 blur would add background 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.200
 landscapes rather unwanted there would like 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.060
 I of course from the front to the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.399
 background a lot of sharpness picture but 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.410
 with portraits I wish above all 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.929
 that the background is beautiful in the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.030
 blur blurred and that goes with it 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.179
 such a tight focal length very well so 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.819
 Anyway, it's definitely worth it 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.009
 50 mm 18 costs less than 100 euros 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.739
 I have you in the video description 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.630
 Once again an investment links the 

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.560
 definitely makes sense for your players 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.599
 flex camera 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 that's why so cheap because 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.610
 So it's a normal focal length here 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.789
 the light is not bent wide angle 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.149
 or for a televereich that is the 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.700
 normal focal length that means so too 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.739
 less expensive production but you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.610
 will be able to achieve a lot with it 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:58.610
 a second objective the whole thing 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.030
 slightly better 85 millimeters at 18 o'clock 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.920
 blender also very bright and same 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 Of course, there's more to this effect here 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.640
 blur it is the same though 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 light intensity but by the higher 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.220
 both of them I have more here as well 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.770
 travel around with blur two 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.109
 portraits we work best here 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.680
 blind mode because we can blind the 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.439
 specify directly 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.810
 such as 18 that he is now blindfolded 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.939
 the objective one makes one 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.409
 also to represent something on 20 because 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.670
 The imaging performance at open 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.590
 Sometimes it does not dazzle them 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.299
 the best thing is and the time 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.829
 Exposure time is taken by the camera 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.510
 automatically set just when you 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.639
 Outside are in sunlight 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.730
 the clouds move over the exposure 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.040
 situation changes that makes the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.599
 camera then automatically the iso value 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.129
 maybe adapt a bit but how 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.290
 I said if I pretend the visor firmly 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.040
 I have the most important thing with it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.409
 already considered very important in portraits 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.889
 it should be focused on eyes 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.230
 become 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.530
 especially with sun have high light intensity 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.879
 but quickly that nose and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.069
 is created or the ears already 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.609
 That's why getting acquainted always 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.900
 on the eyes and the farther the 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.769
 objects like in the background or photo 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.629
 reason 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.489
 the more they blur and exactly 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.819
 we want this effect advantage of us 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.379
 If we put a piece of paper in front of the 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.590
 lens where we have a small hole 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.440
 then we have cut 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.510
 a blur of the paper degree though 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.729
 we work with open blender at 18 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.199
 For example , the object is phono 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.139
 blurred recognizable and gives such a 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.519
 veil over the entire picture can there 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.310
 you experiment with how big you are 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.260
 opening makes what I recommend so that one 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.260
 both hands for photographing freedom 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.780
 You have already seen something together 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.870
 I just glued that over 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.000
 objectively posed 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.340
 and there I have a disturbing factor in the picture 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.769
 and it disappears a bit 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.060
 blur what happens we see it here 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.310
 very nice 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.939
 it is taken out contrast the whole 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.009
 looks a bit softer and that 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.530
 contrast poorer but I also have more 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:10.049
 travel in the processing 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.609
 you have a softer look there and there 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.530
 I can experiment a bit ever 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.750
 after how well I then like that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.109
 big the opening is there so you can 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.209
 already big differences reach yes 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.060
 That was just paper but I can 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.039
 Of course my fingers are the same 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.539
 use is called finger of the lens if 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.990
 I take pictures that I should take a picture 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.920
 his 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.810
 but this time I can consciously 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.090
 set as I so easily on him 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.000
 Bildrand hold and there we see here 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.770
 again a few examples of what is there for 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.360
 an effect is achieved that works like 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.480
 just said with this bright 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.030
 because it's very big 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.030
 blurring foreground also arises and 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.620
 so that such a light really arises 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.330
 Of course you can also use other objects 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.730
 take in front of the camera because you like 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.500
 have fun experimenting 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.210
 try it and finish it 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.160
 few example pictures and see you 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.170
 in a next episode again if you 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.910
 the result has last a thumb 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.860
 there, you can the channel-like 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.490
 Subscribe then you will not miss any episode 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.630
 more 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.630
 until next time
