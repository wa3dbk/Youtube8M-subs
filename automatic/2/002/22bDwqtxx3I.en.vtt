00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.280 
we only shade his courage for coming on
camera<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.240> talk<00:04:02.390> about<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.660> seems<00:04:03.170> like

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
camera to talk about it seems like

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.170 
camera to talk about it seems like
things<00:04:03.410> are<00:04:03.560> okay<00:04:03.590> at<00:04:04.010> high<00:04:04.190> school<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.820> may<00:04:05.120> be

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
things are okay at high school it may be

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.730 
things are okay at high school it may be
in<00:04:05.390> middle<00:04:05.720> schools<00:04:05.990> where<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.320> tough<00:04:06.500> stuff

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
in middle schools where the tough stuff

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.470 
in middle schools where the tough stuff
starts<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.160> think<00:04:07.400> that's<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.700> case<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.180> lot

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
starts I think that's the case for a lot

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.000 
starts I think that's the case for a lot
of<00:04:08.540> kids<00:04:08.840> actually<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.470> can<00:04:09.620> think<00:04:09.710> back<00:04:09.890> to

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
of kids actually and I can think back to

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.050 
of kids actually and I can think back to
middle<00:04:10.220> school<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.520> think<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.790> middle

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
middle school and think that middle

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.430 
middle school and think that middle
school<00:04:11.240> seemed<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.480> lot<00:04:11.600> worse<00:04:11.780> actually<00:04:12.080> but

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
school seemed a lot worse actually but

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.960 
school seemed a lot worse actually but
the<00:04:12.800> principal<00:04:13.160> tells<00:04:13.370> us<00:04:13.580> they've<00:04:13.730> thought

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
the principal tells us they've thought

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.220 
the principal tells us they've thought
about<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.510> they<00:04:14.600> think<00:04:14.810> may<00:04:14.930> be<00:04:14.990> sending

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
about that and they think may be sending

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.660 
about that and they think may be sending
Brock<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.800> group<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.070> kids<00:04:16.280> into<00:04:16.580> the

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
Brock and a group of kids into the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.590 
Brock and a group of kids into the
middle<00:04:16.880> school<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.210> spread<00:04:17.450> their<00:04:17.570> message

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
middle school to spread their message

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.850 
middle school to spread their message
would<00:04:17.989> be<00:04:18.080> good<00:04:18.260> because<00:04:18.500> they<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.710> work

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
would be good because they have to work

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.710 
would be good because they have to work
so<00:04:19.040> hard<00:04:19.220> when<00:04:19.790> freshmen<00:04:20.239> come<00:04:20.420> in<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
so hard when freshmen come in to the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.880 
so hard when freshmen come in to the
high<00:04:20.840> school<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.140> say<00:04:21.320> this<00:04:21.500> isn't<00:04:21.710> going<00:04:21.800> to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
high school to say this isn't going to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.070 
high school to say this isn't going to
be<00:04:21.950> tolerated<00:04:22.340> here<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:22.850> stopping<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.780> sooner

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
be tolerated here so stopping it sooner

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.840 
be tolerated here so stopping it sooner
and<00:04:24.260> maybe<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.890> never<00:04:25.010> know<00:04:25.250> saving<00:04:25.670> a<00:04:25.730> life

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
and maybe you never know saving a life

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.670 
and maybe you never know saving a life
