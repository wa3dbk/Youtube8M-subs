of seven millimeter radius it does mean

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299

the<00:00:33.600> edges<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.260> bit<00:00:34.559> smaller<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the edges are a little bit smaller of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.549 
the edges are a little bit smaller of
course<00:00:35.480> these<00:00:36.480> ones<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.809> 33

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
course these ones actually 33

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
course these ones actually 33
millimeters<00:00:38.300> but<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.629> decent

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
millimeters but you know it's decent

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
millimeters but you know it's decent
sized<00:00:40.320> edge<00:00:40.730> not<00:00:41.730> massive<00:00:42.210> I've<00:00:42.360> today<00:00:42.570> stands

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sized edge not massive I've today stands

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.709 
sized edge not massive I've today stands
with<00:00:43.020> decent<00:00:43.500> size<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> 2<00:00:44.129> pound<00:00:44.370> 10<00:00:44.670> bat<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
with decent size a 2 pound 10 bat so you

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.770 
with decent size a 2 pound 10 bat so you
know<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.739> good<00:00:46.950> size<00:00:47.190> still<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.450> bats

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
know pretty good size still this bats

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.830 
know pretty good size still this bats
actually<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.170> long<00:00:49.410> handle<00:00:50.629> certainly<00:00:51.629> better

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
actually a long handle certainly better

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
actually a long handle certainly better
suited<00:00:52.230> for<00:00:52.289> batsman<00:00:53.190> who<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.370> 6<00:00:53.579> foot<00:00:53.699> 2<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
suited for batsman who is 6 foot 2 and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
suited for batsman who is 6 foot 2 and
above<00:00:54.239> generally<00:00:55.079> speaking<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:56.370> 6

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
above generally speaking I'm actually 6

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
above generally speaking I'm actually 6
foot<00:00:56.850> 5<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.020> used<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> long<00:00:58.920> handle

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
foot 5 and I used to use a long handle

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.189 
foot 5 and I used to use a long handle
but<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> don't<00:00:59.579> anymore

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
but I don't anymore

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
but I don't anymore
so<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.859> saying<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.699> size

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so it's not saying if you're that size

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
so it's not saying if you're that size
you<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> should

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you you have to use it or you should

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
you you have to use it or you should
definitely<00:01:05.010> use<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.339> personally<00:01:05.400> fidgeted

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
definitely use it i personally fidgeted

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
definitely use it i personally fidgeted
a<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> earth<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:07.979> grip

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
a bit with the earth to get my grip

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
a bit with the earth to get my grip
right<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.030> i've<00:01:09.479> done<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.720> other<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.110> have

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

right and i've done if other people have
the<00:01:10.260> same<00:01:10.320> problem<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:12.060> yeah<00:01:12.210> it's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the same problem but but yeah it's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
the same problem but but yeah it's
something<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> bear<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.869> mind<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.340> but

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
something to bear in mind but it is but

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.950 
something to bear in mind but it is but
definitely<00:01:14.970> better<00:01:15.060> suited<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
definitely better suited to the to a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
definitely better suited to the to a
pair<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> course<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.670> taller<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
pair of course and if you are taller it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
pair of course and if you are taller it
does<00:01:18.330> make<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> easy<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> those

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
does make it easy to get down to those

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
does make it easy to get down to those
yorkers<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.250> things<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.689> i'm

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
yorkers and things like that but i'm

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this case we have a 5 star which is that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
this case we have a 5 star which is that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
the back similar story got pretty much

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.620 
the back similar story got pretty much
straight<00:02:08.920> grains<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.550> very<00:02:10.119> nice<00:02:10.300> down<00:02:10.599> there

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
straight grains a very nice down there

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.850 
straight grains a very nice down there
and<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.160> far<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.489> start<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and and it's a far to start back and I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.260 
and and it's a far to start back and I
certainly<00:02:14.860> haven't<00:02:15.130> seen<00:02:15.250> any<00:02:15.520> 5-star<00:02:16.030> bats

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
certainly haven't seen any 5-star bats

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.600 
certainly haven't seen any 5-star bats
that<00:02:16.450> look<00:02:16.630> quite<00:02:17.500> as<00:02:17.560> nice<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.400> didn't

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that look quite as nice as this I didn't

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.710 
that look quite as nice as this I didn't
when<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:18.850> there<00:02:19.060> anyway<00:02:19.239> though<00:02:19.540> there

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
when I was there anyway though there

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.900 
when I was there anyway though there
might<00:02:19.840> have<00:02:20.050> been<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.709> but<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.700> yeah

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
might have been some but but yeah

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.090 
might have been some but but yeah
usually<00:02:22.630> you'd<00:02:22.870> expect<00:02:23.260> any<00:02:23.410> about<00:02:23.620> six<00:02:23.860> seven

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
usually you'd expect any about six seven

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.680 
usually you'd expect any about six seven
grains<00:02:24.430> people<00:02:24.880> Emma<00:02:24.970> she's<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.390> kind<00:02:25.569> of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
grains people Emma she's that kind of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.150 
grains people Emma she's that kind of
thing<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.709> one<00:02:26.769> which<00:02:27.130> is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
thing but not on this one which is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.620 
thing but not on this one which is
really<00:02:27.430> pleasing<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.819> see<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.060> think<00:02:28.330> I've<00:02:28.480> seen

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
really pleasing to see I think I've seen

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.420 
really pleasing to see I think I've seen
players<00:02:28.900> bats<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.440> look<00:02:30.030> uglier<00:02:31.030> than<00:02:31.180> this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
players bats that look uglier than this

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.490 
players bats that look uglier than this
so<00:02:33.430> yeah<00:02:33.610> that's<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.480> rundown<00:02:35.350> of

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
so yeah that's that's the rundown of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.940 
so yeah that's that's the rundown of
that<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> profile<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.200> say<00:02:38.620> no<00:02:38.769> real

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that the profile and I say no real

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.680 
that the profile and I say no real
change<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.450> very<00:02:40.840> concave<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:43.120> sweet

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
change it's a very concave the sweet

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.720 
change it's a very concave the sweet
spot<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.810> again<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> other

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
spot is there so again like the other

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000 
spot is there so again like the other
its<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.780> used<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> low<00:02:50.470> middle<00:02:50.739> on<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
its it used to be a low middle on the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.789 
its it used to be a low middle on the
Oblivion<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:52.209> from<00:02:52.720> last<00:02:52.930> year<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.230> think<00:02:53.620> it

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
Oblivion but from last year I think it

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.350 
Oblivion but from last year I think it
was<00:02:53.950> there<00:02:54.130> they<00:02:54.280> updated<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.030> moved<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.330> a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
was there they updated and moved it a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.830 
was there they updated and moved it a
bit<00:02:55.480> higher<00:02:55.750> up<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.049> blade<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:57.730> now<00:02:57.940> it's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
bit higher up the blade right now it's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
bit higher up the blade right now it's
still<00:02:59.080> no<00:02:59.290> ish<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.769> it's<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.069> mid<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
still no ish but it's more mid really to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.750 
still no ish but it's more mid really to
a<00:03:01.000> medium<00:03:01.540> sweet<00:03:02.019> like<00:03:02.860> pretty<00:03:03.250> much<00:03:03.430> all<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
a medium sweet like pretty much all the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.190 
a medium sweet like pretty much all the
other<00:03:03.880> grain<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.269> comes<00:03:04.450> bats<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.900> they<00:03:05.079> have

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
other grain it comes bats are they have

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.130 
other grain it comes bats are they have
this<00:03:05.320> mid<00:03:05.890> middle<00:03:06.510> which<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.540> great<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
this mid middle which is great in the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.319 
this mid middle which is great in the
sense<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.920> front<00:03:09.609> foot<00:03:09.850> play<00:03:10.060> back

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
sense that it is front foot play back

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.479 
sense that it is front foot play back
foot<00:03:10.570> play<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:11.350> suitable<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:12.040> different

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
foot play it's suitable for different

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.120 
foot play it's suitable for different
wickets<00:03:13.060> different<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.989> know<00:03:14.109> fast<00:03:14.680> pitches

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
wickets different you know fast pitches

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.430 
wickets different you know fast pitches
slow<00:03:15.400> pitches<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.870> kind<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.230> thing

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
slow pitches that kind of thing

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.380 
slow pitches that kind of thing
different<00:03:18.010> conditions<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:18.940> not

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
different conditions it is not

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.130 
different conditions it is not
unsuitable<00:03:20.290> for<00:03:20.320> any<00:03:20.769> particular<00:03:20.980> batsman<00:03:22.140> it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
unsuitable for any particular batsman it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.650 
unsuitable for any particular batsman it
covers<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> wide<00:03:24.060> global<00:03:25.060> audience<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.630> I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
covers a wide global audience and I

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.759 
covers a wide global audience and I
think<00:03:25.870> that's<00:03:25.989> when<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.200> reasons<00:03:26.500> grain

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
think that's when the reasons grain

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.410 
think that's when the reasons grain
occurs<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.579> because<00:03:27.730> obviously

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
occurs like to do it because obviously

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.150 
occurs like to do it because obviously
they're<00:03:28.959> selling<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.380> large<00:03:29.680> volumes

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
they're selling in large volumes

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.910 
they're selling in large volumes
