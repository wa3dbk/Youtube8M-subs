00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
initial pulse initial thoughts would be

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
initial pulse initial thoughts would be
that<00:00:45.120> India<00:00:45.510> definitely<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.680> stronger

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that India definitely has the stronger

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
that India definitely has the stronger
batting<00:00:47.489> lineup<00:00:47.640> even<00:00:48.090> though<00:00:48.350> England<00:00:49.350> are

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
batting lineup even though England are

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.240 
batting lineup even though England are
not<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.300> weak<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.840> would<00:00:52.230> say<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
not as weak as you would say but

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
not as weak as you would say but
compared<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.360> India<00:00:54.719> I'd<00:00:55.050> say<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.739> know

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
compared to India I'd say you know

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.770 
compared to India I'd say you know
they're<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.550> weaker<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> sense<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
they're a bit weaker in the sense that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810
