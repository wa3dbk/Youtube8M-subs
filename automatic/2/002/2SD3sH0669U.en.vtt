00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.180
 Secondary actor will have two water flaps 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.770
 by m w 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.720
 you see in the custom tab that the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.260
 slightly more outdated interface of the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.810
 program you will click here 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.390
 this select button surrenders 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.940
 here you will select one 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.230
 color that will stay in the video and that the rest 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.180
 It's going to turn black and white. 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.240
 I will not select the one that is stronger 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.480
 that in the red case click here in the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.850
 red car and now you're going to do 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.600
 the following will mark a box that 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.860
 reverse but here he told me you're going 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 see what's left the market 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.590
 low and the maximum radius is 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.910
 current limits times is to do the same 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.090
 thing at least ray at maximum to iacc 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 in saturation such a secret of effect you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.520
 will put the garbage bag to a minimum and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.800
 will see that everything that is not red goes 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.720
 become black and white the saturated city 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.610
 just see that you did not predict that everything is 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.750
 Black and white only is red're 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.570
 appearing but also see that the skin 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.820
 of the people in the video is looking like 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.239
 A little bit, you just need to fiddle 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.600
 here in the river center border and you go 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.370
 to be able to define there is that red that goes 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.080
 will it appear red and not 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.420
 It's going to show up there. 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.890
 here in this slider 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.900
 it will set what appears to not 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.739
 appears to let you 96 coast that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.239
 it's nice 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.430
 Then you can apply a smoothie there. 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.709
 make the red a little softer on the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.300
 time to appear on the show takes more 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.280
 be careful when selecting red 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.900
 will appear the red that does not go there 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.900
 Look how our video looks. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 here in sony vegas guys if you are 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.200
 apply this effect to a color that is 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.390
 between red between green and blue 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.250
 it may not work very well for 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.569
 example if it will apply in pink 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.840
 it may appear a bit 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.640
 a little red there yellow there too 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.500
 if you will apply on the yellow itself 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.599
 will appear the red will appear the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 green too so you have to take 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.799
 Be careful with that, there you have it 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.859
 select only the primary colors in the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.150
 The video case is red blue and 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.750
 green 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.430
 That's why it's called rgb hedbo in blue. 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.980
