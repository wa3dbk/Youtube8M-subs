00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.560 
then for the last Pokemon we decided to
give<00:04:07.459> ourselves<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.910> challenge<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.480> we're

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
give ourselves a challenge and we're

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.990 
give ourselves a challenge and we're
gonna<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.959> it<00:04:09.200> from<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.560> generation<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.220> we're

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
gonna do it from a generation that we're

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.610 
gonna do it from a generation that we're
not<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.150> familiar<00:04:11.480> with<00:04:11.780> okay<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.590> last

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
not very familiar with okay so the last

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.660 
not very familiar with okay so the last
one<00:04:13.040> is

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
one is

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.030 
one is
horn<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:19.120> neither<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.840> sounds<00:04:21.139> like<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.500> big

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
horn and neither so it sounds like a big

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.240 
horn and neither so it sounds like a big
Pokemon<00:04:22.820> one<00:04:23.480> I'm<00:04:24.020> assuming<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.590> has<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> thorn

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
Pokemon one I'm assuming it has a thorn

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.100 
Pokemon one I'm assuming it has a thorn
like<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.120> horn<00:04:26.389> or<00:04:26.540> something<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.110> helps

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
like a horn or something so that helps

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.710 
like a horn or something so that helps
destroy<00:04:30.110> me<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:30.800> draw<00:04:30.919> like<00:04:31.100> another<00:04:31.370> see
