rear facing cameras and then we'll go

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.299 
rear facing cameras and then we'll go
indoors<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> test<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.920> low-light

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
indoors and test out some low-light

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:38.720 
indoors and test out some low-light
shots

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
shots

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.910 
shots
-<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.420> hit<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.600> thumbs<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:40.050> 1<00:00:40.230> let's<00:00:40.739> get

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
- so do hit that thumbs up 1 let's get

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.530 
- so do hit that thumbs up 1 let's get
straight<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.030> outdoors

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
straight to it so we're now outdoors

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.690 
straight to it so we're now outdoors
with<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> both<00:00:43.260> devices<00:00:43.890> we'll<00:00:44.370> film<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.579> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
with the both devices we'll film in at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.560 
with the both devices we'll film in at
1080p<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.590> s6<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.309> turn<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> 4k<00:00:48.059> but

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
1080p the s6 can turn one up to 4k but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
1080p the s6 can turn one up to 4k but
we'll<00:00:48.750> check<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> second<00:00:49.829> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we'll check that out in a second just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610 
we'll check that out in a second just
checking<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> stabilization<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.320> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
checking the stabilization here so just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
checking the stabilization here so just
taking<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> walk<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.520> both<00:00:53.850> devices

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
taking a bit of walk with both devices

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.590 
taking a bit of walk with both devices
handheld<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.910> optical<00:00:57.390> image

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
handheld now you do have optical image

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
handheld now you do have optical image
stabilization<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> s6<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.059> iPhone<00:01:00.390> 6

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
stabilization on the s6 on the iPhone 6

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
stabilization on the s6 on the iPhone 6
it<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.079> digital<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> sort

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
it is only digital so this is the sort

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
it is only digital so this is the sort
of<00:01:02.910> quality<00:01:03.359> difference<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of quality difference that you can

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.090 
of quality difference that you can
expect<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.640> filming<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.180> full<00:01:06.869> 4k<00:01:07.619> on

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
expect now we're filming at full 4k on

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.140 
expect now we're filming at full 4k on
the<00:01:08.760> s6<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:10.860> 1080p<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> max

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the s6 and we are at 1080p at the max

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
the s6 and we are at 1080p at the max
which<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.260> iPhone<00:01:13.530> 6<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
which is on the iPhone 6 so this is just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.940 
which is on the iPhone 6 so this is just
to<00:01:15.030> show<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.110> difference<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to show you the difference in the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
to show you the difference in the
quality<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.850> does<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.570> crop<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
quality this does mean we can crop in in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.510 
quality this does mean we can crop in in
to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> 4k<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.490> exported<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.180> 1080p<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.400> now

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
to the 4k when exported at 1080p so now

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149 
to the 4k when exported at 1080p so now
we're<00:01:23.670> indoors<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.570> Samsung<00:01:25.259> Galaxy<00:01:25.650> s6

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
we're indoors with the Samsung Galaxy s6

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.429 
we're indoors with the Samsung Galaxy s6
in<00:01:26.460> relatively<00:01:26.909> low<00:01:27.119> light<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> testing

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
in relatively low light and just testing

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
in relatively low light and just testing
out<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> autofocus<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.270> one

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
out the autofocus so going from one

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.440 
out the autofocus so going from one
place<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.079> another<00:01:31.460> seems<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
place to another seems to be doing a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.340 
place to another seems to be doing a
pretty<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:33.960> job

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
pretty good job

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.539 
pretty good job
now<00:01:34.799> same<00:01:35.100> lighting<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> iPhone<00:01:36.360> 6<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.549> we

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
now same lighting on the iPhone 6 and we

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
now same lighting on the iPhone 6 and we
are<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.210> testing<00:01:39.329> our<00:01:39.540> view<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> focus

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
are just testing our view of the focus

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
are just testing our view of the focus
once<00:01:40.290> again<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.310> seems<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.119> doing

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
once again it also seems to be doing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.230 
once again it also seems to be doing
pretty<00:01:42.750> well<00:01:42.930> from<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> background

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
pretty well from going in the background

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
pretty well from going in the background
to<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> foreground<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.649> quick<00:01:46.860> test

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to the foreground now just a quick test

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
to the foreground now just a quick test
side-by-side<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
side-by-side so you can see the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.190 
side-by-side so you can see the
low-light<00:01:48.930> performance<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.680> auto<00:01:49.860> focusing

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
low-light performance and auto focusing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
low-light performance and auto focusing
side-by-side<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.799> picture<00:01:53.130> does<00:01:53.340> seem

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
side-by-side the picture does seem

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.200 
side-by-side the picture does seem
brighter<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.630> s6<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.820> autofocus

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
brighter on the s6 and the autofocus

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.600 
brighter on the s6 and the autofocus
seems<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.350> bit<00:01:58.500> quicker<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
seems to be a little bit quicker on the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.929 
seems to be a little bit quicker on the
iPhone<00:02:00.149> 6<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.649> interesting<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
iPhone 6 so that's interesting to see so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.130 
iPhone 6 so that's interesting to see so
that<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> video<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.689> let's<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> look

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
preferred brand so needs to be starting

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.140 
preferred brand so needs to be starting
off<00:02:19.350> with<00:02:19.530> some<00:02:19.860> selfies<00:02:20.400> we've<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:21.030> some

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
off with some selfies we've got some

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.760 
off with some selfies we've got some
selfies<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.540> my<00:02:21.630> car<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.140> thought<00:02:22.380> I'd<00:02:22.530> change

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
selfies in my car I thought I'd change

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.800 
selfies in my car I thought I'd change
it<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> little<00:02:23.070> bit<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:24.030> straight<00:02:24.630> away<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
it up a little bit now straight away I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
it up a little bit now straight away I
think<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> right-hand<00:02:25.740> side<00:02:25.920> image<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.370> doing

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
think the right-hand side image is doing

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.760 
think the right-hand side image is doing
much<00:02:26.820> better<00:02:26.850> here<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> lot<00:02:27.840> sharper<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
much better here it's a lot sharper and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.470 
much better here it's a lot sharper and
the<00:02:29.460> colors<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> little<00:02:30.000> bit<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
the colors are a little bit on the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.870 
the colors are a little bit on the
vibrant<00:02:30.840> side<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.920> definitely<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.580> lot

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
vibrant side but it definitely is a lot

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.090 
vibrant side but it definitely is a lot
sharper<00:02:33.120> which<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.320> that's<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
sharper which I really do like that's of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.670 
sharper which I really do like that's of
the<00:02:35.220> s6<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.820> we've<00:02:36.060> got<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.330> iPhone<00:02:36.750> 6<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the s6 and we've got the iPhone 6 on the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680 
the s6 and we've got the iPhone 6 on the
left-hand<00:02:38.160> side<00:02:38.370> now<00:02:39.030> another<00:02:39.240> thing<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> bear

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
left-hand side now another thing to bear

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500 
left-hand side now another thing to bear
in<00:02:39.720> mind<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.980> iPhone<00:02:41.250> 6<00:02:41.490> has<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:42.060> 1.2

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
in mind is that the iPhone 6 has a 1.2

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.380 
in mind is that the iPhone 6 has a 1.2
megapixel<00:02:42.870> front<00:02:43.290> facing<00:02:43.320> camera<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.030> s6<00:02:45.030> has

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
megapixel front facing camera the s6 has

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.600 
megapixel front facing camera the s6 has
a<00:02:45.600> 5<00:02:45.810> megapixel<00:02:46.140> front<00:02:46.590> facing<00:02:46.650> camera<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
a 5 megapixel front facing camera and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
a 5 megapixel front facing camera and
this<00:02:47.670> means<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.180> crop<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.630> much<00:02:48.960> further

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
this means you can crop in much further

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.340 
this means you can crop in much further
on<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.280> s6<00:02:50.460> then<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.240> do<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:52.020> iPhone

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
on the s6 then you can do on the iPhone

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.890 
on the s6 then you can do on the iPhone
6<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.280> just<00:02:53.760> something<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.300> bear<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.480> mind<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
6 so just something to bear in mind and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
6 so just something to bear in mind and
moving<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> low-light<00:02:56.010> selfie<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.580> is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
moving on to a low-light selfie this is

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.370 
moving on to a low-light selfie this is
something<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> lot<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.080> asked

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
something that a lot of you have asked

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.380 
something that a lot of you have asked
for<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> colors<00:02:59.760> better<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
for now I like the colors better on the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600 
for now I like the colors better on the
left-hand<00:03:00.810> side<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.890> right-hand<00:03:02.430> side

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
left-hand side but the right-hand side

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.270 
left-hand side but the right-hand side
image<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.510> sharper<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:05.100> looks

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
image is a little sharper so it looks

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040 
image is a little sharper so it looks
like<00:03:05.459> there's<00:03:05.760> some<00:03:05.940> software<00:03:06.240> magic

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
like there's some software magic

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.960 
like there's some software magic
happening<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.830> left<00:03:08.070> hand<00:03:08.280> side<00:03:08.490> image

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
happening on the left hand side image

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.930 
happening on the left hand side image
which<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> s6<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.650> we've<00:03:11.430> got<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
which is of the s6 and we've got the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
which is of the s6 and we've got the
iPhone<00:03:12.240> 6<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.959> right-hand<00:03:13.380> side<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.010> this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
iPhone 6 on the right-hand side so this

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550 
iPhone 6 on the right-hand side so this
is<00:03:15.000> interesting<00:03:15.810> I'll<00:03:15.900> let<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.170> guys<00:03:16.350> decide

to some outdoor images so we've got some
flowers<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.390> think<00:03:21.630> both<00:03:21.780> are<00:03:21.810> doing<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
flowers here I think both are doing a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.350 
flowers here I think both are doing a
good<00:03:22.769> job<00:03:22.830> you've<00:03:23.430> got<00:03:23.670> some<00:03:23.820> differences<00:03:24.300> in

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
good job you've got some differences in

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.660 
good job you've got some differences in
sharpness<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.380> colors<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.890> personally<00:03:26.550> do

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
sharpness and colors I personally do

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.100 
sharpness and colors I personally do
prefer<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> sharpness<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.600> colors<00:03:27.810> on<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
prefer the sharpness and colors on the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.320 
prefer the sharpness and colors on the
right<00:03:28.140> side<00:03:28.620> image<00:03:28.830> that's<00:03:29.250> off<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.670> s6<00:03:30.120> we've

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
right side image that's off the s6 we've

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.210 
right side image that's off the s6 we've
got<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.570> iPhone<00:03:30.870> 6<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.500> left-hand<00:03:31.920> side

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
got the iPhone 6 on the left-hand side

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.280 
got the iPhone 6 on the left-hand side
now<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.610> do<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:32.850> an<00:03:33.120> 8<00:03:33.330> megapixel<00:03:33.840> camera<00:03:33.870> on

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
now you do have an 8 megapixel camera on

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560 
now you do have an 8 megapixel camera on
the<00:03:34.530> iPhone<00:03:34.620> 6<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.519> essex<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.209> 16

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the iPhone 6 on the essex it's a 16

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.630 
the iPhone 6 on the essex it's a 16
megapixel<00:03:36.720> rear<00:03:37.230> facing<00:03:37.260> camera<00:03:37.920> now<00:03:38.459> this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
megapixel rear facing camera now this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.640 
megapixel rear facing camera now this
also<00:03:38.850> means<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.330> can<00:03:39.480> crop<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:39.930> much<00:03:40.350> further

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
also means you can crop in much further

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.759 
also means you can crop in much further
on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> s6<00:03:41.280> then<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.090> can<00:03:42.300> do<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.320> iPhone

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
on the s6 then you can do on the iPhone

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.580 
on the s6 then you can do on the iPhone
6<00:03:44.010> these<00:03:44.310> are<00:03:44.370> both<00:03:44.640> images<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:45.180> 100%<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.050> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
6 these are both images at 100% and the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.840 
6 these are both images at 100% and the
amount<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.800> detail<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.310> you've<00:03:47.430> gotten<00:03:47.670> both

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
amount of detail that you've gotten both

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.640 
amount of detail that you've gotten both
images<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.360> absolutely<00:03:48.870> great<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.530> edge

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
images is absolutely great but the edge

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.040 
images is absolutely great but the edge
does<00:03:49.950> go<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.310> s6<00:03:50.880> because<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.780> high

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
does go to the s6 because of that high

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.750 
does go to the s6 because of that high
resolution<00:03:52.709> now<00:03:52.920> moving<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.519> an<00:03:53.610> outdoor

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
resolution now moving on to an outdoor

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.270 
resolution now moving on to an outdoor
wide<00:03:54.510> image<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.350> both<00:03:55.769> are<00:03:55.920> doing<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.130> decent

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
wide image so both are doing a decent

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.370 
wide image so both are doing a decent
job<00:03:56.610> but<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:57.000> prefer<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.570> contrast<00:03:58.200> and

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
job but I do prefer the contrast and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.810 
job but I do prefer the contrast and
sharpness<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.040> left<00:03:59.220> hand<00:03:59.400> side<00:03:59.550> image

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
sharpness on the left hand side image

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.000 
sharpness on the left hand side image
the<00:04:00.480> right<00:04:00.930> hand<00:04:01.050> side<00:04:01.170> image<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.800> bad

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the right hand side image is not so bad

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.590 
the right hand side image is not so bad
but<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.760> seems<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.150> bit<00:04:03.300> washed

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
but it just seems a little bit washed

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.240 
but it just seems a little bit washed
out<00:04:03.989> you've<00:04:04.200> got<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.410> s6<00:04:04.709> on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.890> left<00:04:05.070> hand

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
out you've got the s6 on the left hand

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.430 
out you've got the s6 on the left hand
side<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> iPhone<00:04:05.970> 6<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.810> right<00:04:07.170> hand<00:04:07.380> side

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
side the iPhone 6 on the right hand side

side the iPhone 6 on the right hand side
now<00:04:08.010> moving<00:04:08.190> on<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.970> an<00:04:09.360> imaging<00:04:09.690> good<00:04:09.840> light

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
now moving on to an imaging good light

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.860 
now moving on to an imaging good light
indoors<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:11.280> both<00:04:11.459> are<00:04:11.700> pretty<00:04:12.090> much<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
indoors I think both are pretty much the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.990 
indoors I think both are pretty much the
same<00:04:13.049> here<00:04:13.290> they're<00:04:13.500> both<00:04:13.680> doing<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.280> good<00:04:14.940> job

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
same here they're both doing a good job

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.370 
same here they're both doing a good job
I<00:04:15.360> can't<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:15.690> see<00:04:15.900> much<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.229> difference

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
I can't really see much of a difference

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.650 
I can't really see much of a difference
we've<00:04:17.220> got<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.459> s6<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> left<00:04:18.180> hand<00:04:18.419> side

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
we've got the s6 on the left hand side

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.390 
we've got the s6 on the left hand side
and<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> iPhone<00:04:19.350> 6<00:04:19.620> on<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.220> hand<00:04:20.370> side

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
and the iPhone 6 on the right hand side

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
and the iPhone 6 on the right hand side
I'm<00:04:20.729> gonna<00:04:20.880> call<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.419> draw<00:04:21.510> now

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
I'm gonna call this one a draw now

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.650 
I'm gonna call this one a draw now
moving<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.950> low-light<00:04:23.520> shots<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.330> these

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
moving on to low-light shots so these

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.020 
moving on to low-light shots so these
are<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.169> relatively<00:04:25.560> low<00:04:25.770> light<00:04:25.979> indoors

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
are in relatively low light indoors

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.640 
are in relatively low light indoors
I<00:04:27.090> personally<00:04:27.630> prefer<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.930> right-hand-side

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
I personally prefer the right-hand-side

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.260 
I personally prefer the right-hand-side
image<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.190> little<00:04:29.340> bit<00:04:29.490> more<00:04:29.760> I<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.180> you've

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
image a little bit more I think you've

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.240 
image a little bit more I think you've
got<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.450> little<00:04:30.570> more<00:04:30.810> contrast<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
got a little more contrast and the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.040 
got a little more contrast and the
colors<00:04:32.610> are<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.850> little<00:04:33.150> bit<00:04:33.420> better<00:04:33.570> on<00:04:33.810> here

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
colors are a little bit better on here

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.990 
colors are a little bit better on here
that's<00:04:34.230> off<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.410> s6<00:04:34.889> we've<00:04:35.100> got<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.400> iPhone<00:04:35.730> 6

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
that's off the s6 we've got the iPhone 6

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.180 
that's off the s6 we've got the iPhone 6
on<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> left-hand<00:04:36.720> side<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.200> finally<00:04:37.650> an

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
on the left-hand side and finally an

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.490 
on the left-hand side and finally an
image<00:04:38.490> with<00:04:38.700> flash<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.360> personally<00:04:40.080> prefer<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
image with flash I personally prefer the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.780 
image with flash I personally prefer the
right-hand<00:04:40.860> side<00:04:41.010> image<00:04:41.220> more<00:04:41.430> here<00:04:41.639> because

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
right-hand side image more here because

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.860 
right-hand side image more here because
I<00:04:41.970> think<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.210> colors<00:04:42.480> are<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.600> little<00:04:42.660> bit

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
I think the colors are a little bit

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.300 
I think the colors are a little bit
better<00:04:42.990> if<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.200> look<00:04:43.320> at<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.470> table<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.980> can

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
better if you look at the table you can

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.800 
better if you look at the table you can
see<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.820> colors<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.180> been<00:04:45.240> maintained<00:04:45.720> a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
see the colors have been maintained a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.510 
see the colors have been maintained a
little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.200> better<00:04:46.410> whereas<00:04:46.889> only<00:04:47.400> been

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
little bit better whereas only been

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.030 
little bit better whereas only been
washed<00:04:47.760> out<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:49.050> left-hand<00:04:49.590> side<00:04:49.650> image

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
washed out on the left-hand side image

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.310 
washed out on the left-hand side image
we've<00:04:50.430> got<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.669> iPhone<00:04:50.970> 6<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:52.050> right-hand

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
we've got the iPhone 6 on the right-hand

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200 
we've got the iPhone 6 on the right-hand
side<00:04:52.410> whereas<00:04:53.100> we've<00:04:53.220> got<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.520> S<00:04:53.639> 6<00:04:53.910> on<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
side whereas we've got the S 6 on the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.300 
side whereas we've got the S 6 on the
left-hand<00:04:54.600> side<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.290> there<00:04:55.560> we<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.040> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
left-hand side so there we have it the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.670 
left-hand side so there we have it the
camera<00:04:56.610> comparison<00:04:57.180> now<00:04:57.660> overall<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.470> think

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
camera comparison now overall I think

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.040 
camera comparison now overall I think
both<00:04:59.010> are<00:04:59.220> doing<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.490> good<00:04:59.640> job<00:04:59.700> I<00:05:00.150> would<00:05:00.600> give

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
both are doing a good job I would give

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.050 
both are doing a good job I would give
the<00:05:01.260> overall<00:05:01.530> edge<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.130> s6<00:05:02.550> you've<00:05:02.820> got

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the overall edge to the s6 you've got

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.370 
the overall edge to the s6 you've got
optical<00:05:03.510> image<00:05:03.690> stabilization<00:05:04.020> which

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
optical image stabilization which

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.200 
optical image stabilization which
definitely<00:05:05.010> does<00:05:05.190> help<00:05:05.430> in<00:05:05.760> terms<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.090> that

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
definitely does help in terms of that

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.900 
definitely does help in terms of that
video<00:05:06.480> you've<00:05:06.750> also<00:05:06.870> got<00:05:07.140> 4k<00:05:07.620> video<00:05:07.919> on<00:05:08.190> that

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
video you've also got 4k video on that

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.880 
video you've also got 4k video on that
high<00:05:09.060> resolution<00:05:09.660> with<00:05:09.870> some<00:05:10.200> more<00:05:10.350> sharpness

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
high resolution with some more sharpness

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.550 
high resolution with some more sharpness
now<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.580> s6<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.210> newer<00:05:12.600> it's<00:05:12.990> six<00:05:13.410> months

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
now the s6 is newer it's six months

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.380 
now the s6 is newer it's six months
newer<00:05:13.800> compared<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.280> iPhone<00:05:14.400> 6<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.150> some

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
newer compared to the iPhone 6 so some

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.330 
newer compared to the iPhone 6 so some
of<00:05:15.419> these<00:05:15.570> things<00:05:15.900> are<00:05:16.110> expected<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.950> no

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
of these things are expected and no

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.680 
of these things are expected and no
doubt<00:05:17.520> we<00:05:17.730> will<00:05:17.850> do<00:05:18.060> under<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.479> camera

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
doubt we will do under the camera

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.200 
doubt we will do under the camera
comparison<00:05:19.410> with<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.979> iPhone<00:05:20.400> 6s<00:05:20.790> when
