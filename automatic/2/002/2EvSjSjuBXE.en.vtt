00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello to all guys welcome to the new one 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.460
 official nikci video 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.430
 then guys the first time 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.500
 let's make a specific video on a 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.539
 video game because the readers of pop rates 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.969
 we cannot consider them as a mixture 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.129
 then among the video game manga everything 

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.989
 this we say that at the inauguration 

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.789
 of the video game column today 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.530
 guys we're here to tell you about the new ones 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.260
 Pokémon games that will be released in October 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.940
 or pokémon xy craft with ours 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.460
 impressions what struck us is 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 what we hope to see the know-how 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.680
 that we are offered are usually three 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.600
 grass co types and fire chest inter is fine 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.620
 that of fire and among those who water it 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 feature that distinguishes 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.640
 mainly this instant from those 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.450
 previous is the second type of these 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
 doc but no one knows 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.920
 fennec in second of the rumors will be of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.290
 psycho fire type indeed in the demo that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.270
 came out a few days ago the pokémon of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.490
 it was just a kind of psi courage 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.500
 certain type dark grass and fires accepted 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.540
 from the face of these is to the staff 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.759
 therefore preferred really premium little gold 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.799
 in every type of grass there is spin I can do the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.389
 pokémon ass of fire type since web 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.709
 as it will be dark among my type 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.719
 regarding my choice 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.909
 I believe he will take offense 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.619
 because attached by the type fire type 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.689
 psycho therefore file that for me is perfect 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.130
 I will choose thing since being the 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.229
 dark are more typical I have always been 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.060
 liked and then physically it is very beautiful 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.679
 a new introduction precisely and cured 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.290
 the new type is the goblin type that 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.290
 it will be super effective when 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 and already there e-mail that will make the ass seems to me 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.260
 bullshit, however, let's leave it alone 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.590
 speaking of gidari drowned botox ernest 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.330
 indeed take that many x7 game though 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.100
 just the legendary goblin type la 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 stability and a pixie that is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.430
 enhances the things of all pokémon 's 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 sprite type in the field including those 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.630
 of the opponent as for parks and there was 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.120
 a thing of space for scenes at yes 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.520
 the message will check the second 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.979
 legendary trucks even if they are not 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 it's dark flying type stability will be a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.030
 a tetra or enhance the moves of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.730
 all kinds dark in the field even priest 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.580
 the opponent his exclusive will be you have 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.660
 the fact that we have one 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.100
 great cool that sucks the most 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.020
 in production for this game will be 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.970
 pokemon activity on the net practically 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.590
 it will be a sort of accessible mini game 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.989
 at any time of the game e 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.340
 adaptable to the touch screen with the heart 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.020
 altogether three interact with the ato and scott 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.640
 of little moon to do so that we are 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.280
 victims of skill increase avoidance 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.260
 friendship and these things here 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.900
 other 8 municipalities that will also be inserted 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.670
 the sat or super virtual training 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.050
 those super workout rituals of 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.610
 points practice and up to 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.370
 other games have always been little 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.140
 hidden will be made public or you 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.459
 you can edit the statistics too 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.590
 with a up to exceed that of the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.110
 others in the mouth not of the same species 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.030
 up to a maximum level 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.769
 a free Pokémon xy are not the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.330
 my evolutions that occur through 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.680
 of the stones 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.140
 some examples of what little they were 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 nega wrists are mag a view to back out 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.090
 soul 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.769
 from ros indeed but if these types here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 megaproductions are temporary or e 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.389
 not only until the fight ends 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 the crap of the pokémon new and what not 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.150
 you can have more than a few that you do n't have 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.730
 wanted in the team during the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.829
 battle after the mergers the pokémon of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.450
 pulmonary white 2 as present scale 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.370
 you will close it black and white 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.319
 we have a reminder of the gimondi in 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.700
 this version of new pokémon ie 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.799
 for me the evolutions are always approaching 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.000
 more to the world of the damon but keep 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.489
 on the assumption that revolutions 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.349
 announced will be 22 more than most 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.980
 part will still have to be released 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.419
 in my humble opinion 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.010
 yes we can see a slight one 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.349
 detachment from the normal world of gods 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.019
 pokémon to a world we say future 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.430
 hypothetical for a mega corruption to be 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.590
 they are not just transformed 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.500
 during the fight it is very close pd 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.939
 to some kind of super sayan with this 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.699
 I don't want to say that my evolutions 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.709
 be the shit and I play though 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.060
 example as for me wireless to blake and it is 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.349
 was indeed announced a real one 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.849
 evolution I would have preferred one 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.430
 infectious evolution as for example 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.610
 for mag mark and for basic letter while 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.530
 instead youtuber awards 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.120
 legendary the friendly walls evolution 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.040
 only during the fight more than 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.450
 right otherwise the parameters would be 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.459
 too busted and struggles would be 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.290
 one thing too difficult for me 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.450
 opinion has been lost between this bobby game 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.850
 moore that others is kind of rivalry 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.430
 between species as always in the first games 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.200
 little but we had pinzi re saiter in the 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.480
 second generation will be yes 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.790
 will evolve engraved while then if it will remain 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.500
 at the first stage it was announced 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.810
 precisely a mega production of split is 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.190
 a mega production of pinzi and that is not 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.260
 there is more rivalry because it is 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.970
 most revolution free 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.590
 of my evolution has been announced 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.290
 precisely for the third little generation 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.870
 in fact we see ab solmi while I know 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.730
 etcetera etc. etc. precisely 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.770
 this mega evolution I would have 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.300
 preferred to be an actual evolution 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.820
 why like ver 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.740
 but malaria dead as electra ma 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.419
 we know how to activate I would have liked 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.680
 have a good evolution as well as the end 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.770
 the stadium returned to the fight 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.770
 initial 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.700
 in conclusion then I believe that 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.260
 I am not wanted young people in meda 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.090
 reality is not the only me the game 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.830
 billions of bot missing name made 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.490
 at least not until now then later 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.400
 know if count 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.440
 we hope if i will buy game for me that yes 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.410
 that complete it I will take a bit like y 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:30.040
 well i'm stupid knicks and what to think of 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.960
 pokemon hicks 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.850
 I will surely take this whatever it is 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.820
 been a shelter judging the choices 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.970
 that could be masked by 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.410
 so let's say if they could put 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.500
 be better managed all masked 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.220
 as of its dangerous omega evolutions 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.200
 that is right here as usual there 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.240
 are the links in the description parts 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.770
 so many see a shit you write me e 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.310
 half I like Sicilian power of 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.310
 power
