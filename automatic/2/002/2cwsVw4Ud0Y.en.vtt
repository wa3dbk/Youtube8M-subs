00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
this first technique is called say za my

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.940 
this first technique is called say za my
say<00:00:03.689> Z<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.170> traditional<00:00:04.710> seated

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
say Z is this traditional seated

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.889 
say Z is this traditional seated
position<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.730> in<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.180> with<00:00:06.540> my<00:00:06.690> knees

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
position that I'm in here with my knees

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.009 
position that I'm in here with my knees
with<00:00:07.500> my<00:00:07.680> legs<00:00:08.250> underneath<00:00:08.639> me<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.660> means

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.259 
with my legs underneath me and my means
forward<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.710> essentially<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:11.580> got<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.940> an

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
forward so essentially I've got a an

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.450 
forward so essentially I've got a an
opponent<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.139> front<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.559> perhaps

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
opponent right in front of me perhaps

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.689

negotiations have gone awry and I need
to<00:00:17.820> defend<00:00:18.539> myself<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:19.199> maybe<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> an

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to defend myself or maybe I have a an

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.929 
to defend myself or maybe I have a an
order<00:00:21.270> from<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.930> Lord<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:23.369> something<00:00:23.760> such

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
order from my Lord to do something such

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.970 
order from my Lord to do something such
as<00:00:23.970> move<00:00:24.570> forward<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> negotiations<00:00:25.680> maybe<00:00:25.890> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
as move forward in negotiations maybe a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.640 
as move forward in negotiations maybe a
little<00:00:26.189> bit<00:00:26.279> more<00:00:26.430> aggressively<00:00:27.500> first<00:00:28.500> I'll

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
little bit more aggressively first I'll

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
little bit more aggressively first I'll
demonstrate<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.369> I'll<00:00:29.490> walk

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
demonstrate it and then I'll walk

00:00:29.670 --> 00:01:02.110 
demonstrate it and then I'll walk
through<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.210> show<00:00:30.840> each<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> pieces

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.280
