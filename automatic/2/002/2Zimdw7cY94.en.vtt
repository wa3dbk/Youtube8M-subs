don't<00:03:05.840> want<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.380> because<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:06.890> one

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
don't want it to because of that one

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.570 
don't want it to because of that one
choice<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.300> made<00:03:08.510> you're<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:08.990> damn<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
choice you made you're like damn it I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.790 
choice you made you're like damn it I
didn't<00:03:11.210> want<00:03:11.240> it<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> go<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:11.900> way<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:12.650> it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
didn't want it to go this way and now it

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.680 
didn't want it to go this way and now it
is<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.190> there's<00:03:13.400> also<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.700> great<00:03:13.970> replay<00:03:14.450> value

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
is so there's also a great replay value

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.360 
is so there's also a great replay value
there<00:03:15.050> because<00:03:15.320> what<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> actually<00:03:15.800> beat<00:03:16.190> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
there because what I actually beat the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.340 
there because what I actually beat the
game<00:03:16.550> last<00:03:16.850> night<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.330> didn't<00:03:17.900> get<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.050> very<00:03:18.290> good

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
game last night I didn't get a very good

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.410 
game last night I didn't get a very good
ending<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.920> didn't<00:03:19.220> like<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.550> ending<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.390> I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
ending I didn't like the ending and so I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.330 
ending I didn't like the ending and so I
replayed<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.050> last<00:03:21.260> chapter<00:03:21.710> again<00:03:22.040> because

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
replayed the last chapter again because

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.190 
replayed the last chapter again because
I<00:03:22.370> had<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.730> option<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.240> do<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.450> from<00:03:23.960> the<00:03:24.050> main

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
I had the option to do so from the main

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.170 
I had the option to do so from the main
menu<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:25.040> got<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> much<00:03:25.460> better<00:03:25.730> ending

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
menu and I got a much better ending

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.000 
menu and I got a much better ending
because<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.450> knew<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.960> path<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.470> take<00:03:27.710> so<00:03:27.920> the

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
early part of this game and it really

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.600 
early part of this game and it really
started<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.620> get<00:04:30.740> under<00:04:30.919> my<00:04:30.949> skin<00:04:31.070> because

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
started to get under my skin because

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.070 
started to get under my skin because
that's<00:04:31.820> one<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.210> things<00:04:32.389> I<00:04:32.539> hate<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.930> most

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
that's one of the things I hate the most

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.560 
that's one of the things I hate the most
about<00:04:33.289> horror<00:04:33.710> movies<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:34.280> false<00:04:34.850> scares

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
about horror movies is false scares

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.300 
about horror movies is false scares
because<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.020> think<00:04:36.169> they're<00:04:36.470> weak<00:04:36.800> but<00:04:37.160> there

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
because I think they're weak but there

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.499 
because I think they're weak but there
came<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> point<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.090> game<00:04:38.270> when<00:04:38.479> I

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
came a point in this game when I

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.999 
came a point in this game when I
realized<00:04:38.930> I'm<00:04:39.080> pretty<00:04:39.320> sure<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.650> creators

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
realized I'm pretty sure the creators

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.200 
realized I'm pretty sure the creators
are<00:04:40.130> doing<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:40.490> on<00:04:40.669> purpose

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
are doing this on purpose

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.879 
are doing this on purpose
they<00:04:41.300> are<00:04:41.449> tributing<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> horror<00:04:42.199> genre<00:04:42.289> they

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
they are tributing the horror genre they

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.070 
they are tributing the horror genre they
are<00:04:43.009> recognizing<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:44.090> flaws<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.840> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
are recognizing the flaws and the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.320 
are recognizing the flaws and the
stupidity<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.740> certain<00:04:46.280> tropes<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:46.850> cliches

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
stupidity of certain tropes and cliches

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.210 
stupidity of certain tropes and cliches
within<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.020> horror<00:04:48.229> genre<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:48.889> think

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
within the horror genre and I think

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.680 
within the horror genre and I think
they're<00:04:49.430> acknowledging<00:04:50.030> all<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.539> and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
they're acknowledging all of that and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.689 
they're acknowledging all of that and
just<00:04:51.110> letting<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.590> happen<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.340> fun<00:04:52.550> with

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
just letting it happen and have fun with

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.370 
just letting it happen and have fun with
it<00:04:52.759> gratefully<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.419> game<00:04:53.570> picks<00:04:53.810> up<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.259> the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
it gratefully the game picks up in the

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.529 
it gratefully the game picks up in the
latter<00:04:54.590> half<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.160> scares<00:04:55.430> are<00:04:55.639> actually<00:04:56.000> real

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
latter half the scares are actually real

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.210 
latter half the scares are actually real
even<00:04:56.990> though<00:04:57.110> certain<00:04:57.500> things<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.889> happen

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
even though certain things that happen

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.860 
even though certain things that happen
in<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.460> story<00:04:58.789> don't<00:04:59.330> always<00:04:59.479> make<00:04:59.810> sense

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
in this story don't always make sense

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.140 
in this story don't always make sense
and<00:05:00.380> some<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:00.949> can<00:05:01.190> be<00:05:01.250> because<00:05:01.849> you<00:05:02.120> have

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
and some of that can be because you have

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.960 
and some of that can be because you have
control<00:05:02.990> over<00:05:03.349> the<00:05:03.830> way<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.130> story<00:05:04.400> plays<00:05:04.639> out

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
control over the way the story plays out

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.060 
control over the way the story plays out
so<00:05:05.300> sometimes<00:05:05.840> character<00:05:06.560> arcs<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:06.949> you

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
so sometimes character arcs that you

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.499 
so sometimes character arcs that you
were<00:05:07.190> expecting<00:05:07.759> don't<00:05:07.970> happen<00:05:08.360> because

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
were expecting don't happen because

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.240 
were expecting don't happen because
maybe<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:08.900> screw<00:05:09.229> up<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.620> character<00:05:10.039> dies

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
maybe you screw up and a character dies

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.339 
maybe you screw up and a character dies
or<00:05:10.610> something<00:05:10.639> or<00:05:11.090> certain<00:05:11.360> story<00:05:11.690> arcs<00:05:12.110> don't

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
or something or certain story arcs don't

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.510 
or something or certain story arcs don't
make<00:05:12.500> sense<00:05:12.710> or<00:05:12.979> things<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.430> were

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
make sense or things that you were

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.670 
make sense or things that you were
expecting<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:14.150> learn<00:05:14.300> more<00:05:14.599> about<00:05:14.660> are<00:05:15.169> never

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
expecting to learn more about are never

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.200 
expecting to learn more about are never
revealed<00:05:16.130> because<00:05:16.310> maybe<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.849> didn't<00:05:17.150> get

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
revealed because maybe you didn't get

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.730 
revealed because maybe you didn't get
the<00:05:17.360> perfect<00:05:17.690> ending<00:05:17.990> or<00:05:18.110> something<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.590> so

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
the perfect ending or something and so

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.260 
the perfect ending or something and so
sometimes<00:05:19.039> that<00:05:19.280> story<00:05:19.669> can<00:05:19.849> get<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.030> little

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
sometimes that story can get a little

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.490 
sometimes that story can get a little
annoying<00:05:20.539> unless<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.020> do<00:05:21.139> everything

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
annoying unless you do everything

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.439 
annoying unless you do everything
flawlessly<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.370> my<00:05:22.699> biggest<00:05:22.970> issue<00:05:23.300> with

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
flawlessly so my biggest issue with

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.540 
flawlessly so my biggest issue with
until<00:05:23.960> dawn<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.380> really<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.860> story<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.430> how

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
until dawn is really the story and how

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.490 
until dawn is really the story and how
it<00:05:25.699> plays<00:05:25.910> out<00:05:26.120> but<00:05:26.599> in<00:05:26.720> some<00:05:26.960> ways<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:27.320> also

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
it plays out but in some ways it's also

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.200 
it plays out but in some ways it's also
a<00:05:27.680> great<00:05:27.919> strength<00:05:28.430> because<00:05:28.820> one<00:05:29.060> of<00:05:29.150> my

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
a great strength because one of my

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.939 
a great strength because one of my
friends<00:05:29.539> was<00:05:29.659> just<00:05:29.810> over<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.139> other<00:05:30.260> day<00:05:30.349> he

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
friends was just over the other day he

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
was about to leave and he was like I'll

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.240 
was about to leave and he was like I'll
see<00:05:32.870> what<00:05:33.020> this<00:05:33.110> until<00:05:33.470> dawn<00:05:33.710> game<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.070> like

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
see what this until dawn game is like

see what this until dawn game is like
and<00:05:34.400> he<00:05:34.490> ended<00:05:34.639> up<00:05:34.729> watching<00:05:35.150> me<00:05:35.240> play<00:05:35.479> it<00:05:35.630> for

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
and he ended up watching me play it for

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.450 
and he ended up watching me play it for
like<00:05:35.870> two<00:05:36.050> hours<00:05:36.080> because<00:05:36.680> he<00:05:36.800> got<00:05:36.949> into<00:05:37.340> the

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
like two hours because he got into the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.339 
like two hours because he got into the
story<00:05:37.729> and<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.300> almost<00:05:38.599> made<00:05:38.840> him<00:05:38.930> want<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.199> buy

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
story and it almost made him want to buy

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.560 
story and it almost made him want to buy
a<00:05:39.380> ps4<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.430> is<00:05:40.639> definitely<00:05:40.970> a

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
a ps4 so that is definitely a

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.480 
a ps4 so that is definitely a
praiseworthy<00:05:42.229> element<00:05:42.889> of<00:05:42.949> until<00:05:43.280> dawn

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
praiseworthy element of until dawn

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.070 
praiseworthy element of until dawn
despite<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.090> fact<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:44.360> some<00:05:44.479> of<00:05:44.870> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
despite the fact that some of the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.839 
despite the fact that some of the
elements<00:05:45.409> of<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.770> story<00:05:46.010> are<00:05:46.220> also<00:05:46.580> its

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
elements of the story are also its

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.060 
elements of the story are also its
weakest<00:05:47.419> points<00:05:47.810> I'm<00:05:47.990> going<00:05:48.260> to<00:05:48.349> give<00:05:48.470> until

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
weakest points I'm going to give until

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.899 
weakest points I'm going to give until
dawn<00:05:49.340> and<00:05:49.370> eight<00:05:50.000> point<00:05:50.479> five<00:05:50.780> out<00:05:51.229> of<00:05:51.289> ten

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
dawn and eight point five out of ten

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.219
