should be posting all the videos and
evening<00:02:48.070> sometimes<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:48.970> go<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> school

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
evening sometimes so if you go to school

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
evening sometimes so if you go to school
still<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.020> can<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.320> come<00:02:50.440> home<00:02:50.500> after

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
still you can just come home after

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.170 
still you can just come home after
school<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.370> hopefully<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> video<00:02:51.940> will<00:02:52.090> be

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
school and hopefully the video will be

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.500 
school and hopefully the video will be
up<00:02:52.330> by<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.530> 54<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.190> believe<00:02:54.610> 54<00:02:55.390> is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
up by then so it's 54 I believe 54 is

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
up by then so it's 54 I believe 54 is
the<00:02:55.660> page<00:02:55.870> number<00:02:56.230> will<00:02:57.070> count<00:02:57.310> how<00:02:57.520> many<00:02:58.530> one

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the page number will count how many one

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.370 
the page number will count how many one
two<00:03:00.160> three<00:03:00.190> four<00:03:00.760> five<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.840> twenty<00:03:02.170> percent

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
two three four five so a twenty percent

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.810 
two three four five so a twenty percent
chance<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.890> winning<00:03:03.160> if<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.370> on<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.610> page

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
chance of winning if you're on that page

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.630 
chance of winning if you're on that page
1<00:03:04.660> through<00:03:04.900> 5<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.950> will<00:03:06.190> make<00:03:06.370> sure<00:03:06.430> that
