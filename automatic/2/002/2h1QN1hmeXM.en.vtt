 already available for xbox 3 60 and soon for ps3 the darkness is a fps 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.320
 based on the homonymous unknown American comic seeds 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.949
 published to be touched 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.009
 the geekiest hot protagonist 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.570
 ends in spite of himself on a collision course with lazio poli franchetti 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.640
 crazy mafia boss vito the american will be unleashed against a war without 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 exclusion of strikes uncle poles I can not verify that possessed by the window 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.310
 a very powerful demon 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.670
 it feeds on the darkness of the north 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.080
 and will make you the life of all the protagonists 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.570
 a real child 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.940
 the dark mestre featured by a temple italy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 via - data 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.200
 with some element of puzzle solving is an exciting story 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.170
 whose performance is rich in twists and turns 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110
 apart from the use of various types of weapons 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.500
 jerk able to exploit certain powers 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.770
 for example, it will be possible to recall the data 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.360
 demons of the earth 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.080
 although fun to use this is an elegant marginal role 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 you want them for their weakness in sale does not dissolve them in a few seconds you want 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 for very limited artificial intelligence 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.540
 the darwins are 4t 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.810
 the berseker 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.120
 a sadistic demon who tries to sew any living being 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.190
 the kamikaze 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.260
 explodes on contact for 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.110
 the gunslinger armed with a heavy machine gun great for creating a fire of 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.810
 cover and finally i liked her teacher that destroys light sources the way 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 to create the perfect darkness 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 the demonic powers are much more important for nintendo 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.890
 a sort of spells that allow you to interact with the environment in a way 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 particular 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090
 initially get a few options available 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.410
 I could call creeping darkness 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.869
 a creature able to move in the tunnels to climb the walls 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.869
 circumvent any obstacle kevin credir behind 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.440
 under player control 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.119
 as the heart devours the ends of your fines 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.319
 the level of darkness will increase by developing new powers 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.729
 increasing the strength of the strokes of win and the corrosive action of light 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.510
 the second goalkeeper you will get 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 is that of the tentacle of darkness the most versatile and amusing say 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.189
 genchi 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.149
 is able to seek to destroy light sources 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.779
 to attack with devastating force and above all to move to move one 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.489
 large amount of people 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.429
 from the final tables very heavy police cars 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.189
 allowing you to play creatively with the environment 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.539
 taking advantage of excellent physical engine 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.309
 the third power provides two weapons not particularly effective 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.029
 power 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.269
 beta ark seen 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.859
 and is somewhat more influential in the economy 18 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.859
 fineco you will have the possibility to recall the peak 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.940
 these will not be the light sources 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.310
 but above all the enemies that are close enough will all die 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.309
 few moments 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.689
 this could make a basket of treasures 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.159
 the risk is to use 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.819
 solve most complicated situations 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.309
 yes that rents if slightly game play and game variety 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.029
 the management of the camera movements is particular above all 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.189
 in the first hours of the game you will have the feeling of an inaccurate system 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.539
 the controls are fortunately highly customizable 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.219
 increasing the acceleration parameters on the axes x edition and possibly 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.319
 2 with effectiveness of my automatic 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.729
 the experience becomes more engaging 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.189
 the fact remains that the system will tell you as well as the collision between nietzsche 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.179
 strokes are decidedly inaccurate, especially with cultured weapons 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.429
 it will often happen that even at close range 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.749
 you will have to shoot more than once to see the color reactions in the 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.059
 victim 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.979
 artificial intelligence also poorly treated 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.540
 opponents are generally not very reactive, almost always immobile 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.869
 waiting to shoot you to be killed 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.059
 unable to escape react if not in a completely random way who I am at 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.429
 higher difficulty level 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:04:00.429
 the technical and touch realization of current videogame productions 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:04.619
 a 3d engine is a visual impact that can easily rival 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.539
 with the maximum weight of the category 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.799
 virzo wants 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.599
 quality surface shader texture rarely seen before 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.979
 excellent implementation of the blog moschel 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.840
 volumetric particle effects of first 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.070
 and finally an amazing lighting system, new point of reference 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.840
 of the category 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.099
 soon the play of light and shadow is an integral part of the belly 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.949
 good fluidity generally around 30 fps even with dogs 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.270
 more agitated situations 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.340
 which can make it a bit complicated to take v 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.569
 Physical engine is one of the fine pieces of the dark waters 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.289
 reason for amazement continuous fun 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.059
 the artistic component is decidedly incidental 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.479
 and the quality level is very high 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.240
 another piece in what a real videogame renaissance among 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.139
 European and American developers the real weak point of the latest effort 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.870
 sparanise and the ups and downs of manga characters 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.460
 the system that manages the joints and their animation without too many laps 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.360
 of words 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.659
 emotions are bad 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.849
 different speech for the models of the protagonists during the cocks 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.789
 excellent July, rich in Italy, but sometimes not very expressive because of 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.330
 quite simple facial animations 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.919
 animations during intermission scenes are generally taken care of 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.449
 bari is inspired although of swing quality almost perfect sequences 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.139
 and others of low level 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.770
 it almost always gives jerking simply perfect in his 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.740
 performance alone in the dark a fun and engaging acting i 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.780
 masters born 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.540
 all based on the stereotype of you the American in kg to express himself better 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.110
 if it is not blatantly gesticulating, the downside is very little 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.510
 expressive though be modeled by the design outside the classical schemes 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.879
 no less important than the golden section 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.490
 characterized by 8 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.809
 db2 the soundtrack of this molina 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.479
 able to dynamically highlight the most exciting violent moments 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.330
 romantics 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.340
 rich in pieces and PCs and cinematic taste 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.889
 the dark messiah even if far from being a perfect game e 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.589
 probably the best title next genesis of this first half of 2007 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.589
 history oriented towards a decidedly public. 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.550
 on some occasions he will leave you speechless and manage to excite me 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.539
 chandeliers disoriented traits with furious features 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.490
 the characters are well characterized clear of well-kept entertaining clubs 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.770
 very violent in their vulgarity 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.449
 i do is acting in English is of a high standard as well as the care of 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.550
 Italian translation not offered by any kind of censorship 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.139
 some may turn up their noses at a longevity that settles 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.479
 around 10 hours 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.729
 maltitolo lends itself to being replayed 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.270
 offering a good level of bad luck technically and artistically 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.860
 very high quality although not without flaws 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.559
 the best quality of the darkness the game play 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.059
 very varied amusing 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.129
 full of touches of innovation class 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.580
 slightly undermined by an inaccurate control system 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.520
 the darkness 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.210
 is a must-have for xbox 3 60 and ps3 owners
