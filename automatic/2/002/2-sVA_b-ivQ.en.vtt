the sandwich Eliza so the science behind
analyze<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.300> actually<00:00:45.750> relatively<00:00:46.200> simple<00:00:46.469> so

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
analyze is actually relatively simple so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
analyze is actually relatively simple so
let's<00:00:47.340> suppose<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:48.030> working<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.420> a

medical laboratory and we get a shipment
of<00:00:50.940> serum<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.079> HIV<00:00:52.469> patient<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
of serum from an HIV patient and this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
of serum from an HIV patient and this
person's<00:00:54.210> doctor<00:00:54.660> wants<00:00:54.960> us<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> determine

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
person's doctor wants us to determine

the concentration of HIV protein in this
patients<00:00:58.859> blood<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.640> determine<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
patients blood to determine the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.599 
patients blood to determine the
effectiveness<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.930> his<00:01:01.260> treatment<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> do

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
effectiveness of his treatment so to do

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.759 
effectiveness of his treatment so to do
this<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.270> start<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.750> by<00:01:04.260> obtaining<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
this we would start off by obtaining a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
this we would start off by obtaining a
96-well<00:01:05.519> plate<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.750> look<00:01:06.840> something

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
96-well plate that would look something

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.600 
96-well plate that would look something
like<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.400> plate

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
like this and this is actually the plate

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
like this and this is actually the plate
for<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.119> Eliza<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> make<00:01:10.409> things

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
for my first Eliza so the make things

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200 
for my first Eliza so the make things
look<00:01:10.770> easier<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> give<00:01:11.640> us<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.909> view

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
look easier I'm going to give us a view

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
look easier I'm going to give us a view
of<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> wells<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> plate<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of one of the wells in the plate so here

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
of one of the wells in the plate so here
we're<00:01:14.729> looking<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> single<00:01:15.450> whale<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
we're looking at a single whale and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
we're looking at a single whale and
we're<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> start<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:17.280> having<00:01:17.700> an

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
we're going to start off by having an

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.210 
we're going to start off by having an
antibody<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.840> specific<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> HIV

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
antibody that is specific to the HIV

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700 
antibody that is specific to the HIV
antigen<00:01:20.640> plating<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> whale<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> played

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
antigen plating the whale so it played

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
antigen plating the whale so it played
the<00:01:22.740> well<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.750> take

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the well with that and then we take

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.130 
the well with that and then we take
serum<00:01:25.560> from<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.100> patient<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.820> put<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
serum from this patient and put the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.609 
serum from this patient and put the
serum<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.400> whale<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.840> antigen<00:01:31.470> or

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
serum over the whale then the antigen or

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
serum over the whale then the antigen or
HIV<00:01:32.100> protein<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:33.210> bind<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> antibody<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
HIV protein will bind to the antibody so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
HIV protein will bind to the antibody so
the<00:01:35.460> term<00:01:36.030> based<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> level<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.079> protein

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the term based on the level of protein

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460 
the term based on the level of protein
if<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.369> patient<00:01:38.909> has<00:01:39.150> high<00:01:39.509> levels<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> HIV

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
if this patient has high levels of HIV

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
if this patient has high levels of HIV
antigen<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.790> antigen<00:01:42.210> will<00:01:42.329> bind<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
antigen a lot of antigen will bind to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899 
antigen a lot of antigen will bind to
the<00:01:42.720> antibodies<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.860> person<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.310> low

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the antibodies if this person has low

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
the antibodies if this person has low
levels<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> HIV<00:01:45.720> antigen<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
levels of HIV antigen not a lot of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
levels of HIV antigen not a lot of
antigen<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.640> bind<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> these<00:01:47.970> proteins<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
antigen will bind to these proteins and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
antigen will bind to these proteins and
that's<00:01:49.049> indicative<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> concentration<00:01:50.430> but

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that's indicative of a concentration but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
that's indicative of a concentration but
we<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> yet<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.250> want<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
we don't know that yet so if we want to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
we don't know that yet so if we want to
determine<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> amount<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> antibody<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
determine the amount of antibody that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
determine the amount of antibody that
bound<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.820> amount<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> antigen<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> bound

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
bound the amount of antigen that bound

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
bound the amount of antigen that bound
to<00:01:57.930> those<00:01:58.049> antibodies<00:01:58.500> we're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> need

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
to those antibodies we're going to need

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.789 
to those antibodies we're going to need
another<00:01:59.579> antibody<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> antibody<00:02:01.530> will

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
another antibody so that antibody will

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
another antibody so that antibody will
then<00:02:01.920> bind<00:02:02.189> against<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> antigen<00:02:03.450> but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
then bind against the antigen but

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
then bind against the antigen but
something<00:02:04.110> will<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.350> different<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.890> this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
something will be different about this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
something will be different about this
antibody<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:06.149> antibody<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
antibody this antibody will have a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.650 
antibody this antibody will have a
flashlight<00:02:07.799> attached<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.179> flashlight

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
flashlight attached to it the flashlight

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.100 
flashlight attached to it the flashlight
is<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.170> enzyme<00:02:10.619> or

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
is really an enzyme or

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.170 
is really an enzyme or
or<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.320> biotin<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.370> we'll<00:02:12.640> talk<00:02:12.820> about<00:02:12.940> that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
or in biotin but we'll talk about that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.620 
or in biotin but we'll talk about that
as<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.420> move<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:15.160> secondary<00:02:15.970> antibody

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
as we move on so this secondary antibody

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
as we move on so this secondary antibody
is<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:19.390> over<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> well<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.530> will

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
is then put over the well and it will

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.100 
is then put over the well and it will
bind<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> antigen<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.940> bound<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
bind to the antigen that is bound to the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.380 
bind to the antigen that is bound to the
capture<00:02:23.560> antibody<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> first<00:02:24.880> antibody

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
capture antibody or the first antibody

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 
capture antibody or the first antibody
that<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.660> put<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.680> once<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.460> bound<00:02:27.880> to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that we put in so once it is bound to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.530 
that we put in so once it is bound to
the<00:02:28.890> antigen<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> color<00:02:31.300> metric

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
the antigen we now have a color metric

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.360 
the antigen we now have a color metric
reading<00:02:32.020> because<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> flashlight<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.040> giving

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
reading because the flashlight is giving

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.340 
reading because the flashlight is giving
off<00:02:33.520> light<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.020> put<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.290> our

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
off light that we can put in our

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.840 
off light that we can put in our
spectrophotometer<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.370> determine<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
spectrophotometer to determine the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.730 
spectrophotometer to determine the
intensity<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.600> light<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.350> if<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.590> have<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
intensity of that light so if we have a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.840 
intensity of that light so if we have a
high<00:02:39.010> intensity<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:40.890> light<00:02:41.890> being<00:02:42.190> put<00:02:42.430> off<00:02:42.550> by

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
high intensity of light being put off by

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.840 
high intensity of light being put off by
the<00:02:43.290> secondary<00:02:44.290> antibody<00:02:44.620> we'll<00:02:45.459> know<00:02:45.640> that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
the secondary antibody we'll know that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.400 
the secondary antibody we'll know that
that<00:02:46.090> meant<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.510> lot<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.900> antigen

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
that meant that a lot of antigen

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
that meant that a lot of antigen
initially<00:02:47.920> bound<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.610> capture<00:02:49.000> antibody

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
initially bound to the capture antibody

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.510 
initially bound to the capture antibody
and<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.350> person<00:02:50.739> has<00:02:50.860> high<00:02:51.040> levels<00:02:51.430> of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and that this person has high levels of

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.000 
and that this person has high levels of
HIV<00:02:51.820> protein<00:02:52.420> if<00:02:52.570> there's<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.140> low<00:02:53.410> level<00:02:53.650> of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
HIV protein if there's a low level of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.130 
HIV protein if there's a low level of
luminescent<00:02:54.760> intensity<00:02:55.270> then<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.900> means

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
luminescent intensity then that means

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.070 
luminescent intensity then that means
that<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.500> person<00:02:56.739> had<00:02:57.070> low<00:02:57.250> levels<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:58.080> HIV

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
that this person had low levels of HIV

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.350 
that this person had low levels of HIV
antigen<00:02:59.560> because<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> lot<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.760> antigen

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
antigen because not a lot of antigen

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.120 
antigen because not a lot of antigen
initially<00:03:01.750> bound<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> capture<00:03:02.590> handle<00:03:03.010> on

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
initially bound to the capture handle on

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.940 
initially bound to the capture handle on
e<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.459> that's<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.540> basic<00:03:04.930> science<00:03:05.320> behind<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
e so that's the basic science behind a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.890 
e so that's the basic science behind a
sandwich<00:03:06.610> iliza<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.480> why<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:07.750> called

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
sandwich iliza that is why it's called

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.020 
sandwich iliza that is why it's called
the<00:03:08.020> sandwich<00:03:08.470> iliza<00:03:08.739> because<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.760> a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the sandwich iliza because you have a

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.420 
the sandwich iliza because you have a
antigen<00:03:11.020> sandwiched<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.770> between<00:03:11.830> two

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
antigen sandwiched in between two

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.460 
antigen sandwiched in between two
antibodies<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.630> lot<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.930> times<00:03:14.140> you'll

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
antibodies and a lot of times you'll

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.690 
antibodies and a lot of times you'll
actually<00:03:14.590> find<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.220> have<00:03:15.340> more<00:03:15.549> than

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
actually find that you have more than

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.640 
actually find that you have more than
two<00:03:15.850> antibodies<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> secondary

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
two antibodies and that the secondary

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.320 
two antibodies and that the secondary
antibody<00:03:18.040> doesn't<00:03:18.610> actually<00:03:18.730> have<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
antibody doesn't actually have the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.970 
antibody doesn't actually have the
flashlight<00:03:19.840> attached<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.620> that's

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
flashlight attached to it and that's

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.440 
flashlight attached to it and that's
because<00:03:21.220> it's<00:03:21.370> very<00:03:21.430> expensive<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.299> make

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
because it's very expensive to make

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.720 
because it's very expensive to make
antibodies<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.230> specific<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.980> your

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
antibodies that are specific to your

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.360 
antibodies that are specific to your
antigen<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.780> also<00:03:25.930> have<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.440> conjugate

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
antigen and that also have a conjugate

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.670 
antigen and that also have a conjugate
enzyme<00:03:27.790> or<00:03:27.970> flashlight<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.380> case

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
enzyme or flashlight so in this case

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.840 
enzyme or flashlight so in this case
what<00:03:29.890> you'll<00:03:30.010> have<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.160> you'll<00:03:30.430> still<00:03:30.640> have<00:03:30.730> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
what you'll have is you'll still have a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.340 
what you'll have is you'll still have a
secondary<00:03:31.299> that<00:03:31.510> will<00:03:31.630> bind<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.200> antigen

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
secondary that will bind to the antigen

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.289 
secondary that will bind to the antigen
however<00:03:33.280> will<00:03:33.610> not<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> flashlight

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
however will not have a flashlight

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.150 
however will not have a flashlight
attached<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.110> you'll<00:03:35.440> actually<00:03:35.560> then<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.130> a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
attached and you'll actually then have a

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.270 
attached and you'll actually then have a
third<00:03:36.910> antibody<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:38.380> has<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.860> flashlight

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
third antibody which has the flashlight

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.699 
third antibody which has the flashlight
attached<00:03:39.610> but<00:03:40.090> instead<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.540> binding<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.170> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
attached but instead of binding to the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.090 
attached but instead of binding to the
antigen<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.580> will<00:03:42.970> bind<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.019> FC<00:03:44.170> receptor

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
antigen it will bind to the FC receptor

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.280 
antigen it will bind to the FC receptor
of<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.640> secondary<00:03:46.180> antibody<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.170> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
of the secondary antibody and this is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.620 
of the secondary antibody and this is
much<00:03:47.470> cheaper<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.860> make<00:03:48.130> another<00:03:48.970> alternative

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
much cheaper to make another alternative

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.229 
much cheaper to make another alternative
is<00:03:49.780> using<00:03:50.470> biotin<00:03:51.040> lated<00:03:51.400> antibodies<00:03:52.090> in

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
is using biotin lated antibodies in

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.660 
is using biotin lated antibodies in
which<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.900> secondary<00:03:53.410> antibody<00:03:53.769> can<00:03:54.489> either

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
which the secondary antibody can either

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.210 
which the secondary antibody can either
be<00:03:54.940> specific<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:55.540> nonspecific<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.860> which<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
be specific or nonspecific in which the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.190 
be specific or nonspecific in which the
secondary<00:03:57.670> antibody<00:03:58.000> rather<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:59.080> the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
secondary antibody rather have the

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.960 
secondary antibody rather have the
biotin<00:03:59.650> or<00:03:59.860> you'll<00:03:59.980> have<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.130> third<00:04:00.519> antibody

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
biotin or you'll have a third antibody

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.370 
biotin or you'll have a third antibody
they'll<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.360> pouch<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.750> but<00:04:02.230> you'll

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
they'll have the pouch in but you'll

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.759 
they'll have the pouch in but you'll
have<00:04:02.560> biotin<00:04:03.130> attached<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.549> an<00:04:03.640> antibody<00:04:04.060> and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
have biotin attached to an antibody and

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.470 
have biotin attached to an antibody and
then<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.489> biotin<00:04:07.000> which<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.239> attached<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
then this biotin which is attached to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.390 
then this biotin which is attached to
the<00:04:07.660> FC<00:04:07.959> receptor<00:04:08.440> will<00:04:08.860> then<00:04:09.040> come<00:04:09.280> in

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
the FC receptor will then come in

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.430 
the FC receptor will then come in
contact<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:10.269> an<00:04:10.420> avidin<00:04:10.900> streptavidin

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
contact with an avidin streptavidin

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.949 
contact with an avidin streptavidin
streptavidin<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:13.000> example<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.570> that

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
streptavidin for example and that

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.199 
streptavidin for example and that
produces<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.440> very<00:04:14.739> tight<00:04:15.519> high<00:04:15.850> affinity

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
produces a very tight high affinity

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.219 
produces a very tight high affinity
bonding<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:19.390> ensures<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.200> have

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
bonding so that ensures that you have

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.560 
bonding so that ensures that you have
bonding<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.190> biotin<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.300> you're

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
bonding to the biotin and you're

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.770 
bonding to the biotin and you're
releasing<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.140> column<00:04:23.380> matrix

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
releasing a column matrix

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.260 
releasing a column matrix
that<00:04:23.990> way<00:04:24.200> so<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:25.070> next<00:04:25.610> week's<00:04:25.790> video<00:04:26.060> we're

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
that way so in next week's video we're

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.610 
that way so in next week's video we're
going<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.510> go<00:04:26.720> into<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> lab<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:27.260> we're

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
going to go into the lab and we're

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.200 
going to go into the lab and we're
actually<00:04:27.740> going<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.130> do<00:04:28.400> analyze<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.120> we

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
actually going to do analyze it so we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.430 
actually going to do analyze it so we
can<00:04:29.330> learn<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.510> little<00:04:29.810> bit<00:04:29.870> more<00:04:30.110> about<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
can learn a little bit more about the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.100 
can learn a little bit more about the
hands<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:30.950> wet<00:04:31.639> activities<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.510> analyze<00:04:32.840> it's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
hands on wet activities of analyze it's

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.600 
hands on wet activities of analyze it's
as<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.500> wet<00:04:33.889> lab<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.850> also<00:04:35.750> since<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
as it is a wet lab so also since the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.270 
as it is a wet lab so also since the
holiday<00:04:37.610> season<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.300> approaching<00:04:38.750> us<00:04:39.169> we<00:04:40.070> have

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
holiday season is approaching us we have

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.680 
holiday season is approaching us we have
some<00:04:40.520> Christmas<00:04:41.200> holiday<00:04:42.200> themed<00:04:43.690> videos
