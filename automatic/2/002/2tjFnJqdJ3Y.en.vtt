all<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.979> helping<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.490> do<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:39.850> recoil<00:01:40.830> as<00:01:41.830> I

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
all that helping you do with recoil as I

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.030 
all that helping you do with recoil as I
remember<00:01:42.310> when<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.549> was<00:01:42.880> new<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.210> cod<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:44.770> got

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
remember when I was new to cod first got

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.880 
remember when I was new to cod first got
really<00:01:45.640> into<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.909> back<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.930> black<00:01:47.049> but<00:01:47.259> mondays

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
really into it back in black but mondays

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
really into it back in black but mondays
and<00:01:48.220> recall<00:01:48.820> on<00:01:48.909> those<00:01:49.119> guns<00:01:49.420> pretty<00:01:50.320> extreme

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
getting back to what I was going to say

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.179 
getting back to what I was going to say
great<00:01:54.970> way<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.150> dealing<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.540> three<00:01:55.840> poles

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
great way of dealing with three poles

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.210 
great way of dealing with three poles

so<00:02:28.570> teaching<00:02:30.540> strafing<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.720> when<00:02:31.870> you're

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
so teaching strafing is when you're

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.140 
so teaching strafing is when you're
aiming<00:02:32.380> down<00:02:32.560> site<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.400> tilt<00:02:33.760> your<00:02:33.820> left

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
aiming down site and you tilt your left

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.810 
aiming down site and you tilt your left
analog<00:02:34.870> stick<00:02:34.900> left<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.680> right<00:02:35.920> leave<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.430> so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
analog stick left to right leave that so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.600 
analog stick left to right leave that so
you're<00:02:36.970> moving<00:02:37.090> only<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.989> couple<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.980> steps<00:02:39.280> I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you're moving only a couple of steps I

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.690 
you're moving only a couple of steps I
decide<00:02:40.000> what<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.170> does<00:02:41.410> firstly<00:02:42.130> throws<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
decide what this does firstly throws the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.060 
decide what this does firstly throws the
enemy<00:02:43.000> off<00:02:43.120> targets<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.020> said<00:02:44.290> I'll<00:02:44.830> really
