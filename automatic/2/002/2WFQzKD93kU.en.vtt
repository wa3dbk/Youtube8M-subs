00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello how about youtube friends the day of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.069
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to put 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.099
 codes in the my boy emulator for 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.119
 android in this case in the game or in the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.930
 room pokemon red fire ok 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.220
 good 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.260
 What we are going to do is open our 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 emulator 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.360
 if you have the print version and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.770
 some reasons I'm going to let you do 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.840
 this 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.550
 this kind of steps to follow then 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.200
 here below I will leave you in the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.860
 inscription 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.890
 the full version the one that I have 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.840
 I do not know if with the free version go to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.540
 have problems but if there are any 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.810
 risk you can download the 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.670
 version was out if you 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.210
 they want to uninstall the version 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.910
 previous 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 the game is not going to affect anything in the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 game you will be able to continue to follow 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.550
 with their games already saved ok good 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.190
 what we are going to do is in this case 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.560
 put a code that allows us to be able to 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.330
 launch master balls within the zone 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 save and to be able to catch the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.030
 different pokemon that are rare 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.610
 find there as chance and zÃ¡iter 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.780
 cangas here or tauros ok good 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.540
 first we are going to open our 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.360
 emulator 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.000
 let's open our game room 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.620
 in my case as I told you, red pokemon 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 fire 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.840
 [Music] 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.390
 I had previously saved 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.219
 he had already saved me before entering 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.340
 to the safari area so that you can 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.490
 see how I'm going to install the code how 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 I'm going to put it ok ok what first 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.890
 Let's do is give 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.720
 Well, let's press the options button 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.820
 from our phone 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.850
 once we open this menu we go 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.070
 to click here does not say sheets as you see 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 me and here I already have 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.160
 the cheetah previously put but what 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.250
 I'll delete to see how how 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.720
 works ok let's give here where it says 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.370
 new city 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.180
 where it says that sidney 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.990
 we can change the name 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.080
 can put the one we want 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.470
 let's put him in this case 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.900
 master ball accept 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.600
 here a chic type says here we are going to 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.310
 leave a car where text says 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.250
 chip cod and this is where we're going to type 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 the code in this case if you what 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.680
 they want to put at once in their 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.780
 cell phones 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.159
 the code is the following of any 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.739
 way in the description of the video I 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.560
 I will leave this code and more codes that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.510
 I found myself in the post in which I 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.189
 I found this one that served me well 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 help ok 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:04.080
 well let's type the code of 82 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.080
 two 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.110
 letters d 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.069
 68 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.019
 three zeros and one 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.060
 let's go back accept back 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.180
 again and automatically we had 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.530
 that have marked 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.100
 our code let's go back and 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.270
 now we are going to verify what 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.270
 that if it works 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.879
 well once here 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.490
 let's find some pokemon so that 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.170
 see if this serves 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.410
 this trick we got a king juan 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.090
 let's give him a bowl and as you can see 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.459
 a master ball instead of the sam farr 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.610
 just like they normally give us and 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.890
 evidently 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.760
 the ruling is null because the master 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.760
 bold catches everything 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.120
 and well then well you can do 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.190
 to catch the pokemons that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.040
 what are the most difficult within this 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.829
 zone and in the same way when you 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.019
 leave this area you can 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.500
 catch any pokemon since if 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.750
 you are open in one because bolt one 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.550
 ultra ball a super bowl will follow them 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.080
 looking like a master burn 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.520
 then there will be no problem to catch 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.889
 to the legendary pokemones or the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.350
 pokemones you want ok good 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.350
 this has been everything I hope it serves them 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.990
