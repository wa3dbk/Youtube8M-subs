00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
instruction manual for this so here are

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
instruction manual for this so here are
all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.720> parts<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.350> Sol<00:01:10.650> blaze<00:01:10.950> let's<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
all the parts to Sol blaze let's take a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.960 
all the parts to Sol blaze let's take a
look<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.659> face<00:01:12.930> bolt<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.400> blaze

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
look at the face bolt which is blaze

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
look at the face bolt which is blaze
this<00:01:15.810> represents<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> Sun<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.369> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this represents the Sun as you can see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.620 
this represents the Sun as you can see
obviously<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:19.070> designed<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> Sun<00:01:20.729> kind

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
obviously it's designed like a Sun kind

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
obviously it's designed like a Sun kind
of<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> vortex<00:01:22.640> design<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> middle

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
of like a vortex design in the middle

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
of like a vortex design in the middle
and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:25.799> intentional

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and I don't know if this was intentional

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.929 
and I don't know if this was intentional
but<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.520> has<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.909> s's<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.470> sides<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.130> each

know that that was intentional or just
part<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> design<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.159> overall<00:01:35.850> pretty

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
part of the design but overall pretty

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.020 
part of the design but overall pretty

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.390 
honestly I like the gold version but I
think<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.140> stickers<00:02:31.530> would<00:02:31.770> look<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.130> lot

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
think the stickers would look a lot

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.580 
think the stickers would look a lot
better<00:02:32.460> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.390> regular<00:02:33.810> red<00:02:34.140> metallic

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
better on the regular red metallic

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.280 
better on the regular red metallic
version<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.210> golden<00:02:36.540> metallic

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
version so this is the golden metallic

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.250 
version so this is the golden metallic
version<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.860> Sol<00:02:38.130> blaze<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.750> like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
version of Sol blaze there are like

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
version of Sol blaze there are like
three<00:02:40.560> different<00:02:40.680> sections<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.670> four

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
three different sections or four

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.320 
three different sections or four
different<00:02:42.090> sections<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.200> beyblade<00:02:44.330> one

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
different sections of this beyblade one

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.810 
different sections of this beyblade one
two<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.930> there's<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.530> three<00:02:46.980> three

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
two three so there's of three three

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.790 
two three so there's of three three
blades<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> side<00:02:48.720> three<00:02:49.410> blades<00:02:49.620> right

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
blades on the side three blades right

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.460 
blades on the side three blades right
here<00:02:50.130> three<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.880> three<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.330> total<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.260> four

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
here three and three so total of four

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920 
here three and three so total of four
different<00:02:52.650> sections<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.210> total<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
different sections with the total of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.230 
different sections with the total of
twelve<00:02:55.530> blades<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.460> if<00:02:56.670> you're<00:02:56.820> wondering

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
twelve blades and if you're wondering

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.390 
twelve blades and if you're wondering
the<00:02:57.390> paint<00:02:57.630> will<00:02:57.930> chip<00:02:58.230> off<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.620> lot<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.890> painted

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the paint will chip off a lot of painted

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.990 
the paint will chip off a lot of painted
beyblades<00:02:59.940> will<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:01.560> chipped<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.820> do

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
beyblades will get chipped if you do

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390 
beyblades will get chipped if you do
battle<00:03:03.300> with<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.630> there<00:03:04.380> are<00:03:04.410> some<00:03:04.980> methods

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
battle with them there are some methods

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.640 
battle with them there are some methods
of<00:03:05.580> preserving<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.780> paint<00:03:07.020> but<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.530> know

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
of preserving the paint but I don't know

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
of preserving the paint but I don't know
how<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.070> some<00:03:08.430> people<00:03:08.700> use<00:03:09.000> nail<00:03:09.210> polish

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
how I think some people use nail polish

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
how I think some people use nail polish
like<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> clear<00:03:10.230> nail<00:03:10.440> polish<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.130> really

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
like a clear nail polish for it really

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.060 
like a clear nail polish for it really
cool<00:03:12.030> looking<00:03:12.390> metal<00:03:12.690> wheel<00:03:12.870> kind<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:13.800> has<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
cool looking metal wheel kind of has the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.490 
cool looking metal wheel kind of has the
same<00:03:14.100> design<00:03:14.610> as<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.910> clear<00:03:15.390> wheel<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.290> with

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
same design as the clear wheel like with

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.190 
same design as the clear wheel like with
the<00:03:16.820> rounded<00:03:17.820> solar<00:03:18.770> design<00:03:19.770> on<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:21.200> really

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
the rounded solar design on it really

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.670 
the rounded solar design on it really
nice<00:03:22.380> looking<00:03:22.709> beyblade<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.880> spin<00:03:27.120> track

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
nice looking beyblade and the spin track

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.060 
nice looking beyblade and the spin track
variable<00:03:28.680> 145<00:03:29.640> V<00:03:30.420> 145<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:31.740> are<00:03:31.860> two

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
variable 145 V 145 there are two

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.670 
variable 145 V 145 there are two
different<00:03:32.400> modes<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.150> there<00:03:34.020> is<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> tack

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
different modes to this there is a tack

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.910 
different modes to this there is a tack
mode<00:03:34.920> which<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.970> right<00:03:36.270> now<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.830> with<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
mode which is this right now so with the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.830 
mode which is this right now so with the
gaps<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.340> would<00:03:38.430> provide<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:39.060> recoil<00:03:39.510> or

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
gaps it would provide some recoil or

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.680 
gaps it would provide some recoil or
some<00:03:40.140> smash<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.209> there<00:03:42.209> are<00:03:42.300> two<00:03:42.450> different

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
some smash and there are two different

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.780 
some smash and there are two different
parts<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.230> could<00:03:43.500> turn<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.980> into<00:03:44.070> defense

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
parts so you could turn it into defense

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.790 
parts so you could turn it into defense
mode<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.920> could<00:03:46.920> get<00:03:47.070> into<00:03:47.370> defense<00:03:47.700> mode<00:03:47.850> and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
mode I could get into defense mode and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.320 
mode I could get into defense mode and
this<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:49.920> defense<00:03:50.160> mode<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.580> more<00:03:50.760> rounded

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.210 

more<00:03:54.330> defensive<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.080> which<00:03:55.590> reminds<00:03:55.980> me<00:03:56.100> a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
more defensive like which reminds me a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.940 
more defensive like which reminds me a
lot<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.910> shield<00:03:57.840> 130<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:01.709> pretty

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
lot like shield 130 so that's pretty

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:15.040 
lot like shield 130 so that's pretty
neat<00:04:02.690> for<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:04.260> track

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.160 

and<00:04:15.140> last<00:04:15.860> but<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.160> least<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:17.600> performance

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
and last but not least the performance

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.030 
and last but not least the performance
tip<00:04:18.380> or<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.739> bottom<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.630> s<00:04:21.080> or<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.440> round

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
tip or the bottom this is a s or a round

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.820 
tip or the bottom this is a s or a round
sharp<00:04:22.790> as<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.810> see<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.170> kind<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.440> shaped

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
sharp as you can see it's kind of shaped

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.440 
sharp as you can see it's kind of shaped
like<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.490> WD<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:28.160> plate<00:04:28.700> is<00:04:28.940> free

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
like a WD but this plate is free

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.940 
like a WD but this plate is free
spinning<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.080> it's<00:04:30.230> kind<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:30.680> the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
spinning so it's kind of like the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.710 
spinning so it's kind of like the
opposite<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.670> ewd<00:04:32.540> with<00:04:33.470> ewg<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:35.270> outside

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
opposite of ewd with ewg this outside

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.510 
opposite of ewd with ewg this outside
part<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.110> stationary<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.040> middle<00:04:37.280> part

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
part is stationary and the middle part

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.390 
part is stationary and the middle part
is<00:04:37.700> free<00:04:38.360> spinning<00:04:38.720> but<00:04:39.200> it's<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:40.010> opposite

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
is free spinning but it's the opposite

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.280 
is free spinning but it's the opposite
the<00:04:40.580> outside<00:04:40.910> part<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.330> free<00:04:41.690> spinning<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.200> the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
the outside part is free spinning in the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.010 
the outside part is free spinning in the
middle<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:43.030> stationary<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.540> what<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.780> does

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
middle is stationary so what this does

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.560 
middle is stationary so what this does
it's<00:04:45.290> supposed<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.980> keep<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.460> balanced<00:04:47.060> as<00:04:47.240> its

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it's supposed to keep it balanced as its

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.620 
it's supposed to keep it balanced as its
spinning<00:04:47.870> inside<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.790> base<00:04:50.180> Stadium

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
spinning inside of the base Stadium

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.620 
spinning inside of the base Stadium
which<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.620> pretty<00:04:51.980> neat<00:04:52.280> feature<00:04:52.630> I've

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
which is a pretty neat feature I've

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.410 
which is a pretty neat feature I've
never<00:04:54.200> messed<00:04:54.500> around<00:04:54.620> with<00:04:54.980> this<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.400> I'm<00:04:56.270> not

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
never messed around with this so I'm not

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.810 
never messed around with this so I'm not
sure<00:04:56.480> how<00:04:56.900> well<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.230> performs<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:57.950> we'll<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.790> a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
sure how well it performs so we'll do a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.890 
sure how well it performs so we'll do a
test<00:04:59.510> spin<00:04:59.750> after<00:05:00.230> this<00:05:01.390> now<00:05:02.390> let's<00:05:02.630> put<00:05:02.810> the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
test spin after this now let's put the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.920 
test spin after this now let's put the
bait<00:05:03.050> weigh<00:05:03.200> together

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
bait weigh together

Seoul<00:06:03.870> blades<00:06:04.200> in<00:06:04.560> my<00:06:04.740> opinion<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.370> think<00:06:05.400> it

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
Seoul blades in my opinion I think it

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.620 
Seoul blades in my opinion I think it
looks<00:06:06.600> like<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:07.110> more<00:06:08.100> defensive<00:06:08.910> type<00:06:09.210> of<00:06:09.420> babe

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
looks like a more defensive type of babe

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.770 
looks like a more defensive type of babe
way<00:06:09.780> just<00:06:10.050> because<00:06:10.290> how<00:06:10.500> rounded<00:06:11.130> it<00:06:11.250> is<00:06:11.400> and

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
way just because how rounded it is and

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.410 
way just because how rounded it is and
how<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.810> track<00:06:13.440> could<00:06:13.710> turn<00:06:13.950> into<00:06:14.160> a

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
how the track could turn into a

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.180 
how the track could turn into a
defensive<00:06:17.030> mode<00:06:18.110> which<00:06:19.110> resembles<00:06:19.680> shield

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
defensive mode which resembles shield

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
defensive mode which resembles shield
130<00:06:20.670> also<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:22.230> bottom<00:06:22.650> seems<00:06:23.310> more<00:06:23.610> defensive

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
130 also the bottom seems more defensive

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.560 
130 also the bottom seems more defensive
like<00:06:24.420> more<00:06:25.250> balanced<00:06:26.250> like<00:06:26.430> as<00:06:26.610> well<00:06:26.910> maybe

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
like more balanced like as well maybe

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.350 
like more balanced like as well maybe
even<00:06:27.870> stamina<00:06:28.320> like<00:06:28.730> so<00:06:29.730> that<00:06:29.940> is<00:06:30.060> my<00:06:30.210> unboxing

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
even stamina like so that is my unboxing

this<00:06:44.010> is<00:06:44.070> a<00:06:44.220> really<00:06:44.640> cool<00:06:44.940> looking<00:06:45.270> beyblade

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
this is a really cool looking beyblade

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.350 
this is a really cool looking beyblade
if<00:06:46.530> you're<00:06:46.710> going<00:06:46.860> to<00:06:47.010> get<00:06:47.250> this<00:06:47.430> I<00:06:47.669> recommend

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
if you're going to get this I recommend

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.980 
if you're going to get this I recommend
either<00:06:48.630> getting<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.410> red<00:06:49.710> one<00:06:50.490> or<00:06:50.730> the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
either getting the red one or the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.620 
either getting the red one or the
eclipse<00:06:51.990> version<00:06:53.030> just<00:06:54.030> because<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:54.390> think

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
eclipse version just because I think

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.750 
eclipse version just because I think
they<00:06:54.930> looked<00:06:55.169> a<00:06:55.320> lot<00:06:55.560> better<00:06:55.740> although<00:06:56.520> this

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
they looked a lot better although this

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.520 
they looked a lot better although this
looks<00:06:57.000> really<00:06:57.180> cool<00:06:57.510> as<00:06:57.690> well<00:06:57.960> I<00:06:57.990> think<00:06:58.260> the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
looks really cool as well I think the

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.650 
looks really cool as well I think the
other<00:06:58.650> two<00:06:58.890> look<00:06:59.070> really<00:06:59.120> better<00:07:00.120> than<00:07:00.450> this

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
other two look really better than this

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.200 
other two look really better than this
one<00:07:01.100> but<00:07:02.100> that's<00:07:02.220> up<00:07:02.430> to<00:07:02.460> you<00:07:02.669> that's<00:07:02.820> just<00:07:02.970> my
