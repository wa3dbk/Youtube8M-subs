space<00:04:03.870> there's<00:04:04.560> about<00:04:04.710> 25<00:04:05.130> cubic<00:04:05.640> feet<00:04:05.790> of

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
space there's about 25 cubic feet of

space there's about 25 cubic feet of
storage<00:04:06.030> behind<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.050> back<00:04:07.200> seat<00:04:07.530> which

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
storage behind the back seat which

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.130 
storage behind the back seat which
expands<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.880> 55<00:04:09.450> cubes

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
expands to 55 cubes

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.500 
expands to 55 cubes
when<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.800> seats<00:04:11.130> are<00:04:11.310> folded<00:04:11.670> flat<00:04:17.510> Tony

when the back seats are folded flat Tony

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.090 
when the back seats are folded flat Tony
is<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.049> about<00:04:19.230> time<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.530> talked<00:04:19.739> about<00:04:19.950> what's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
is it about time we talked about what's

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.770 
is it about time we talked about what's
ultimately<00:04:20.520> most<00:04:20.760> important<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.330> driving

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
ultimately most important the driving

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.850 
ultimately most important the driving
experience<00:04:21.980> bro<00:04:22.980> that's<00:04:23.610> my<00:04:23.730> line<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.860> just

average in my book yeah we're on a nice

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.230 
average in my book yeah we're on a nice
curve<00:05:21.630> here<00:05:22.200> handles<00:05:22.800> curves<00:05:23.130> okay<00:05:23.520> those<00:05:24.210> are

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
curve here handles curves okay those are

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.000 
curve here handles curves okay those are
not<00:05:24.390> curves<00:05:24.630> really<00:05:24.840> nice<00:05:25.110> there's<00:05:25.560> no<00:05:25.740> wobble

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
not curves really nice there's no wobble

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.910 
not curves really nice there's no wobble
there's<00:05:26.520> no<00:05:26.670> play<00:05:27.030> no<00:05:27.590> steering<00:05:28.590> is<00:05:28.770> very

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
there's no play no steering is very

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.870 
there's no play no steering is very
tight<00:05:29.780> good<00:05:30.780> power<00:05:31.020> right<00:05:31.440> oh<00:05:31.620> yeah<00:05:32.010> I'm

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
tight good power right oh yeah I'm

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.220 
tight good power right oh yeah I'm
barely<00:05:33.180> touching<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.630> puddle<00:05:33.960> right<00:05:33.990> now

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
barely touching the puddle right now

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.810 
barely touching the puddle right now
we're<00:05:34.500> going<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:34.920> almost<00:05:35.100> 50<00:05:35.400> miles<00:05:35.520> an<00:05:35.730> hour

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
we're going in almost 50 miles an hour

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.140 
we're going in almost 50 miles an hour
so<00:05:36.140> there<00:05:37.140> is<00:05:37.350> a<00:05:37.380> lot<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.620> criticism<00:05:37.860> on<00:05:38.790> the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
so there is a lot of criticism on the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.110 
so there is a lot of criticism on the
base<00:05:39.540> 2<00:05:39.990> liter<00:05:40.290> engine<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.490> if<00:05:41.610> you<00:05:41.730> listen<00:05:42.090> to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
base 2 liter engine so if you listen to

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.240 
base 2 liter engine so if you listen to
the<00:05:42.300> experts<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:43.470> really<00:05:43.860> want<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.100> upgrade

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
the experts you really want to upgrade

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.290 
the experts you really want to upgrade
to<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:45.000> 2.4<00:05:45.690> liter<00:05:46.040> for<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.100> power<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.640> to<00:05:48.150> me

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
to this 2.4 liter for the power it to me

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.160 
to this 2.4 liter for the power it to me
in<00:05:48.630> highway<00:05:49.170> driving<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.980> hills<00:05:51.170> normal

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
in highway driving on hills normal

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.830 
in highway driving on hills normal
driving<00:05:52.440> conditions<00:05:53.130> in<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.150> ample<00:05:54.660> power

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
driving conditions in that ample power

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.020 
driving conditions in that ample power
and<00:05:55.470> this<00:05:55.560> is<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.710> 6-speed<00:05:56.280> automatic<00:05:56.790> correct

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
and this is a 6-speed automatic correct

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.850 
and this is a 6-speed automatic correct
correct<00:05:57.570> so<00:05:58.290> when<00:05:58.440> you're<00:05:58.560> out<00:05:58.590> on<00:05:58.800> the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
correct so when you're out on the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.320 
correct so when you're out on the
highway<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.280> get<00:05:59.460> up<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.670> those<00:05:59.820> speeds<00:05:59.970> a

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
highway to get up to those speeds a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.820 
highway to get up to those speeds a
steering<00:06:00.930> is<00:06:01.020> very<00:06:01.050> low<00:06:01.440> so<00:06:01.470> you're<00:06:01.710> not

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
steering is very low so you're not

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.570 
steering is very low so you're not
getting<00:06:01.980> a<00:06:02.100> lot<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.250> engine<00:06:02.610> noise<00:06:02.780> so<00:06:03.780> overall

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
getting a lot of engine noise so overall

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.730 
getting a lot of engine noise so overall
