jetpacking<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.770> digging<00:00:20.130> i<00:00:20.760> put<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> up

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
jetpacking so I'm digging i put it up

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
jetpacking so I'm digging i put it up
and<00:00:22.170> show<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.410> why<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.710> probably<00:00:23.160> shouldn't

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and show you why you probably shouldn't

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.640 
and show you why you probably shouldn't
I<00:00:23.910> mean<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> sake<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.260> challenge

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I mean for the sake of the challenge

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980 
I mean for the sake of the challenge
hell<00:00:25.890> yeah<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.279> ahead<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.820> whatever<00:00:27.119> but

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
hell yeah go ahead do it whatever but

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
hell yeah go ahead do it whatever but
you<00:00:28.080> probably<00:00:28.260> shouldn't<00:00:28.619> jetpack<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> try

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you probably shouldn't jetpack and try

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
you probably shouldn't jetpack and try
and<00:00:29.820> shoot<00:00:30.029> people<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and shoot people because I'm on the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.959 
and shoot people because I'm on the
ground<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.859> strafe<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> air

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
ground I can strafe you're in the air

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.330 
ground I can strafe you're in the air
you<00:00:33.329> can't<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.920> comes<00:00:35.100> an

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you can't really so there comes an

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.030 
you can't really so there comes an
example<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.660> straight<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.020> take<00:00:37.890> his

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
example I just look straight up take his

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.380 
example I just look straight up take his
head<00:00:38.070> off<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
head off it's not it's really not that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
head off it's not it's really not that
hard<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.899> they're<00:00:40.079> 21<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
hard so they're 21 and one with a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040 
hard so they're 21 and one with a
running<00:00:41.700> riot<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.390> trying<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> burst<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
running riot I'm not trying to burst in

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
running riot I'm not trying to burst in
just<00:00:43.230> saying<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.649> how<00:00:43.739> easy<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> when

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
just saying that's how easy it is when

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
just saying that's how easy it is when
you're<00:00:45.539> against<00:00:45.840> an<00:00:45.899> opponent<00:00:46.170> they're<00:00:46.559> just

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you're against an opponent they're just

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.240 
you're against an opponent they're just
fly<00:00:46.920> straight<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.250> pretty

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
fly straight up you know it's pretty

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.860 
fly straight up you know it's pretty
simple<00:00:51.020> what<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> wanted<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> talk<00:00:52.590> about<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
simple what I wanted to talk about is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
simple what I wanted to talk about is
the<00:00:54.870> relationship<00:00:55.320> between<00:00:55.670> sensitivity

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the relationship between sensitivity

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.560 
the relationship between sensitivity
unscathed<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.690> Scott<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.949> obviously

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
unscathed and Scott because obviously

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.250 
unscathed and Scott because obviously
games<00:01:00.570> don't<00:01:00.840> have

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
games don't have

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.299 
games don't have
you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> move<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.940> fast<00:01:03.480> skov<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.070> can

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you can move as fast skov as you can

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.999 
you can move as fast skov as you can
unscathed<00:01:06.000> which<00:01:06.630> makes<00:01:07.110> sense<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.890> me

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
unscathed which makes sense they get me

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.609 
unscathed which makes sense they get me
wrong<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.549> I've<00:01:09.450> never<00:01:09.720> understood<00:01:09.899> why<00:01:10.439> they

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
wrong but I've never understood why they

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.080 
wrong but I've never understood why they
aren't<00:01:10.799> changeable<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.640> shouldn't<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
aren't changeable they shouldn't be the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 
aren't changeable they shouldn't be the
same<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.570> personally<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> mean<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.189> people

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
same thing personally I mean and people

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
same thing personally I mean and people
may<00:01:14.909> say<00:01:15.119> oh<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.689> realistic<00:01:15.960> because

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
may say oh that's not realistic because

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
may say oh that's not realistic because
you<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.399> just<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:18.000> works

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you know that's just how a game works

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.810 
you know that's just how a game works
basically<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.619> real<00:01:19.920> life<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> can't<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
basically in real life you can't you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080 
basically in real life you can't you
can't<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.149> go<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.770> missed<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:23.070> shot<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.729> think

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
can't just go I missed our shot I think

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.940 
can't just go I missed our shot I think
it's<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.600> got<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.930> too<00:01:25.140> high<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's because I got it on too high of a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.230 
it's because I got it on too high of a
sensitivity<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.789> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.940> turn<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
sensitivity I'm just going to turn that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
sensitivity I'm just going to turn that
now<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.229> turning<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> yeah<00:01:29.009> oh

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
now just a little bit turning it yeah oh

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.440 
now just a little bit turning it yeah oh
my<00:01:29.820> god<00:01:30.030> i<00:01:30.240> turned<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.149> bit<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
my god i turned it out as a bit of a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.059 
my god i turned it out as a bit of a
spiel<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.289> could<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.770> said<00:01:34.890> yeah

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
spiel when I could have just said yeah

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.800 
spiel when I could have just said yeah
actually<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.940> not<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.270> happens<00:01:36.539> in<00:01:36.630> real

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually that's not what happens in real

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
actually that's not what happens in real
life<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.380> didn't<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.220> I'm<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
life but I didn't because I'm in the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.440 
life but I didn't because I'm in the
indeed<00:01:39.229> yeah<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.090> anyway<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.300> I<00:01:42.330> was

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
indeed yeah so I anyway what I was

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.609 
indeed yeah so I anyway what I was
saying<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:44.479> why<00:01:45.479> can't<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.080> change<00:01:46.350> because

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
saying is why can't they change because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
saying is why can't they change because
if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.830> turn<00:01:47.039> your<00:01:47.190> sensitivity<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
if you turn your sensitivity up to like

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
if you turn your sensitivity up to like
10<00:01:48.179> in<00:01:48.630> breach<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.380> your<00:01:52.380> sniper<00:01:52.890> scope

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
10 in breach you can your sniper scope

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
uh get it anyway but I wondered why you

uh get it anyway but I wondered why you
can<00:02:17.200> change<00:02:17.499> the<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.579> if<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:19.180> want<00:02:19.359> it<00:02:19.480> i'm

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
can change the to like if I want it i'm

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.720 
can change the to like if I want it i'm
not<00:02:19.780> saying<00:02:20.079> make<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.129> you<00:02:21.219> can<00:02:21.400> you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
not saying make it so that you can you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.330 
not saying make it so that you can you
could<00:02:21.879> they<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.480> same<00:02:22.689> speed<00:02:23.049> or

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
could they can be the same speed or

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.459 
could they can be the same speed or
sculpting<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.519> be<00:02:24.609> faster<00:02:25.120> than<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:26.049> DMR

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
sculpting can be faster than the DMR

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.319 
sculpting can be faster than the DMR
unscarred<00:02:27.010> I'm<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.489> saying<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:27.939> if<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.239> was

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
unscarred I'm just saying like if it was

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.770 
unscarred I'm just saying like if it was
tweakable<00:02:28.719> fabulous<00:02:30.239> i'm<00:02:31.239> sure<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.540> can't<00:02:31.689> be

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
tweakable fabulous i'm sure it can't be

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.589 
tweakable fabulous i'm sure it can't be
that<00:02:31.810> hard<00:02:32.139> right<00:02:32.969> probably<00:02:33.969> is<00:02:34.060> actually

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
that hard right probably is actually

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.390 
that hard right probably is actually

black ops and halo reach which is
interesting<00:02:49.709> now<00:02:50.709> another<00:02:51.400> thing<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.730> don't

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
interesting now another thing I don't

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.629 
interesting now another thing I don't
understand<00:02:52.359> is<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.049> totally<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.400> why

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
understand is like I totally get why

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.869 
understand is like I totally get why
black<00:02:54.909> ops<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.299> on<00:02:55.480> ps3<00:02:55.829> because<00:02:56.829> that<00:02:57.609> they

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
black ops is on ps3 because that they

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.490 
black ops is on ps3 because that they
wouldn't<00:02:58.150> really<00:02:58.299> have<00:02:58.510> anything<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:59.019> ps3

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
wouldn't really have anything on ps3

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.580 
wouldn't really have anything on ps3
otherwise<00:03:00.159> but<00:03:01.060> there's<00:03:01.750> there's<00:03:02.199> people<00:03:02.500> on

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
otherwise but there's there's people on

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.670 
otherwise but there's there's people on
xbox<00:03:03.239> buying<00:03:04.239> black<00:03:04.480> ops<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:05.109> they<00:03:05.469> don't

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
xbox buying black ops that they don't

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.550 
xbox buying black ops that they don't
get<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.829> look-in<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.480> because<00:03:07.629> Halo

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
get a look-in but just because Halo

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.909 
get a look-in but just because Halo
Reach<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.799> on<00:03:09.099> xbox<00:03:09.340> 360<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.560> starcraft<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.769> on

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
Reach is on xbox 360 and starcraft is on

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.969 
Reach is on xbox 360 and starcraft is on
pc<00:03:12.400> blackops<00:03:13.299> therefore<00:03:14.109> must<00:03:14.319> have<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.709> be<00:03:14.829> on

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:14.979 
pc blackops therefore must have to be on

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.759 
pc blackops therefore must have to be on
ps3<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.669> know<00:03:15.729> if<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.180> wasn't<00:03:16.329> on<00:03:16.540> ps3<00:03:16.959> then

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
ps3 and I know if it wasn't on ps3 then

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.860 
ps3 and I know if it wasn't on ps3 then
people<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.459> ps3<00:03:18.729> wouldn't<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.269> looking<00:03:19.629> so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
people on ps3 wouldn't get looking so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.749 
people on ps3 wouldn't get looking so
what<00:03:20.019> I'm<00:03:20.139> getting<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:21.099> think<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.609> should

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:21.759 
what I'm getting at is I think it should

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:27.809 
what I'm getting at is I think it should
be<00:03:21.989> one<00:03:22.989> platform<00:03:23.409> or<00:03:25.019> both<00:03:26.019> platforms<00:03:26.819> you

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
be one platform or both platforms you

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.119 
be one platform or both platforms you
know<00:03:27.939> so<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.569> think<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:31.139> if<00:03:32.139> reaches<00:03:33.009> on

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
know so I think that if I if reaches on

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.939 
know so I think that if I if reaches on
xbox<00:03:33.459> 360<00:03:33.819> which<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.389> has<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.169> think<00:03:35.769> that

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
xbox 360 which it has to be I think that

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.990 
xbox 360 which it has to be I think that
black<00:03:36.370> box<00:03:36.519> should<00:03:36.759> be<00:03:36.819> on<00:03:37.090> xbox<00:03:37.870> 360<00:03:38.560> also<00:03:39.040> but

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
black box should be on xbox 360 also but

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.270 
black box should be on xbox 360 also but
then<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.509> unfair<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:40.959> ps3<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:42.040> don't

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
then it's unfair and ps3 so I just don't

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.530 
then it's unfair and ps3 so I just don't
get<00:03:42.430> why<00:03:42.609> they<00:03:42.729> don't<00:03:42.879> have<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.239> two<00:03:43.359> i<00:03:43.389> know

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
get why they don't have the two i know

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.039 
get why they don't have the two i know
it<00:03:43.780> cost<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.169> more<00:03:44.379> in<00:03:44.470> price<00:03:44.739> one<00:03:45.069> but<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.180> I

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
it cost the more in price one but I I

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.140 
it cost the more in price one but I I
think<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:49.030> safe<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.389> say<00:03:49.629> that<00:03:50.909> people<00:03:51.909> in

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
think it's safe to say that people in

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.420 
think it's safe to say that people in

put<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.239> ps3<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> is<00:04:23.580> probably

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
put this on ps3 and it is probably

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.820 
put this on ps3 and it is probably
because<00:04:23.940> their<00:04:24.270> energy<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.530> get<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
because their energy don't get the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.300 
because their energy don't get the
support<00:04:26.190> from<00:04:27.030> Microsoft<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.500> on

support from Microsoft to have it on on
the<00:04:29.580> Xbox<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.419> don't<00:04:30.600> think<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.900> should

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
the Xbox but I don't think that should

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.810 
the Xbox but I don't think that should
be<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.229> case<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.680> major<00:04:31.979> league<00:04:32.250> gaming<00:04:32.550> its

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
be the case is major league gaming its

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.900 
be the case is major league gaming its
competitive<00:04:33.509> gaming<00:04:33.720> platform<00:04:34.910> they

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
competitive gaming platform they

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.060 
competitive gaming platform they
shouldn't<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.690> be<00:04:36.810> bribed<00:04:37.110> in<00:04:37.770> order<00:04:38.039> to

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169

put it on there i think that if it if
it's<00:04:40.410> really<00:04:40.770> all<00:04:40.889> about<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.310> game<00:04:41.490> that's

what this event is about I'd have it on

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070 
what this event is about I'd have it on
both<00:04:43.949> platforms<00:04:44.250> because<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.660> would<00:04:45.780> be<00:04:45.990> it

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
both platforms because it would be it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.230 
both platforms because it would be it
would<00:04:46.110> be<00:04:46.320> fair<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.919> know<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.580> also<00:04:47.849> another

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
are going to be i think is april first

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.080 
are going to be i think is april first
that<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.629> in<00:05:27.139> columbus<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.860> think<00:05:28.189> and<00:05:28.879> also

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
that the in columbus I think and also

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.300 
that the in columbus I think and also
that<00:05:29.599> they're<00:05:30.259> talking<00:05:30.500> about<00:05:30.560> having<00:05:30.889> sprint

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
that they're talking about having sprint

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.589 
that they're talking about having sprint
as<00:05:31.520> as<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:33.169> normal<00:05:33.520> armor<00:05:34.520> ability<00:05:35.000> which<00:05:35.300> I

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
as as the normal armor ability which I

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.839 
as as the normal armor ability which I
think's<00:05:35.990> more<00:05:36.050> less<00:05:36.379> because<00:05:36.620> if<00:05:36.919> it's<00:05:37.759> a

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
think's more less because if it's a

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.709 
think's more less because if it's a
standard<00:05:38.210> for<00:05:38.449> everyone<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:39.050> loses<00:05:39.259> its

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
standard for everyone it loses its

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.709 
standard for everyone it loses its
advantages<00:05:41.719> yes<00:05:42.520> but<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.819> also<00:05:44.150> experienced

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
advantages yes but and also experienced

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.810 
advantages yes but and also experienced
pretty<00:05:44.930> crap<00:05:45.139> because<00:05:45.469> you<00:05:46.430> can<00:05:46.580> hear<00:05:46.819> them
