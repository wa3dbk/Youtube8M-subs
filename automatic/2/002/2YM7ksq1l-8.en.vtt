00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.600
two things have happened since the last
time we reported on the abarth version

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.150
of the Fiat 500 subcompact one is that
fiat has made some improvements for 2015

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.670
and the other is that cars.com pitted
this car against seven other performance

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.260
versions of compact and subcompact cars
in the thirty thousand dollar cheap

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.050
Speed Challenge let's take a look at
what's new what's good what's bad and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.480
how this car fared against seven
competitors now here's what's new for

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.940
2015 the biggest is a new instrument
panel it is a seven inch color display

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.540
replacing kind of rudimentary gauges
with a loaf I screen in the middle so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.140
you still have the analog turbo boost
gauge on the left but you get a lot more

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.280
information here in the center and
actually kind of classes up the whole

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.020
interior quite a bit now the car also
has bluetooth standard now for streaming

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.949
audio and hands-free telephone
connectivity which it didn't have before

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.070
unfortunately because there's no real
interface you have to pair your phone

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
using voice commands which is a little
tedious but it does work

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
speaking of interfaces there's no
navigation option in the dashboard but

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.440
you can get instead a six-hundred-dollar
tomtom unit that fits into the dashboard

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.709
and is powered there's also now USB port
for connecting to the stereo and another

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.130
one in the glove compartment that is for
charging only now they're a couple

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.310
shortcomings of the 500 in general that
can't be ignored

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.899
one is Comfort many of our editors have
complained that the bottom cushion for

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.319
the driver doesn't tilt which especially
makes it hard if you have a manual

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.530
transmission because you're kind of your
thigh is hitting the cushion you're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.590
fighting it just to press down the
clutch pedal and the steering wheel

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.060
tilts but it doesn't telescope so all
told not the mix that you want to get

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.440
comfortable up

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.590
visibility's and other things sitting up
high like this is actually pretty good

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.550
but there are some blind spots over the
right shoulder because of the Big B

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.250
pillar here and especially when checking
over your left shoulder the 500 abarth

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.510
turns out to have a couple personalities
or at least gave us very different

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.129
impressions in two different uses one on
the street we were pretty disappointed

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.540
one of the reasons is busy

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.859
260 on this car in our testing was eight
point eight seconds is that even quick

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:28.189
the Ford Fiesta ST which is similar in
size did a second faster the volkswagen

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.079
GTI two seconds faster and the quickest
one in our test the subaru WRX did it in

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.069
less than six seconds now the
specifications actually aren't that bad

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.930
for the car if you look at the engine is
a 1.4 liter turbocharged four-cylinder

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.159
with a hundred sixty horsepower
170-pound speed of torque

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.720
now the company says the torque peak
comes to 2500 rpm and it just doesn't

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.579
feel that way things don't get
interesting until 3,000 3,500 at best

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.569
the car actually has classic turbo lag
something that a lot of other

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.799
manufacturers have been eradicated I
kind of feel like you need more torque

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.169
at low rpm it kind of makes this car
slow off the line especially because

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:14.840
this one has a five-speed manual when it
really needs a six breaking is an area

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.730
that was a little bit mixed overall we
like the feel of the brake pedal on the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.260
linearity they feel strong but
unfortunately in our regimented testing

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.879
in panic stops the car got really really
skittish which is in uncomfortable

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.639
feeling around town the handling is
pretty good the steering feels good

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.659
a little bit of a problem with body roll
though I have to say with the height the

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.040
short-wheelbase the narrowness it feels
a little tipsy to me now i'm not saying

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.430
the car is going to tip over it's really
just a feeling which isn't great

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.069
here's where they lose me the turning
circle is ponderously wide almost 38

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.639
feet wide in this version that seven
feet wider than the regular 507 feet so

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.129
if you're in a city and you want to make
a quick u-turn

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.409
this isn't the one for it and another
short coming for let's say in more

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.079
enclosed environment like the city is
the exhaust sound it's very noisy it's

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.630
just overdone now internet let's be
clear it's not just me that thinks I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.799
work with people who are roughly half my
age and they agree that it is

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.110
unrelenting and farting they could make
it a little bit more acceptable for

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.190
everyday use

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.810
here's where we got our surprise

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
after we got off the drag strip where we
deserve to 60 and panic stops we went on

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.810
a road course and we found this to feel
like a very different car for one thing

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.500
it handled very well maybe some body
roll but the car had p0 narrow pirelli

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.150
tyres summer tires that had excellent
grip didn't feel like we're going to tip

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.290
over the handling was good you think
about it on the track you can keep the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.130
revs high in that case it's really
entertaining little engine and short of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.410
a panic stop the brakes feel strong
confidence inspiring even the exhaust

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.790
sound around a racetrack

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.650
who cares now we put more emphasis on
performance for the chief Speed

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.630
Challenge but cars.com always looks at
the big picture value roominess etc and

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.290
unfortunately a little bit of fun on the
track for the fiat 500 abarth wasn't

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.030
enough to overcome test scores that were
you know at best around average out of

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.800
eight cars it came in eight now if
you're looking for an alternative I'd

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.620
say for a small car that's just raucous
good fun go for the Ford Fiesta ST if

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.620
you want more size utility refinement
efficiency all that stuff I would go

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.940
with the volkswagen GTI it had some of
the best numbers across the board in our

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.400
tests and the one that matters most

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.870
it came in number one
