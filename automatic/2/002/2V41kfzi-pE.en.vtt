00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.360
 Donetsk and rock bands want to mark on 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.850
 in fact that pleasantly surprised everyone 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.610
 well everything is real musicians 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 vocalist all by weight 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.940
 but it is difficult to choose 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 business and tomorrow on Lenin Square will 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.650

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.020
 how peacetime really is exactly 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 Now at this time I think it is 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.930
 movement to the pen 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.969
 for Julia this is not the first performance on 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.219
 Donbass earlier singer came to 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.500
 Lugansk then hut announced it in 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.299
 the search room suddenly went out the light but 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.280
 despite electricity problems 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.170
 the musicians went on stage and to the acoustics 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.379
 played favorite songs for their 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.379
 fans 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.590
 and not even a means 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.590
 but 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.040
 and most 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.400
 the road is my home and 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.939
 our tap here is creative and not 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.650
 later representatives of this region 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.480
 I can say that a lot of creative 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.280
 people so rock should live 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.239
 it's pretty depressing because of the war 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.609
 Itâ€™s all as if very special and seems 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.220
 no one wants to talk here 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.200
 and got here here saw a lot 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.349
 people who did not even expect 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 see you know so little 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.680
 celebration 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.590
 is over 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.590

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.390
