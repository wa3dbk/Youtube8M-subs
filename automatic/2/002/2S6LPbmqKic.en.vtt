you're looking inside of it and the gold
lines<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> actual<00:01:08.310> connector<00:01:08.850> pins<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
lines are the actual connector pins and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
lines are the actual connector pins and
then<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.010> showing<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.000> insert<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
then I'm showing that you can insert the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
then I'm showing that you can insert the
wire<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.770> into<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.070> end<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.729> careful<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
wire just into the end be careful you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.820 
wire just into the end be careful you
don't<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> very<00:01:16.350> far<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
don't want to start it very far just a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.179 
don't want to start it very far just a
little<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> look<00:01:17.729> inside

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
little bit and then when you look inside

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.170 
little bit and then when you look inside
from<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> angle<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> actually<00:01:20.909> use<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
from the angle you can actually use a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
from the angle you can actually use a
knife<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:22.020> attack<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.220> something<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.640> push<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
knife or attack or something to push it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.690 
knife or attack or something to push it
back<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.930> way<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> doesn't<00:01:25.439> jump<00:01:25.950> across<00:01:26.310> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
back that way it doesn't jump across in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.530 
back that way it doesn't jump across in
short<00:01:27.659> anything<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> should<00:01:30.390> put

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
short anything out then I you should put

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
short anything out then I you should put
a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.689> hot<00:01:30.990> glue<00:01:31.189> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.640> top<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.119> hold<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a little hot glue on the top to hold it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.160 
a little hot glue on the top to hold it
in<00:01:33.540> place<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.790> used<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> zip<00:01:36.329> tie<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> hold<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in place and used a zip tie to hold it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.060 
in place and used a zip tie to hold it
to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.939> other<00:01:38.939> wires<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.740> showing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to the other wires and I'm also showing

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.639 
to the other wires and I'm also showing
the<00:01:41.369> inside<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> glue<00:01:42.930> my

camera is a piece of crap takes horrible
horrible<00:01:46.170> pictures<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.920> why<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.130> next

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
horrible pictures that's why this next

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
horrible pictures that's why this next
picture<00:01:48.240> looks<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.780> weird<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.799> was

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
picture looks kind of weird it was

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.560 
picture looks kind of weird it was
actually<00:01:50.460> taken<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> scanner<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
actually taken with a scanner and you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.760 
actually taken with a scanner and you
can<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.200> hooked<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> hard

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
can see that it's hooked to the hard

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.450 
can see that it's hooked to the hard
drive<00:01:54.079> connector<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.740> had<00:01:56.070> glue<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
drive connector and then I had glue the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880 
drive connector and then I had glue the
LEDs<00:01:56.880> into<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.570> top<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> hard<00:01:58.380> drive<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
LEDs into the top of the hard drive and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920 
LEDs into the top of the hard drive and
then<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.969> showing<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then I'm just showing it again in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.520 
then I'm just showing it again in
working<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> everything<00:02:02.189> works<00:02:02.399> pretty<00:02:03.119> easy

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
working and everything works pretty easy

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
working and everything works pretty easy
just<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.680> little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> soldering<00:02:06.090> Owen

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
just a little bit of soldering Owen

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.309 
just a little bit of soldering Owen
you're<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> need<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> resistor

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
you're going to need a resistor

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.559 
you're going to need a resistor
let's<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.069> find<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.549> how<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.329> setting

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
let's just find out how you're setting

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.009 
let's just find out how you're setting
up<00:02:12.689> your<00:02:12.810> LEDs<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:14.120> how<00:02:15.120> much<00:02:15.299> voltage<00:02:15.480> into<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
up your LEDs and how much voltage into a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.979 
up your LEDs and how much voltage into a
google<00:02:16.319> search<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:17.209> resistors<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.540> LEDs

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
google search for resistors with LEDs

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.750 
google search for resistors with LEDs
and<00:02:19.379> Wikipedia<00:02:20.249> he's<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.639> whole

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and Wikipedia he's got the whole

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.999 
and Wikipedia he's got the whole
breakdown
