00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello all welcome back to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 one more of our missions 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 or fast revilla by 10 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:29.670
 is on air plus a short episode 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 story magazine vogue dead book 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 social political figures no matter what the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 The invasion has already begun and everything 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 protect one of the best fighters in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 training for the occasion is the series for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.739
 weak also known as the best 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.280
 game against zombies in history has to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.079
 catch this game that is what we see today 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.879
 this game was born from the idea of making a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 first-person shooter game with 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 and that it was not just another 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.420
 that would join the best of the single 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 multiplayer player and that's where the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.949
 concept of making a multiplayer 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
 cooperative are the four players who 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.720
 help themselves all the time if they want to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 it's okay to play alone with 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.180
 computer controlling others 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.520
 characters but intelligence 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 is focused on helping the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.430
 player and it's embarrassing how much you 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.740
 playing it your way is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.689
 much more fun this is a game that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.680
 happens in chapters that each would be 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.140
 your own movie 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.259
 The goal is to go through the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.189
 next safe house there has groceries to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.560
 and then the next part begins and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.479
 each chapter has three to five 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130
 segments with a great battle in each 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.930
 Last 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.150
 during the phase the players advance and in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 certain moments appear the hordes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.250
 of zombies capable of all sides 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.500
 That's it causes the most common is that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 time that the differential of this game enters 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.430
 the director of artificial intelligence who 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.939
 ensures that the matches will never be 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 repeated at the beginning of each one the director 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.950
 determines where enemies will attack 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.009
 if the attack will be common it will be an invasion 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.940
 where the items will appear which will 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.730
 to show how many of these items 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.800
 as a player and must flee which way 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.690
 follow 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.950
 will be judges also heard the moments 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 special 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.370
 the director also controls the attention in 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.040
 up of players across the track 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.140
 sound that gets heavier lighter 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.940
 everything according to the progress of the game 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.750
 if you have little ammunition 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 energy 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.060
 after all it is a series of factors 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 all calculated in the name of experience 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.850
 that will repeat that it will never be the same in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.980
 each match 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.870
 communication between players is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.440
 important but not everyone can 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.940
 the same likes to speak in the microphone 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 recorded thousands and thousands of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.190
 of speech and dialogue with each character 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 a type speech here has guns 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.720
 there are five variations for each 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.400
 of the four characters and during 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 certain moments begin to 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.850
 talk to each other about worldly things 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.370
 So what's happening through the phase 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.709
 they also talk about things signs 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.400
 written on the wall or 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.150
 advice and reloads gun recovers 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.239
 energy 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.070
 that kind of thing the player talked about in the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.560
 microphone, the character speaks to his 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.720
 own store when the player runs out of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.299
 energy first, and specifies that the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.400
 other go there and help get up 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.829
 meanwhile he gets thrown on the floor 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.680
 with its history and defending itself 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.140
 if he falls three times then he dies and 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.720
 is out of the game but will come back more 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.880
 before this your players will not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.070
 resuscitate and with the defibrillator 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.100
 which is more a strategy point 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.400
 about the use of portable items left 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.019
 First aid kit 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.480
 carry a white weapon type a sword 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.290
 golf club or walk around with two 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.049
 pistols 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.840
 I get a Molotov cocktail, a grenade 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.720
 that catches the eye of the trash is always a 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.959
 Come on, another one's gonna charge again. 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.820
 adding variety because modes 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.560
 game are better than the other 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.170
 if so far it seems that this game 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.730
 too spectacular to try inside the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.470
 own instinct of passion an area of 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.560
 fan created content 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.410
 There are all sorts of things out there. 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.840
 character enemies weapon new campaigns 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.229
 and all I want to give another 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.670
 and to close the video will 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.530
 say that this 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.550
 just a general overview of the series for 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.170
 average so far are 12 games that if you 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 to buy is good live from today 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.760
 this seems to be the obvious but there is a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.550
 good reason for this 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.620
 Since its launch in 2009, many 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.570
 many updates happened and the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.300
 few add the content of the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.850
 first game the second until 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.010
 eventually he turned 12 and 13 in there 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.540
 all lcd missions two games 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.810
 before a large package that always 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.090
 it's for sale well cheap then 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.380
 do not waste time and take yours if it is 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.110
 Did not do that already. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.150
 the game is old and if you already have xin 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.770
 add there and enjoy to enter 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.570

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.600

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.710
