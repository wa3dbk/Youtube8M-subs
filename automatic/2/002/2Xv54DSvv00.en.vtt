00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.260
 announced in the previous vi 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.279
 recent times he recorded yesterday sometimes 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.280
 meeting what we're going to do 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.250
 packages against episode number one e 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.590
 we will open three packages or 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.090
 four good then as we can see 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:52.329
 so we have to buy then 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.329
 let's go upstairs 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 let's do this here yes yes affections 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 this is and we wait in the loads 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.870
 however that god is made under yours 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.010
 video because I found myself 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:17.650
 buy a refill 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:25.030
 I found myself buying the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:27.190
 recharge then I practically then precisely 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.300
 I wanted to believe he was making the video 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.910
 immediately and to what then 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.910
 they buy this perfect 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.780
 1575 just what we have on facebook vi 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 Lazio for the purchase 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.000
 then then then we then see a bit 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.740
 technically the transition stands 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.010
 by purchasing the credits that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.590
 we're going to use this for cows 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:08.360
 opening I don't know how I'll call it god 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 one and 1600 does little to you what is this 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 ancient 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.129
 what is silver for those looking for and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.129
 then there is a little 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 we hope 5 euros for now there 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.730
 we keep because I don't want to spend 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.190
 all together then let's go to the store 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.030
 we are the first packages faster than 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.160
 their choice 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:51.810

 and shirt that the walls 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.439
 ok let's go to open the second one 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.599
 package but this time I don't know how much 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:07.870
 worth that player I can't be a 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:10.500
 Greek post and then a to the right of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.520
 speed 90 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.520
 and berlin 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.510
 then we have 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.910
 if you remove this writing in front of 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:29.850
 everyone at the team stadium europa the morale 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.940
 tall mind you to sell me players 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.770
 then to apply with the 4 1 2 1 2 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:40.560
 this is quite good then we go 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.860
 also to see this we come this 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.550
 we ask this let's go this in 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.680
 our 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.680
 we see a little of all these things 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.289
 we also have the stadium while these 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.230
 boys and we reject girls with morale 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.870
 high I could also craft 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 the last package of the first episode 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.410
 we have not given in this precise 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:23.530
 moment be a little I have not read that it is 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:26.070
 released and 11 of the piero non del piero but 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.960
 what is pronounced almost the same way 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:34.590
 more savior than aronics 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.590
 doubt it is what to say 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.529
 and this one tastes more 15 percent 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.560
 ok ok 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:53.180
 ok 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:58.150
 the last deal for 4 5 1 that 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.150
 actually sell has a little something 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.780
 yes we do like hell 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.020
 there is one thing that we see ourselves on the outside and 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.819
 this certainly does not consume them and then 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.710
 the perfect graft guys for this 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.500
 episode is everything we have opened three 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.979
 packages we will have three each bet there 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:25.530
 see you at the next video and the next one 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.530
