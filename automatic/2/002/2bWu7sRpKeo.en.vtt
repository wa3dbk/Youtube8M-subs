00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.410
 the most important thing of this exercise 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.820
 explains that back 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.279
 you are going to pass as a lawyer 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.209
 there are two ways to do it 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.159
 there is a serious that can be the grip with the hands upwards down 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.640
 hararé 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.419
 Your opinion 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.199
 you can leave aside side are the marks 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.199
 with the separation of the ovens 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm going to grab the bar, the most important thing is to take care of your sword 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.819
 so 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.300
 what I will go ocular contract the muscles of the lower back 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.880
 and take booths the fish you have here 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.860
 possibly it's a little bit down 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 of the leader to avoid that streak of so many 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.250
 but that we can not modify 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.010
 karim is a little bit back 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.530
 the two feet are paid with the same separation of the shoulders 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.380
 and you will go down with the weight 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.390
 until forming a 90 degree angle in the vegas at the beginning you will feel a 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.450
 little complicated is another to get that they had knees 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 it is formed 90 degrees and turn 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.870
 the world will end until then you have completely doubts 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.300
 sachsenring higgins and feel 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.740
 who conquered the control of the muscles the author of the shots 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.880
 very red valdano 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 three times in a row 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.770
 one 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.770
 trying to keep vertical 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 it's a way of doing it 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 applause 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.840
 me for stealing with the grip 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630
 upside down with your hands 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 with the palms josé barros villalba here failed 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609
 and the separation of the legs is the same 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 but we are a little more open 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.639
 tomasa and vote 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.059
 the other fire 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.689
 a hand in that position and not vice versa that is called the same network 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.919
 Panama 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.349
 4 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.319
 but it's a matter of comfort 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 because if someone says that he feels he can lift a lot of weight 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.109
 to put it carlos lara 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.439
 is supposed to be in the field of design is a world 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.019
 because the weightlifter on the floor 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.480
 and you have to actually raise the weight of law in disuse raise from the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.549
 ground

 it's a public test you go up one two three 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.509
 is the one of his death 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.419
 from the structural calculation 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.510
 we will be like 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.510
 You have to be a little bit higher 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.409
