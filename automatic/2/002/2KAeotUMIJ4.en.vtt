I've<00:00:35.460> been<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.790> college<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.210> day<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.420> that's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I've been at college all day so that's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.030 
I've been at college all day so that's
why<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.840> video<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.260> coming<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> not

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
why this video is coming now and not

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.450 
why this video is coming now and not
earlier<00:00:38.750> anyway<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.860> opinion<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.220> think<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
earlier anyway in my opinion I think the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
earlier anyway in my opinion I think the
trailer<00:00:41.850> everything<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.510> good<00:00:42.690> he's<00:00:43.050> shown<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
trailer everything was good he's shown a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.380 
trailer everything was good he's shown a
few<00:00:43.739> new<00:00:44.010> scenes<00:00:44.339> I<00:00:44.550> haven't<00:00:44.820> seen<00:00:44.910> yet<00:00:45.150> but

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
few new scenes I haven't seen yet but

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
few new scenes I haven't seen yet but
I'm<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.660> too<00:00:45.989> fussed<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.770> he

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I'm not too fussed about because he

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.299 
I'm not too fussed about because he
didn't<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.280> spoil<00:00:47.550> anything<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.090> much

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
didn't really spoil anything that much

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.380 
didn't really spoil anything that much
one<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> does<00:00:50.790> bother<00:00:50.969> me<00:00:51.090> though<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
one thing that does bother me though is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.279 
one thing that does bother me though is
that<00:00:51.420> they've<00:00:51.629> been<00:00:51.780> showing<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that they've been showing a lot of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
that they've been showing a lot of
spider-man<00:00:52.739> web<00:00:53.039> swinging<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.700> going

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
spider-man web swinging and that's going

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
spider-man web swinging and that's going
to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> best<00:00:54.239> part<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.660> 3d<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to be the best part in 3d when you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.330 
to be the best part in 3d when you
actually<00:00:55.440> bought<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> movies<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> watch

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it so I'm kind of that's my only

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
it so I'm kind of that's my only
complaint<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.309> they've<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.730> showing<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
complaint is that they've been showing a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
complaint is that they've been showing a
bit<00:01:00.149> too<00:01:00.360> much<00:01:00.570> web<00:01:01.260> slinging<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.129> yeah

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
bright web shua it causes some kind of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.290 
bright web shua it causes some kind of
new<00:01:15.869> web<00:01:16.229> feature<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> two<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:18.209> the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
new web feature which is two for the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.359 
new web feature which is two for the
Webster<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:19.050> separate<00:01:19.410> ways<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.890> cause

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
Webster go two separate ways and cause

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.400 
Webster go two separate ways and cause
some<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.789> of<00:01:20.970> net<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.569> catch<00:01:21.720> heavy<00:01:21.990> objects

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
some kind of net to catch heavy objects

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.919 
some kind of net to catch heavy objects
off<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.220> light<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.729> opinion<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.209> swing<00:01:24.630> shot

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
off the light in my opinion a swing shot

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.419 
off the light in my opinion a swing shot
that<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.289> probably<00:01:25.470> launch<00:01:25.830> spider-man

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
that can probably launch spider-man

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.660 
that can probably launch spider-man
stuff<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.849> that<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:28.250> this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.459> really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
stuff like that and this is really

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
stuff like that and this is really
interesting<00:01:29.849> because<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.840> only<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.170> he<00:01:31.200> got

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
interesting because not only has he got

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.050 
interesting because not only has he got
new<00:01:31.590> web<00:01:31.770> shooters<00:01:32.099> bought<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.459> actually<00:01:32.940> do

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
new web shooters bought the actually do

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960 
new web shooters bought the actually do
different<00:01:33.450> things<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.840> well<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.399> yeah<00:01:35.399> also

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
different things as well and yeah also

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.419 
different things as well and yeah also
one<00:01:36.810> thing<00:01:36.929> I'd<00:01:37.050> like<00:01:37.080> spy-eyes<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> don't

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
one thing I'd like spy-eyes up I don't

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.219 
one thing I'd like spy-eyes up I don't
think<00:01:38.550> like<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.569> movie<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.899> know<00:01:40.050> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
think like in the movie we know that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
think like in the movie we know that
spider-man<00:01:40.590> upgrades<00:01:41.160> these<00:01:41.369> web<00:01:41.759> shooters

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
spider-man upgrades these web shooters

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
spider-man upgrades these web shooters
so<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.959> their<00:01:43.170> electro<00:01:43.619> proof<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.160> don't

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so that like their electro proof I don't

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.279 
so that like their electro proof I don't
think<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.239> them<00:01:45.539> I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.050> these<00:01:46.229> are

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
think these are them I think these are

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.620 
think these are them I think these are
the<00:01:46.770> reason<00:01:47.489> why<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.819> grades<00:01:48.179> them<00:01:48.390> because

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the reason why your grades them because

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.100 
the reason why your grades them because
electro<00:01:48.959> keep<00:01:49.140> breaking<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.709> so<00:01:50.250> yeah<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:51.450> lot

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
electro keep breaking them so yeah a lot

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.669 
electro keep breaking them so yeah a lot
