00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.479 
a turd bit here so when you pop it into
the<00:02:49.640> guitar<00:02:53.200> there's<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.260> point<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:55.310> sort

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the guitar there's a point you like sort

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.479 
the guitar there's a point you like sort
of<00:02:55.519> pops<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:55.910> then<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> screw<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:58.370> like<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
of pops in then you screw there's like a

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.370 
of pops in then you screw there's like a
thread<00:02:58.970> there<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.390> then<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.810> in<00:02:59.989> half<00:03:00.200> you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
thread there and then it's in half you

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.449 
thread there and then it's in half you
know<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.910> uh<00:03:02.799> yeah<00:03:03.799> there's<00:03:04.100> multiple<00:03:04.430> ways

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
know but uh yeah there's multiple ways

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.960 
know but uh yeah there's multiple ways
that<00:03:04.579> those<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.150> these<00:03:05.810> things<00:03:05.989> can<00:03:06.200> lock<00:03:06.410> in

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
that those that these things can lock in

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.830 
that those that these things can lock in
so<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> guess<00:03:08.209> this<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.420> kind<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.720> an

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
so I guess this is kind of an

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.770 
so I guess this is kind of an
all-purpose<00:03:09.140> one<00:03:10.359> designed<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.450> fit<00:03:11.600> any
