00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
it came with the crop top and it's also

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.289 
it came with the crop top and it's also
got<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.100> basic<00:03:40.310> black<00:03:40.670> singlet<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.239> I

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
got just a basic black singlet and I

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.539 
got just a basic black singlet and I
needed<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.630> basic<00:03:41.959> black<00:03:42.440> singlet<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.400> actually

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
needed a basic black singlet so actually

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.060 
needed a basic black singlet so actually
going<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.269> detach<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:45.320> two<00:03:45.560> tops<00:03:45.799> and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
going to just detach the two tops and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.789 
going to just detach the two tops and
then<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:46.850> i<00:03:46.880> can<00:03:47.060> wear<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.269> one<00:03:48.049> over<00:03:48.410> just

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
then so i can wear that one over just

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.440 
then so i can wear that one over just
like<00:03:48.859> any<00:03:49.040> tops<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.430> i<00:03:49.519> want<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:49.970> then<00:03:50.390> i

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
like any tops that i want it and then i

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.449 
like any tops that i want it and then i
can<00:03:50.630> run<00:03:50.810> with<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.109> just<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:52.100> summer

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.490 
can run with it just like that in summer
and<00:03:52.730> then<00:03:53.480> i<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.810> also<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.380> black

winter<00:06:37.490> winter<00:06:37.729> so<00:06:38.389> that's<00:06:38.539> why<00:06:38.660> we<00:06:38.810> have<00:06:38.930> to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
winter winter so that's why we have to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.100 
winter winter so that's why we have to
do<00:06:39.110> winter<00:06:39.760> but<00:06:40.760> I<00:06:40.820> mean<00:06:41.060> so<00:06:41.389> that's<00:06:41.570> it<00:06:41.810> um

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110

it's<00:06:42.919> not<00:06:43.070> too<00:06:43.250> long<00:06:43.400> so<00:06:43.789> i<00:06:43.820> guess<00:06:44.080> anyway<00:06:45.080> that

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
it's not too long so i guess anyway that

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.230 
it's not too long so i guess anyway that
was<00:06:45.560> today<00:06:45.979> and<00:06:46.190> then<00:06:46.340> um<00:06:46.460> i<00:06:46.729> noticed<00:06:47.150> i

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
was today and then um i noticed i

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.689
