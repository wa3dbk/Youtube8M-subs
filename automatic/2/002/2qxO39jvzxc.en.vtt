00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.279
 what data tie the film 3 but today 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.880
 we come that the information of the new 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.520
 battlefield 4 as you know or if not what 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.960
 you knew today a gameplay has come out that 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.360
 why has put the title you have 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.420
 first of all you have the gameplay that is 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 about the battlefield 4 campaign in the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.059
 description are 17 17 39 seconds of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 game among which includes the and 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.280
 between all of us and that we are left with some 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.690
 17 minutes of the game in those 17 minutes 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 of games cuts us the campaign to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.650
 several times that is to say it is the same 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 chapter but cut it to prevent 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.469
 a whole chapter is runaway 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.760
 I do not want to take anything out of the gameplay but 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.680
 I already say that the description and well what 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
 I'm watching is a time debate filtres 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 since upload time 24m single 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.259
 would show a great copyright of the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.259
 big 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.380
 things to say today if images appear 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.480
 on the screen because everything is always 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.600
 seeing now that is used to do 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.870
 the len wein of the bikes but good 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 that one that had around there and is used the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.850
 question 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.220
 we see different things in the gameplay 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 On the one hand we see a weapon 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.720
 what we see clearly is one thing that is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 that the enemies do not know why 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 be Chinese because it's about being 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.840
 speaking in Chinese and everything you want 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.580
 the enemies without having same suit 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.060
 that we see here we are shooting them 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.220
 costume now do not know why but 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:00.580
 good they are Chinese they speak but we want 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:04.630
 a 4-1-4-1 weapon 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.630
 basically start 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.460
 I think it is 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.650
 then we have this so weird are you 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.090
 seeing and is that we can dock a 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.380
 peephole peephole of the black ops 2 that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.360
 you can change it to the average mode 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.620
 we are going to apply it but to the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 right so that the turning we have 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 the gun to shoot 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.270
 I do not know what that is, it's like a double 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.460
 peephole for zones when a house 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.020
 and the truth is quite interesting but 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.620
 if you put them next time as it is rare 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.879
 you can see also 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.459
 we will see new new weapons good weapons 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.750
 that were already a gasteiz watching the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.270
 second weapon that was wearing that was a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.790
 shotgun 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.079
 it is complete that it seems that it is the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.840
 the m 1 091 or something like that the truth and 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.299
 you have the next picture and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 then we have the typical grenade launcher 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.040
 of battlefield there is typical of black ops 2 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.069
 because they are grenade launchers 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.520
 they will be on streak stay grenades 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.130
 it also comes and uses it several times 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.100
 It also looks like destroying things 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.600
 that you wanted also say that it is 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.500
 all moved by the new frostbite engine 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.150
 3 the toilet frostbite 2 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.440
 has not been confirmed yet because in the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.910
 nothing has come gameplay 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.740
 so you really do not know but the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.030
 physical continues to have improved have improved 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.240
 a little 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.150
 and the truth is interesting good more 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.160
 vehicles we go for the vehicles of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.600
 vehicles and we have that one here that is 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.670
 the helicopter when you came to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.800
 rescue from the gameplay is only plan 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.260
 normal or the cargo butler a 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.850
 helicopter that is in battlefield 3 and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.760
 then we have the enemy doctor who is 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.319
 a contradict in addition to fil 3 and is a 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.140
 Turnip do not know if I never remember 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.520
 the folios names or as you will see 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.660
 is the attack helicopter the 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.450
 attack helicopter 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.139
 the one that does not serve the other the one 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:21.530
 missile launchers 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.909
 where we do not know if it will be a vehicle 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.650
 can be used in multiplayer or not 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.949
 it's the vehicle they use to escape 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.270
 which is a normal ranchera of a civil 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.999
 which also does not enter the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.849
 asks with the rumor that they are going to 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:39.150
 include civilians which I see very very 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.400
 very unlikely in the multiplayer 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.699
 include civilians 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.590
 but civilian cars and almost goat already 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.960
 maybe we go to a parking there in 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.759
 instead of having them all broken because 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.120
 we would have a civilian car like a wax 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.350
 like normal cars that even 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.389
 we can remove the roof from above and 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.160
 shoot the this is speculation but 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.520
 we go in car that escape are cars 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.520
 civilians 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.800
 for now the gameplay has not been given 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.800
 more more news 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.470
 hello guys I'm the voiceover good 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.500
 before saying anything I forgot to put 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.250
 a vehicle is the typical buggy that 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.360
 we found in almost all the maps a 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.009
 buggy type of battlefield 3 also 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.940
 battlefield 4 will be made with the same 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.039
 weapons all the same 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.630
 attending we're going to see a lot of change the 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.810
 main gun I think it was an m16 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.780
 to 1 game like that I already say without knowing 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.910
 really how is it and that's all good 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.220
 we follow 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.890
 has come out at the end of the gameplay the face 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.960
 of the woman in the photograph 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.100
 what's on the battlefield page what 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.470
 that there was before because they have changed 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.500
 and also one news is that if you 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.390
 reserves and stops entering the beta of 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.670
 battlefield 4 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.720
 for any console they will be vice 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.420
 they sing the drums in the beta of 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.860
 battlefield 4 and also the tan one 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.320
 improvement in game is to say an improvement 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.230
 inside the game later on weapons that 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.730
 it can be a dlc I do not know but what it does 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.740
 that is coming is not like the last time 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.120
 came the dlc back to load highlights that 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.420
 already taught a dlc that he gave to swim 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.470
 moment they have said nothing 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.860
 the truth of the beta date I do not 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.230
 I know they say they even know already 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.080
 I find an entry but I do not know 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.800
 when is it then because it seems to me that 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.200
 it's late May but basically 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.240
 that's all from the gameplay taught from 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.830
 battlefield 4 also taught some 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.930
 images that I will put them in the 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.270
 description about three images that 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.600
 they left that is from the video at 33 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.090
 images the graphic engine the truth has 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.450
 improved has improved is not what 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.280
 I was really hoping I was not expecting 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.810
 mate the fill 4 he hoped he did not get it 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.510
 very futuristic and remains the same 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.790
 game the same 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.169
 simply against the Chinese the taste 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.259
 strange 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.210
 but is that several times they also say 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.350
 against the Russians so I'm going to be 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.780
 also double story type 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.650
 with 17 minutes they do not give you much to 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.840
 speculate but good 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.210
 a little more you know from the 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.650
 description you have the images that 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.560
 they came out revealed in the building 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.539
 all also all things to be 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.539
 putting in images that you have been putting 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.340
 above and well I consulted if 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.319
 I have more profile information 4 I'm going to 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.759
 go through here I'll put it because

 I literally transmitted twitter to 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.939
 when things happen from these always 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.139
 I'm for 110,000 puppet in the 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:40.000
 description and that I put the same in the 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:42.819
