00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.290
 press with friends my name is in affairs and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.300
 see the projection of the world and today we 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.240
 talking about news changes which 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 occurred in toys art online 1 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 There was a mini map in the game now in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.750
 top right you can see and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.230
 navigate the terrain thanks 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.760
 this is a very nice useful feature 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 the following developers told us 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.400
 described a very early version with their 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 look at the system once in the game and this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.079
 very interesting in terms of rpp as 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 for me because under different styles of play 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.340
 you can choose different times that is not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 everyone is equal and everyone chooses what he is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 more close too what is more to him 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.800
 like let's say 1 of 1 will have 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.469
 more inventory ie those people 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.840
 someone who likes to build something or 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
 carry things anyway you can 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 hammer it in a huge amount of blocks and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 go build you have the rest 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.879
 run from chest to chest 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.329
 another race will get a speed bonus 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 digging for the extraction of ore resources and also 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.080
 bonuses from this ore will only be possible 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.570
 more there fall out of these rarest 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 resources or they will often fall without 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.970
 It is suitable for those who like to poke around. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 the tunnels 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.920
 there in the caves to visit my 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.580
 it's very cool I probably even having 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 I will play next time and this time 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 researchers that is suitable for those 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.030
 who likes to just run around the world 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.560
 advise this is a corner of this very world 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.730
 because they will be speed bonuses 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.790
 movement 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.270
 as well as the beauty of jumping here on this 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.400
 proper 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.290
 the developers don't tell us anything yet 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 additionally but as I said it 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.980
 very early look at the system once 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 in the game in the future he will soon 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.480
 just more and more bonuses will still 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 more individual are unique and each 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.250
 every player who wants something for himself 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.040
 choose your style and taste and there 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.600
 instead in the world of art online this is not with 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.860
