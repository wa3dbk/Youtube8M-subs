00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.250
 in this lesson we will learn 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 transfer 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.349
 This ebay site from English to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.160
 Russian 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:17.360
 so let's go for another service 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.360
 aliexpress portal rather 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.360
 selling various goods 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.880
 here and let's say let's go 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.880
 some goods this one 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.930
 so here we have everything in English 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.050
 let's say we want to translate this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 the sentence we copy it we go in 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 Google translator 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 translate site. google.com insert 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.610
 here first we have to define here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 language you definitely can automatically 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.690
 also select these languages ​​English with 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.820
 English to Russian 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.200
 minus this translator is that he is not 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.860
 translates into one hundred percent meaning he 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.810
 translates brings meaning but translation 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.220
 read poorly well for example maybe not 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 be delivered to Kazakhstan read description 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 item or contact seller 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.659
 more here more less here more 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.009
 more or less 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.600
 something translated so there are a bunch of words 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.880
 i.e. google is a robot so he 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.369
 exactly the meaning will not translate but 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 this is enough to understand the meaning 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.800
 so and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.800
 let's look at another example 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.440
 how can we do differently we 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.360
 copied now with you website either and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.330
 dot com 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.850
 so this is what we insert here now 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.369
 we will appear if the site does not appear 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.830
 we click to translate 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.170
 just click here and we can 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 via google translator to watch this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.790
 the site will translate everything to us 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.650
 automatically that is, we see fashion 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 electronics house garden 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.020
 cycling collecting 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
 let's choose some product 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.970
 there let's say a laptop we only see 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.540
 Today this is a proposal that is 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.760
 probably for the action that's something he 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.319
 translates exactly something not exactly 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.069
 here and so we can view this 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.579
 site to go somewhere here but he 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.560
 it happens still so for example we 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.390
 we can go here by this link but 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.260
 we click it is not pressed not 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.269
 goes over that is a minus of it 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.730
 the translator is that here we are 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.930
 You can look for problems in English 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.389
 any goods 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.889
 and then just this lot 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.989
 copy-paste 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.260
 translator and he will translate to us completely 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.500
 page as for aliexpress here 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.629
 the same thing he translates to us only 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.569
 main page but if we go 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.909
 somewhere here u will have everything on 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.909
 English is how you see 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.920
 here 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.100
 I personally use it so many 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.010
 offer various plugins plugins for 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.170
 mozilla browser here's for opera for 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.910
 Internet to the dispute then what it uses 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.500
 there are special plugins that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.020
 the browser itself is installed 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.940
 that is, you do not need to go to google 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.890
 then copy something paste something 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.650
 you already have English automatically 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.510
 sites will be translated 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.370
 if you want to install such a plugin 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.250
 so without hemorrhoids here and so all 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.200
 copy and paste then look 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.700
 search engine 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.480
 Here, but I basically do not like it 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.790
 enjoy before or not do this look 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.800
 In principle, I can not do it all 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.340
 I do n’t even look in English 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.500
 I do not understand the main thing about the product itself and the price 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.990
 then if I am interested in the description 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 I'm starting to copy paste 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.320
 translate understand some sense as well 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.790
 you need a google translator when 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.820
 you will communicate with the seller 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.830
 any item you want 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.480
 ask him some question you first 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.480
 write in Russian 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.200
 here 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.010
 choose and Russian here English write 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.020
 all the signs how are you and so on and so forth 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.790
 that kinda that is you copy it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.310
 everything is already from here that the front to 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.650
 English paste him and he, too, by 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.900
 I understand the meaning of you 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.890
 communication is that is you do not need 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.230
 know english you take type ip 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.420
 he translates a person already sees what 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.320
 in question 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.090
 even if he did not understand 20-30 percent 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.890
 your presentation he does not care 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:39.240
 guess what it is 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.310
 here's the interesting thing is he say 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.670
 any goods are that on and would not 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.270
 sent to Kazakhstan or Russia 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.670
 you will need to contact the seller 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.170
 says that so and so dear 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.960
 Please send no goods to Russia 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.510
 How much will it cost? 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.060
 You will send the service, that is, you will have to 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.480
 negotiate or you will have 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.610
 some questions about the product 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.380
 something you well there are different goods then 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.560
 there are questions can 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.420
 arise seller here you can 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.880
 ask how it all works a little 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.930
 later for now don't bother well 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.930
 on this principle everything
