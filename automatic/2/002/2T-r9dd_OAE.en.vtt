compared<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.040> fumari<00:01:16.610> or<00:01:17.049> Fantasia<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.860> two

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.310 
tobacco's I usually smoke it's just not
as<00:01:22.280> juicy<00:01:22.580> as<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.939> other<00:01:23.090> ones<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.600> resulting

as juicy as the other ones and resulting
that<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.799> think<00:01:25.759> it's<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.909> lack<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.090> flavor<00:01:26.479> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
that I think it's a lack of flavor and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.770 
that I think it's a lack of flavor and
it<00:01:26.960> burns<00:01:27.200> faster<00:01:27.710> um<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.390> smoke<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.540> like<00:01:29.750> a
