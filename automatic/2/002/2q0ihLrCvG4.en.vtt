in<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.709> room<00:02:34.180> pushing<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> bike<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.810> very

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
in the room pushing the bike is very

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.160 
in the room pushing the bike is very
safe<00:02:36.530> pushing<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.520> run<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.970> not<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:39.020> way<00:02:39.140> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
safe pushing the run is not the way I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.210 
safe pushing the run is not the way I
want<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> think<00:02:39.680> about<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.100> difference

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
want you to think about the difference

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.640 
want you to think about the difference
between<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.730> two<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.690> run<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.530> are

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
between the two is on the run you are

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.740 
between the two is on the run you are
constantly<00:02:43.280> turning<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> dial<00:02:43.970> up<00:02:44.239> see<00:02:44.630> what

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
constantly turning the dial up see what

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.420 
constantly turning the dial up see what
you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:44.900> do<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.900> was<00:02:48.020> totally<00:02:48.290> wrong<00:02:48.440> though

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
you can do that was totally wrong though

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.070 
you can do that was totally wrong though

if I can edit it alright if I can't edit

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.949 
if I can edit it alright if I can't edit
it<00:02:52.610> then<00:02:52.640> what<00:02:52.940> does<00:02:53.030> compute<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.780> will<00:02:53.870> go

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
it then what does compute it will go

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.500 
it then what does compute it will go
back<00:02:54.670> here's<00:02:55.670> how<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:55.850> want<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.180> do<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.390> on

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510

the bike you're constantly turning the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
the bike you're constantly turning the
dial<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.870> test<00:03:00.140> your<00:03:00.350> fitness<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.830> see

at the end you go back and see what you
did<00:03:07.730> ok<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:09.290> on<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.130> bike<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:11.180> are<00:03:11.360> working

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
did ok so on the bike we are working

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.800 
did ok so on the bike we are working
harder<00:03:12.769> every<00:03:13.340> day<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.420> have<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.600> power

harder every day so if you have a power

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.000 
harder every day so if you have a power
meter<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.380> know<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.800> today's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
meter and you know that today's

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.979 
meter and you know that today's
intervals<00:03:16.459> are<00:03:16.580> supposed<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:17.000> at<00:03:17.120> 220

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
intervals are supposed to be at 220

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.030 
the first two minutes get its rate
minute<00:04:49.060> pace<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.480> then<00:04:50.050> stop<00:04:50.590> looking<00:04:50.620> at

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
minute pace and then stop looking at

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.760 
minute pace and then stop looking at
your<00:04:51.160> watch<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:52.570> start<00:04:52.810> running<00:04:52.960> at<00:04:53.290> that

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
your watch just start running at that

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.710 
your watch just start running at that
point<00:04:53.980> I'm<00:04:54.160> how<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.400> feel<00:04:54.670> if<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.300> feel<00:04:55.420> good

in<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:55.930> little<00:04:56.170> section<00:04:56.320> it<00:04:56.620> picks<00:04:56.830> up<00:04:56.920> a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
in this little section it picks up a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.080 
in this little section it picks up a
little<00:04:57.190> bit<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.400> you're<00:04:57.520> not<00:04:57.610> feeling<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:57.970> good

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
little bit if you're not feeling so good

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
little bit if you're not feeling so good
it<00:04:58.210> slows<00:04:58.360> down<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.570> little<00:04:58.660> bit<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.050> then

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
it slows down a little bit and then

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.470 
it slows down a little bit and then
after<00:05:00.040> six<00:05:00.370> more<00:05:00.580> minutes<00:05:00.730> or<00:05:01.090> when<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.330> watch

and<00:05:06.700> look<00:05:06.820> at<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.060> time<00:05:07.240> okay<00:05:07.930> because<00:05:08.350> that

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
and look at the time okay because that

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.420 
and look at the time okay because that

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
the end of that run surprised okay but

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.610 
the end of that run surprised okay but
you're<00:05:52.240> always<00:05:52.630> running<00:05:52.870> within<00:05:53.140> yourself

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
you're always running within yourself

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.440

because what happens is people chase the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.640 
because what happens is people chase the
number<00:05:55.690> on<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:55.810> watch<00:05:56.050> they<00:05:56.440> throw

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
number on the watch they throw

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.770 
number on the watch they throw
everything<00:05:56.920> else<00:05:57.160> that<00:05:57.400> I<00:05:57.610> want<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.420> to<00:05:58.540> chase

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
that feeling of what it means to run

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.120 
that feeling of what it means to run
really<00:06:00.220> well<00:06:00.600> sustainably<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.870> fast<00:06:02.560> just

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
really well sustainably and fast just

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.230

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
like you did in the first interval but

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.240 
like you did in the first interval but
maybe<00:06:04.450> you<00:06:04.810> know<00:06:04.870> one<00:06:05.290> degree<00:06:05.710> 2<00:06:05.950> degrees

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
maybe you know one degree 2 degrees

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.490 
maybe you know one degree 2 degrees
better<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:06.760> then<00:06:07.390> go<00:06:07.510> back<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:07.930> confirm<00:06:08.080> that

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
better and then go back and confirm that
