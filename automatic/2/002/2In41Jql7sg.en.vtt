 efe a very important activity in the region 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 in this season 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.890

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.280
 soon I invite you to listen to the professor faustino elmos who will tell us 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.460
 a bit of history about the origins of the municipality the importance of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 railway in the economic development in palmira 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.890
 you talk to him 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 well we know we find the seat of the entity 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 in him what is the splice symbol of what is the story of splicing 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 in that place that is the museum we represent us 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.090
 for the splicing people because they were part of their history 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.740
 that story that he forged 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.780
 to this city to this town to these people who came from different 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.509
 parts of the country and they always settled together with their families in this place 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 We're seeing 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.600
 by the way is what counts 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.550
 the mainly railroad activity 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.840
 although in splicing 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.580
 we have here on our backs a replica of the steam locomotive 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 of those that were used mainly when the beginnings of the railroad 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.930
 we are calling the sonora railway 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 that later passes the railroad its pacific of mexico 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.320
 possibly railroads of the pacific and national railroads of mexico 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.380
 what we are seeing here 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.020
 is something very valuable to the story of splicing x is a symbol is a the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.790
 liquigÃ¡s 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.439
 of our history 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:15.489
 because you are not represented more than anything percent in your walk your use of 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.280
 him on the island 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.539
 life itself 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.019
 from the town of splice 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.949
 each and every one of the pieces that we have here 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.489
 in sample 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.170
 Well, yes it gives us an idea I saw that it was what our grandparents our parents 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.629
 they carry him out in his work 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.090
 inside the railroad while the workshops or on the freight trains 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.639
 or passengers 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.159
 talking about splicing 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.209
 because always always definitely if we are going to have the liver to 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.319
 railway 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.029
 there is 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:52.399
 that was built to those who locked in our territory from 1905 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.310
 and that gave him life that gave him 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 after birth 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.329
 initially 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.790
 as there was in the city of porec the union as it was called Jose Sancho 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.179
 in English and subsequently 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.289
 per second a man that the same workers 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.599
 empalmenses and the toruÃ±os put it 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 this after the sample 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.399
 beloki percent 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.069
 in our history 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.369
 It represents 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:21.719
 affection 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.839
 willpower 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 and, above all, in the 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.069
 the essential point 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.029
 of the economy that was always linked 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.189
 to the development of our junction 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.019
 this is 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.079
 railway life instruments 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.639
 who the workers themselves 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.039
 3 had lie in daily life as in their daily work 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.159
 in these you must 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.469
 here 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.529
 in which splice issue this fund was created 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:57.879
 thanks to this that we are seeing here thanks to the railroad from 1905 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.039
 returning to sound that waits 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.939
 if we get the economic activity of the region gives the impression of start 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:08.379
 and james
