00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
mid weight fleece such as this might

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.170 
mid weight fleece such as this might
just<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> ticket<00:01:25.710> we'll<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> test<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just be the ticket we'll have to test it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.260 
just be the ticket we'll have to test it
out<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.229> weight<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> liner<00:01:28.890> is

1.4<00:01:30.270> pounds<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.310> average<00:01:32.850> individual

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
1.4 pounds so for the average individual

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
1.4 pounds so for the average individual
that's<00:01:33.689> lighter<00:01:34.020> than<00:01:34.140> their<00:01:34.409> sleeping<00:01:34.860> bag
