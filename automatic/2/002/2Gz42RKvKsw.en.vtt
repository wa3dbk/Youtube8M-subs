disgusting you really are disgusting so
yeah<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> question<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.439> what's<00:02:04.770> towards<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
yeah the question is what's towards the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.590 
yeah the question is what's towards the
scariest<00:02:05.640> moment<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.030> whole<00:02:06.180> entire<00:02:06.240> life

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and um probably the scariest moment

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.820 
and um probably the scariest moment

skimboarding all that stuff in the ocean

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.690 
skimboarding all that stuff in the ocean
but<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.410> day<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.620> was<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:28.250> really<00:02:28.430> rough

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
but one day it was really really rough

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.260 
but one day it was really really rough
with<00:02:29.300> huge<00:02:29.600> waves<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.940> decided<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.030> want<00:02:32.180> to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
with huge waves and I decided I want to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.300 
with huge waves and I decided I want to
go<00:02:32.330> out<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.540> boogie<00:02:32.810> board<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.410> I'm<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.040> pumped

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
go out and boogie board so I'm so pumped

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.160 
go out and boogie board so I'm so pumped
just<00:02:34.730> cuz<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.970> ways<00:02:35.090> are<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.420> huge<00:02:35.630> but<00:02:35.990> um

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
just cuz the ways are so huge but um

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.290 
just cuz the ways are so huge but um
apparently<00:02:36.830> from<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> shore<00:02:37.580> they<00:02:37.790> look<00:02:38.030> big

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
apparently from the shore they look big

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.610 
apparently from the shore they look big
but<00:02:38.570> when<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:38.960> out<00:02:39.080> there<00:02:39.260> they're<00:02:39.380> even

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
but when you get out there they're even

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.940 
but when you get out there they're even
bigger<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.480> apparently<00:02:41.720> only<00:02:42.500> boogie

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
bigger so apparently only boogie

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.680 
bigger so apparently only boogie
boarders<00:02:43.280> were<00:02:43.460> on<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> water<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.150> surfers

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
boarders were on the water and surfers

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.960 
boarders were on the water and surfers
but<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.380> had<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.740> have<00:02:45.860> fins<00:02:46.190> on<00:02:46.490> your<00:02:46.700> feet

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
but you had to have fins on your feet

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.750 
but you had to have fins on your feet
just<00:02:47.450> because<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.260> fins<00:02:49.010> help<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.370> swim<00:02:49.550> so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
just because I fins help you swim so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.699 
just because I fins help you swim so
much<00:02:49.910> better<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.300> ocean<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.900> just

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
much better in the ocean and just

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.810 
much better in the ocean and just
because<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.920> current<00:02:52.160> was<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.459> strong<00:02:52.490> that

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
because the current was so strong that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.090 
because the current was so strong that
day<00:02:53.150> um<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:54.170> need<00:02:54.290> fins<00:02:54.560> or<00:02:54.770> else<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.010> could

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
day um you need fins or else you could

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.910 
day um you need fins or else you could
probably<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.459> taken<00:02:55.670> out<00:02:55.730> easily<00:02:55.970> well<00:02:56.840> uh<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
probably get taken out easily well uh I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.210 
probably get taken out easily well uh I
wasn't<00:02:58.580> informed<00:02:58.700> about<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.870> fins<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:00.980> just

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
wasn't informed about the fins so I just

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.130 
wasn't informed about the fins so I just
started<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.180> there<00:03:02.420> paddling<00:03:02.750> out

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
started going out there paddling out

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.610 
started going out there paddling out
like<00:03:03.410> crazy<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.010> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.870> oceans<00:03:06.170> charge<00:03:06.440> is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
like crazy and on the oceans charge is

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.140 
like crazy and on the oceans charge is
taking<00:03:06.980> me<00:03:07.070> farther<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.520> farther<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
taking me farther and farther and the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940 
taking me farther and farther and the
waves<00:03:08.390> are<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.440> well<00:03:09.620> first<00:03:09.860> of

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
waves are just with you well first of

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
waves are just with you well first of
all<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.040> have<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.250> go<00:03:10.340> off<00:03:10.430> bar<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:10.940> I

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
all I have to go off bar because I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.520 
all I have to go off bar because I
didn't<00:03:11.180> want<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.360> get<00:03:11.450> crashed<00:03:11.750> bomb<00:03:11.990> by<00:03:12.500> a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
didn't want to get crashed bomb by a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.710 
didn't want to get crashed bomb by a
wave<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.190> I'm<00:03:13.400> before<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.390> started

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
wave but I'm before I just started

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.360 
wave but I'm before I just started
taking<00:03:15.020> about<00:03:15.140> me<00:03:15.620> off<00:03:15.740> farther<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.160> farther

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
taking about me off farther and farther

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.830 
taking about me off farther and farther
and<00:03:16.640> I<00:03:16.730> started<00:03:17.180> paddling<00:03:17.360> back<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.690> shore

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
and I started paddling back to shore

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.050 
and I started paddling back to shore
just<00:03:18.200> because<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.800> want<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.340> catch<00:03:19.580> a<00:03:19.730> wave<00:03:19.910> and

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
just because I want to catch a wave and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.550 
just because I want to catch a wave and
now<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.390> taking<00:03:20.660> me<00:03:20.750> out<00:03:20.840> too<00:03:21.080> far<00:03:21.320> and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
now this is taking me out too far and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.370 
now this is taking me out too far and
eventually<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.489> found<00:03:22.850> myself<00:03:23.269> past<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.110> the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
eventually I found myself past all the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.830 
eventually I found myself past all the
other<00:03:24.500> boogie<00:03:24.769> boarders<00:03:25.130> all<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.640> them<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.000> I
