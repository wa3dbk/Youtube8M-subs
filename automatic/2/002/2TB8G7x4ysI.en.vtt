character animation done in Maya the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.779 
character animation done in Maya the
difficulty<00:00:20.289> of<00:00:20.320> this<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.800> trying<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.280> take<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
difficulty of this is trying to take the

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.420 
difficulty of this is trying to take the
camera<00:00:22.300> moves<00:00:22.450> that<00:00:22.630> we<00:00:22.750> have<00:00:22.990> built<00:00:23.530> in<00:00:23.770> After

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
camera moves that we have built in After

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.460 
camera moves that we have built in After
Effects<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:24.880> time<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:25.720> with<00:00:25.930> character

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
Effects and time it with character

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.250 
Effects and time it with character
animation<00:00:27.010> so<00:00:27.369> I<00:00:27.610> tried<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.240> couple<00:00:28.270> of<00:00:28.600> methods

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
animation so I tried a couple of methods

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.349 
animation so I tried a couple of methods
and<00:00:29.710> what<00:00:29.920> I<00:00:29.949> found<00:00:30.279> so<00:00:30.640> far<00:00:30.850> seems<00:00:31.150> to<00:00:31.270> be

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
and what I found so far seems to be

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.360 
and what I found so far seems to be
working<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> best<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:32.289> I<00:00:32.590> rendered<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.980> draft

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
working the best is I rendered a draft

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.490 
working the best is I rendered a draft
video<00:00:33.879> of<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.239> whole<00:00:34.420> scene<00:00:34.720> really

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
video of the whole scene really

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.080 
video of the whole scene really
low-quality<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:36.610> can<00:00:36.730> see<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:36.910> know<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
low-quality you can see you know the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.430 
low-quality you can see you know the
plants<00:00:37.420> are<00:00:37.510> moving<00:00:37.810> and<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.020> lighting<00:00:38.350> has

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
plants are moving and the lighting has

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.410 
plants are moving and the lighting has
these<00:00:38.560> big<00:00:38.739> square<00:00:39.100> chunks<00:00:39.430> on<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:39.820> rendered

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
these big square chunks on it I rendered

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.270 
these big square chunks on it I rendered
that<00:00:40.570> out<00:00:40.840> just<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.290> get<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.470> sense<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
that out just to get a sense of the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.400 
that out just to get a sense of the
camera<00:00:43.000> move<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.480> timing<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:43.989> then<00:00:44.140> I

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
camera move and the timing and then I

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.260 
camera move and the timing and then I
went<00:00:44.829> through<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.130> just<00:00:45.399> started<00:00:45.700> drawing<00:00:46.030> on

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
went through and just started drawing on

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.270 
went through and just started drawing on
top<00:00:46.329> of<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.899> footage<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.469> Photoshop<00:00:48.010> to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
top of the footage in Photoshop to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.090 
top of the footage in Photoshop to
actually<00:00:49.120> lay<00:00:49.750> out<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.050> seals<00:00:50.320> movements<00:00:50.950> and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
actually lay out the seals movements and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.010 
actually lay out the seals movements and
sort<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.309> plan<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.610> scene<00:00:51.969> once<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.570> have<00:00:52.780> the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
sort of plan the scene once I have the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.139 
sort of plan the scene once I have the
animation<00:00:53.500> finished<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.280> can<00:00:54.430> export<00:00:54.790> that<00:00:54.879> and

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
animation finished I can export that and

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.139 
animation finished I can export that and
use<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.930> as<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.050> reference<00:00:56.500> track<00:00:56.770> in<00:00:57.040> Maya<00:00:57.309> to

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
use it as a reference track in Maya to

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.940 
use it as a reference track in Maya to
animate<00:00:58.840> my<00:00:58.989> character<00:00:59.350> -<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.530> could<00:00:59.739> be<00:00:59.829> very

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
animate my character - I could be very

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.529 
animate my character - I could be very
exact<00:01:00.370> with<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.670> or<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.850> could<00:01:01.090> just<00:01:01.270> sort<00:01:01.420> of

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
exact with it or I could just sort of

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.119 
exact with it or I could just sort of
leave<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.870> on<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.079> side<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.500> use<00:01:02.649> it<00:01:02.800> more<00:01:02.980> as

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
leave it on the side and use it more as

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.880 
leave it on the side and use it more as
reference<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.059> not<00:01:04.869> be<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:05.170> exact<00:01:05.560> but<00:01:05.740> just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
reference and not be so exact but just

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.770 
reference and not be so exact but just
worry<00:01:06.190> more<00:01:06.460> about<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.850> broad<00:01:07.060> arcs<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.690> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
worry more about the broad arcs and the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.770 
worry more about the broad arcs and the
timing<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:09.520> I'd<00:01:09.700> say<00:01:09.940> Photoshop<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.720> not

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
timing well I'd say Photoshop is not

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.740 
timing well I'd say Photoshop is not
ideal<00:01:11.229> for<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.220> kind<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.640> work<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.479> nice

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
ideal for this kind of work it is nice

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.359 
ideal for this kind of work it is nice
to<00:01:13.780> have<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.260> as<00:01:14.320> an<00:01:14.470> option<00:01:14.619> especially<00:01:15.310> if

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
to have it as an option especially if

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.980 
to have it as an option especially if
you<00:01:15.490> don't<00:01:15.640> have<00:01:15.909> any<00:01:16.119> other<00:01:16.299> programs<00:01:16.810> that

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
you don't have any other programs that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.840 
you don't have any other programs that
you<00:01:17.110> can<00:01:17.229> use<00:01:17.290> once<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.130> set<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.340> my<00:01:18.430> shortcut

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
you can use once I set up my shortcut

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.340 
you can use once I set up my shortcut
keys<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.299> everything<00:01:19.540> else<00:01:19.689> actually<00:01:19.960> found

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
keys and everything else actually found

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.710 
keys and everything else actually found
it<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.770> process<00:01:20.979> was<00:01:21.460> pretty<00:01:22.030> intuitive<00:01:22.540> and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
it the process was pretty intuitive and

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.359 
it the process was pretty intuitive and
fast<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.530> could<00:01:23.680> work<00:01:23.830> around<00:01:24.070> all<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
fast and you could work around all the

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.340 
fast and you could work around all the
limitations<00:01:24.970> I'll<00:01:25.689> just<00:01:25.990> show<00:01:26.080> you<00:01:26.170> really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
limitations I'll just show you really

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.280 
limitations I'll just show you really
quick<00:01:26.680> what<00:01:27.159> I<00:01:27.189> did<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:28.030> bring<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.080> footage

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
quick what I did to bring in the footage

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.050 
quick what I did to bring in the footage
so<00:01:29.650> it's<00:01:29.830> pretty<00:01:30.070> easy<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:30.700> open

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
so it's pretty easy you can just open

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.320 
so it's pretty easy you can just open
footage<00:01:31.720> straight<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.520> Photoshop<00:01:33.520> let's<00:01:34.150> go

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
footage straight in Photoshop let's go

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.929 
footage straight in Photoshop let's go
to<00:01:34.390> renders<00:01:34.720> here<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.799> shot<00:01:36.369> one

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939

draft<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.720> have<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.840> draft<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.650> I<00:01:38.830> get<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.250> shot

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
draft I have a draft and I get the shot

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.520 
draft I have a draft and I get the shot
got<00:01:39.640> split<00:01:39.909> up<00:01:40.030> into<00:01:40.210> three<00:01:40.479> parts<00:01:40.689> we<00:01:41.409> can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
got split up into three parts we can

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.010 
got split up into three parts we can
just<00:01:41.680> open<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.250> file<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.810> Photoshop<00:01:43.810> just

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
just open the file and Photoshop just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.950 
just open the file and Photoshop just
opens<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.409> as<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.619> movie<00:01:45.369> movie<00:01:45.970> file<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:46.540> at<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
opens it as a movie movie file so at the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620 
opens it as a movie movie file so at the
resolution<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:48.610> now<00:01:49.090> what<00:01:49.329> we<00:01:49.450> have<00:01:49.479> is

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
resolution to it so now what we have is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.719 
resolution to it so now what we have is
give<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.140> clip<00:01:50.380> runs<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.890> end<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.490> can

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
give the clip runs to the end so I can

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.910 
give the clip runs to the end so I can
just<00:01:52.000> add<00:01:52.240> more<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.079> import<00:01:53.439> more<00:01:53.740> I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
just add more I can just import more I

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160 
just add more I can just import more I
think<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.369> go<00:01:54.610> right<00:01:54.790> here<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.780> import

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
think it's go right here and we import

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.740 
think it's go right here and we import
and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.979> next<00:01:57.490> one<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.509> just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
and then of the next one and that just

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.359 
and then of the next one and that just
gets<00:01:58.869> popped<00:01:59.320> right<00:01:59.530> at<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.710> end<00:01:59.829> here<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.100> it

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
gets popped right at the end here so it

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.550 
gets popped right at the end here so it
seamlessly<00:02:00.899> strings<00:02:01.899> them<00:02:02.140> together<00:02:02.290> and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
seamlessly strings them together and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080 
seamlessly strings them together and
then<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.740> also<00:02:02.950> hit<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.310> end<00:02:03.430> here<00:02:03.640> again<00:02:03.909> so

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
then I also hit the end here again so

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090 
then I also hit the end here again so
I'm<00:02:04.180> just<00:02:04.299> gonna<00:02:04.390> add<00:02:04.600> another<00:02:04.840> clip<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.409> then

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
I'm just gonna add another clip and then

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.260 
I'm just gonna add another clip and then
we<00:02:06.189> have<00:02:06.310> shot<00:02:06.520> too<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:06.939> just<00:02:06.970> sort<00:02:07.210> of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
we have shot too and it just sort of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.449 
we have shot too and it just sort of
stitches<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.810> whole<00:02:07.960> thing<00:02:08.200> together<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:08.829> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
stitches the whole thing together so the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.889 
stitches the whole thing together so the
next<00:02:09.640> thing<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.879> had<00:02:09.999> to<00:02:10.029> do<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.419> just<00:02:10.450> create<00:02:10.749> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
next thing I had to do is just create a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.750 
next thing I had to do is just create a
new<00:02:11.139> video<00:02:11.529> layer<00:02:11.919> so<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.159> go<00:02:12.249> down<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.459> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
new video layer so you go down here and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.759 
new video layer so you go down here and
you<00:02:13.150> go<00:02:13.329> to<00:02:13.389> video<00:02:13.659> layers<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.349> go<00:02:14.499> new

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
you go to video layers and you go new

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.400 
you go to video layers and you go new
blank

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
blank

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.950 
blank
there<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.970> need<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.270> find<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:17.750> right

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
there and you need to find this right

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.150 
there and you need to find this right
now<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> video<00:02:18.830> group<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.130> don't

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
now this is in the video group I don't

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.500 
now this is in the video group I don't
want<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.730> video<00:02:20.000> group<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:20.360> just

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
want it in this video group so I'm just

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.240 
want it in this video group so I'm just
gonna<00:02:20.660> pull<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.650> need<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.920> find

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
gonna pull it up and we need to find

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
gonna pull it up and we need to find
where<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.820> clip<00:02:23.030> starts<00:02:23.360> now

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
where the clip starts now

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.410 
where the clip starts now
I<00:02:23.780> wasn't<00:02:24.680> sure<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.060> gonna<00:02:26.180> pull

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
I wasn't sure but so I'm just gonna pull

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.880 
I wasn't sure but so I'm just gonna pull
it<00:02:26.510> back<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:26.960> now<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.650> whole

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
it back here so now I have this whole

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.740 
it back here so now I have this whole
clip<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.400> what<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.240> this<00:02:29.390> layer<00:02:29.630> is

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
clip and what I can do in this layer is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.350 
clip and what I can do in this layer is
I<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.930> actually<00:02:30.050> draw<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:32.060> using

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I can actually draw on it I'm using

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
I can actually draw on it I'm using
whatever<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.780> want<00:02:33.050> now<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.220> problems

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
whatever I want now one of the problems

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.860 
whatever I want now one of the problems
with<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.210> only<00:02:35.330> going<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.540> draw<00:02:35.690> one

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
with it is it's only going to draw one

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.020 
with it is it's only going to draw one
frame<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.350> it's<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> disappear<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
frame and it's going to disappear in the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.660 
frame and it's going to disappear in the
layer<00:02:38.830> sections<00:02:39.830> here<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> video<00:02:40.430> there

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
layer sections here with the video there

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.570 
layer sections here with the video there
you<00:02:40.970> can<00:02:41.710> duplicate<00:02:42.710> frames<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.430> can

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
you can duplicate frames and you can

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.540 
you can duplicate frames and you can
delete<00:02:43.790> frames<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.620> insert<00:02:46.160> blank

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
delete frames and you can insert blank

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.890 
delete frames and you can insert blank
frames<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.240> these<00:02:47.330> are<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> three<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.870> I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
frames and these are the three that I

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.690 
frames and these are the three that I
kind<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.860> used<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> most

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
kind of used the most

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120 
kind of used the most
so<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> actually<00:02:50.480> assigned<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:51.290> hotkey

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
so I actually assigned them hotkey

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.160 
so I actually assigned them hotkey
combos<00:02:52.580> I'd<00:02:52.970> use<00:02:53.210> these<00:02:53.390> really<00:02:53.630> kind<00:02:54.050> of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
combos I'd use these really kind of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.830 
combos I'd use these really kind of
elaborate<00:02:55.040> combinations<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> lot<00:02:56.750> of

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
elaborate combinations because a lot of

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.330 
elaborate combinations because a lot of
the<00:02:56.900> key<00:02:57.080> combinations<00:02:57.620> were<00:02:57.710> already<00:02:57.890> taken

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the key combinations were already taken

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.040 
the key combinations were already taken
so<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.730> add<00:02:59.000> new<00:02:59.270> ones<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.870> go<00:02:59.990> to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
so to add new ones you just go to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.710 
so to add new ones you just go to
keyboard<00:03:00.410> shortcuts<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.300> go<00:03:02.390> up<00:03:02.480> here

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
keyboard shortcuts and you go up here

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.080 
keyboard shortcuts and you go up here
and<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.350> go<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.470> layer<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:04.820> go<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.030> we

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and you go to layer and we go and we

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.300 
and you go to layer and we go and we
find<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.630> video<00:03:05.870> layer<00:03:06.170> section<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.070> it's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
find the video layer section so it's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.500 
find the video layer section so it's
like<00:03:07.570> down<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:08.810> somewhere<00:03:10.300> here<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.390> is

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
like down here somewhere here it is

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.570 
like down here somewhere here it is
video<00:03:12.290> layers<00:03:12.560> if<00:03:12.740> I<00:03:12.830> can<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.070> clear<00:03:13.370> this

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
video layers if I can just clear this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.880 
video layers if I can just clear this
shortcut<00:03:14.450> out<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.780> can<00:03:14.900> go<00:03:15.050> ctrl<00:03:15.530> shift<00:03:15.560> all

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
do a command that already exists it will

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.840 
do a command that already exists it will
warn<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:22.100> if<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.370> were<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.520> do<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.700> again

warn you so if I were to do this again

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.199 
warn you so if I were to do this again
an<00:03:23.290> S<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.620> tells<00:03:24.830> me<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.100> already<00:03:25.490> in<00:03:25.670> use<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
an S it tells me it's already in use and

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.140 
an S it tells me it's already in use and
I<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:27.140> want<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.320> kind<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.530> undo<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.220> or<00:03:28.459> not

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
I just want to kind of undo that or not

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.430 
I just want to kind of undo that or not
accept<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:29.810> I'll<00:03:29.990> leave<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.290> way<00:03:30.320> it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
accept it just I'll leave it the way it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.350 
accept it just I'll leave it the way it
is<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.709> except<00:03:31.040> okay<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.060> makes<00:03:32.240> it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
is so except okay and this makes it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.790 
is so except okay and this makes it
process<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> lot<00:03:32.930> easier<00:03:32.959> because<00:03:33.410> if<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.590> want

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
process a lot easier because if I want

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.680 
process a lot easier because if I want
to<00:03:33.860> duplicate<00:03:34.220> frames<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.670> can<00:03:34.790> press<00:03:34.910> ctrl<00:03:35.209> D<00:03:35.240> I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
to duplicate frames I can press ctrl D I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.290 
to duplicate frames I can press ctrl D I
can<00:03:35.900> duplicate<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.650> out<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.970> now<00:03:38.120> this

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
can duplicate this out and so now this

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.540 
can duplicate this out and so now this
is<00:03:38.450> longer<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.200> then<00:03:39.350> on<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:39.920> next<00:03:40.280> frame<00:03:40.520> I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
is longer and then on my next frame I

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.640 
is longer and then on my next frame I
can<00:03:40.910> draw<00:03:41.360> again<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.870> I'll<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.140> new<00:03:42.350> frame

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
can draw again and I'll have a new frame

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.530 
can draw again and I'll have a new frame
and<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.490> can<00:03:43.640> duplicate<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.090> out<00:03:44.300> as<00:03:44.450> many

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
and I can duplicate that out as many

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.600 
and I can duplicate that out as many
times<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.020> I<00:03:45.140> need<00:03:45.350> I've<00:03:45.830> been<00:03:46.100> finding<00:03:46.340> if<00:03:46.550> I

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
times as I need I've been finding if I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.490 
times as I need I've been finding if I
want<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:46.880> shift<00:03:47.120> things<00:03:47.420> over<00:03:47.810> I<00:03:47.840> can<00:03:48.110> insert<00:03:48.440> a

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
want to shift things over I can insert a

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.760 
want to shift things over I can insert a
blank<00:03:48.830> frame<00:03:49.220> course<00:03:50.180> ctrl<00:03:50.510> shift<00:03:50.540> alt<00:03:50.989> D<00:03:51.440> I

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
blank frame course ctrl shift alt D I

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.130 
blank frame course ctrl shift alt D I
can<00:03:52.370> just<00:03:52.520> move<00:03:52.730> things<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:53.180> way<00:03:53.360> or<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.660> can

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
can just move things that way or I can

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.130 
can just move things that way or I can
go<00:03:54.290> here<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.680> ctrl<00:03:55.130> ctrl<00:03:55.550> alt<00:03:56.030> X<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.900> just

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
go here and ctrl ctrl alt X and just

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.110 
go here and ctrl ctrl alt X and just
delete<00:03:57.410> frames<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.520> it's<00:03:58.610> one<00:03:58.760> way<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:58.910> move

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
delete frames so it's one way to move

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.630 
delete frames so it's one way to move
things<00:03:59.270> around<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.690> can't<00:04:00.100> find<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.280> way<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.459> just

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
things around I can't find a way to just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120 
things around I can't find a way to just
click<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.150> drag<00:04:02.239> these<00:04:02.840> clips<00:04:03.290> these<00:04:03.800> clip

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
click and drag these clips these clip

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.550 
click and drag these clips these clip
sections<00:04:04.550> I'm<00:04:04.730> not<00:04:04.880> sure<00:04:05.060> why<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.239> can't<00:04:05.600> they

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
sections I'm not sure why I can't they

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.900 
sections I'm not sure why I can't they
have<00:04:06.680> they<00:04:06.980> look<00:04:07.010> like<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.489> could<00:04:07.610> click<00:04:07.790> it

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
have they look like you could click it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.190 
have they look like you could click it
drag<00:04:08.030> them<00:04:08.270> but<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.450> can't<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.810> can't<00:04:09.080> if<00:04:09.170> you

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
drag them but you can't you can't if you

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.990 
drag them but you can't you can't if you
drag<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.590> whole<00:04:09.800> thing<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.370> found<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:10.850> way

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
drag the whole thing I found this way

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.790 
drag the whole thing I found this way
works<00:04:11.209> fine<00:04:11.480> especially<00:04:12.050> for<00:04:12.260> layout<00:04:12.590> because

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
works fine especially for layout because

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.680 
works fine especially for layout because
I'm<00:04:12.980> just<00:04:13.160> doing<00:04:13.370> straight<00:04:13.700> ahead<00:04:14.030> stuff<00:04:14.390> and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
I'm just doing straight ahead stuff and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.170 
I'm just doing straight ahead stuff and
drawing<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.410> seal<00:04:15.620> in<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:16.760> other<00:04:16.910> thing<00:04:17.090> is

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
drawing the seal in the other thing is

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.180 
drawing the seal in the other thing is
the<00:04:17.270> onion<00:04:17.600> skinning<00:04:17.840> we<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.680> go<00:04:18.770> up<00:04:18.859> here<00:04:18.890> we

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
the onion skinning we just go up here we

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.670 
the onion skinning we just go up here we
just<00:04:19.370> turn<00:04:19.609> on<00:04:19.760> onions<00:04:20.180> kidding<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:21.350> set<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
just turn on onions kidding and I set it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.950 
just turn on onions kidding and I set it
to<00:04:22.040> screen<00:04:22.580> because<00:04:23.000> multiply<00:04:23.539> was<00:04:23.750> too

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
to screen because multiply was too

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.840 
to screen because multiply was too
extreme<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.100> did<00:04:25.250> for<00:04:25.280> frames

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
extreme and that I just did for frames

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.969 
extreme and that I just did for frames
before<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.169> can<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.350> frames<00:04:27.560> before<00:04:27.890> and

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
before so you can have frames before and

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.230 
before so you can have frames before and
after<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.460> can<00:04:28.669> see<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.030> in

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
after so you can see the in

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.610 
after so you can see the in
coming<00:04:29.479> an<00:04:29.569> outgoing<00:04:29.840> frame<00:04:30.169> but<00:04:30.319> I<00:04:30.380> just<00:04:30.530> did

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
coming an outgoing frame but I just did

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.550 
coming an outgoing frame but I just did
frames<00:04:30.860> before<00:04:31.069> just<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.000> keep<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.270> easy<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:33.530> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
frames before just to keep it easy so I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.200 
frames before just to keep it easy so I
put<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.830> 2-0<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.190> also<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.759> there's<00:04:34.910> not<00:04:35.060> so

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
put it 2-0 and also so there's not so

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.240 
put it 2-0 and also so there's not so
much<00:04:35.300> information<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.080> now<00:04:36.199> if<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.680> go<00:04:36.830> here<00:04:37.039> I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
much information so now if I go here I

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.210 
much information so now if I go here I
draw<00:04:37.819> a<00:04:37.849> new<00:04:38.000> shape<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.539> can<00:04:38.660> see<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.199> can<00:04:40.160> do

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
draw a new shape you can see it I can do

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.640 
draw a new shape you can see it I can do
a<00:04:40.280> new<00:04:40.400> shape<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.110> ways<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.349> was<00:04:42.470> doing

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
a new shape one of the ways I was doing

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.370 
a new shape one of the ways I was doing
is<00:04:42.710> just<00:04:42.919> drawing<00:04:43.220> my<00:04:43.430> frames<00:04:43.759> on<00:04:44.180> ones<00:04:44.960> and

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
is just drawing my frames on ones and

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.200 
is just drawing my frames on ones and
then<00:04:45.560> actually<00:04:45.979> just<00:04:46.009> after<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:46.940> kind<00:04:47.090> of

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
then actually just after I kind of

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.300 
then actually just after I kind of
figure<00:04:47.449> out<00:04:47.479> my<00:04:47.720> cycle<00:04:48.199> I'm<00:04:48.740> just<00:04:49.009> going<00:04:49.220> in

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
figure out my cycle I'm just going in

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.830 
figure out my cycle I'm just going in
and<00:04:49.430> duplicating<00:04:49.940> those<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:50.240> ctrl<00:04:50.569> D

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
and duplicating those so ctrl D

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.010 
and duplicating those so ctrl D
duplicating<00:04:51.560> as<00:04:51.680> many<00:04:51.860> as<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.099> need<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:53.020> that's

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
duplicating as many as I need and that's

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.480 
duplicating as many as I need and that's
sort<00:04:54.199> of<00:04:54.289> slowing<00:04:54.620> down<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.919> animation<00:04:55.310> it's

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
sort of slowing down the animation it's

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.330 
sort of slowing down the animation it's
pretty<00:04:55.789> primitive<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.509> isn't<00:04:56.840> ideal<00:04:57.130> but<00:04:58.130> it

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
pretty primitive this isn't ideal but it

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.450 
pretty primitive this isn't ideal but it
works<00:04:58.520> for<00:04:58.729> me<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.479> just<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.840> Photoshop

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
works for me if you just have Photoshop

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.399 
works for me if you just have Photoshop
it's<00:05:01.460> it's<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.270> easy<00:05:02.569> enough<00:05:02.750> once<00:05:03.199> you<00:05:03.289> get

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
it's it's it's easy enough once you get

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.629 
it's it's it's easy enough once you get
the<00:05:03.470> hang<00:05:03.500> of<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.830> it's<00:05:04.009> pretty<00:05:04.250> easy<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.550> work

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
the hang of it it's pretty easy to work

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.640 
the hang of it it's pretty easy to work
through<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.120> again<00:05:05.330> it's<00:05:05.870> just<00:05:05.990> layout

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
through and again it's just layout

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.499 
through and again it's just layout
animation<00:05:07.490> I'm<00:05:07.580> just<00:05:07.729> blocking<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.300> scene

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
animation I'm just blocking the scene

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.360 
animation I'm just blocking the scene
trying<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.930> figure<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.169> out<00:05:09.319> okay<00:05:10.009> so<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:10.190> hope

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
trying to figure it out okay so I hope

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.040 
trying to figure it out okay so I hope
