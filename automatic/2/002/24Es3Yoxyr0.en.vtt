00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030 

this<00:00:00.269> video<00:00:00.630> begins<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.350> ideas<00:00:01.770> of<00:00:01.920> the

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
this video begins the ideas of the

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.610 
this video begins the ideas of the
positivist<00:00:02.669> school<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.210> Criminology<00:00:03.629> this

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
positivist school of Criminology this

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.079 
positivist school of Criminology this
school<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.040> thought<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.370> divided<00:00:05.609> into<00:00:05.819> three

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
school of thought is divided into three

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.780 
school of thought is divided into three
categories<00:00:06.710> biological<00:00:07.710> psychological<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
categories biological psychological and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910 
categories biological psychological and
social<00:00:08.990> these<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.170> three<00:00:10.380> separate<00:00:10.710> ideas

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
social these are three separate ideas

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.770 
social these are three separate ideas
but<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.730> overlap<00:00:12.030> between<00:00:12.389> them

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
but there is some overlap between them

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.419 
but there is some overlap between them
hence<00:00:13.110> why<00:00:13.320> they<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.799> grouping<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
hence why they are all grouping or a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340 
hence why they are all grouping or a
larger<00:00:14.820> school<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.210> thought<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:16.109> you've

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
larger school of thought as you've

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
larger school of thought as you've
probably<00:00:16.619> guessed<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.310> video<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
probably guessed this video is about the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.870 
probably guessed this video is about the
biological<00:00:18.240> theory<00:00:19.140> hey<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.369> Wednesday<00:00:20.820> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
biological theory hey it's Wednesday so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
biological theory hey it's Wednesday so
the<00:00:21.119> biological<00:00:21.779> theory<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.170> crime<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> pretty

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the biological theory of crime is pretty

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.009 
the biological theory of crime is pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:24.119> basically<00:00:24.720> says<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
self-explanatory it basically says that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.259 
self-explanatory it basically says that
there<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.590> biological<00:00:25.980> reason<00:00:26.640> people

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
there is a biological reason people

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.570 
there is a biological reason people
become<00:00:27.720> criminals<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.890> theory<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.340> first

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
become criminals this theory was first

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.980 
become criminals this theory was first
introduced<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> time<00:00:30.750> people

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
introduced around the time people

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.229 
introduced around the time people
started<00:00:31.500> examining<00:00:32.219> human<00:00:32.730> bodies<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
started examining human bodies and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
started examining human bodies and
medical<00:00:33.600> science<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:34.290> brand<00:00:34.620> new<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.070> first

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
medical science was brand new the first

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
medical science was brand new the first
ideas<00:00:35.760> from<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.090> theory<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.690> about

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
ideas from this theory are all about

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
ideas from this theory are all about
genetics<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.670> evidence<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
genetics now there is some evidence that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
genetics now there is some evidence that
links<00:00:39.719> criminal<00:00:40.079> behavior<00:00:40.590> between<00:00:40.770> parents

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
links criminal behavior between parents

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
links criminal behavior between parents
and<00:00:41.550> their<00:00:41.640> children<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.719> father

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and their children like if your father

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
and their children like if your father
killed<00:00:43.500> someone<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.610> likely<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
killed someone it's more likely that you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.029 
killed someone it's more likely that you
will<00:00:45.629> too<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.289> might<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.649> thinking<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
will too now you might be thinking that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
will too now you might be thinking that
this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> social<00:00:48.270> idea<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.020> maybe

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this is more of a social idea then maybe

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.600 
this is more of a social idea then maybe
children<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> product<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.399> their

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
children are a product of their

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
children are a product of their
environment<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.870> starting<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
environment you starting to see the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.319 
environment you starting to see the
overlap<00:00:52.770> between<00:00:53.129> these<00:00:53.520> theories<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
overlap between these theories now the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
overlap between these theories now the
next<00:00:54.570> development<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.079> biological<00:00:55.739> theory

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
next development the biological theory

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
next development the biological theory
feels<00:00:56.219> less<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.789> genetics<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.539> with

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
feels less with genetics and more with

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
feels less with genetics and more with
actual<00:00:58.199> physical<00:00:58.770> characteristics<00:00:59.219> there

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
actual physical characteristics there

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.220 
actual physical characteristics there
are<00:00:59.969> studies<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.449> show<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.899> most

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
are studies that show that most

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.950 
are studies that show that most
prisoners<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.250> larger<00:01:02.879> build<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
prisoners have a larger build and if you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
prisoners have a larger build and if you
look<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> bigger<00:01:05.760> body

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
look at people with this bigger body

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
look at people with this bigger body
structure<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.140> people<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> smaller<00:01:07.979> body

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
structure and people with a smaller body

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.390 
structure and people with a smaller body
type<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.330> ratio<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.049> higher<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.799> prisons

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
type the ratio is much higher in prisons

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
type the ratio is much higher in prisons
than<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> outside<00:01:12.299> world<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.840> some

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
than in the outside world and some

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.179 
than in the outside world and some
people<00:01:13.290> say<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.740> physical

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
people say that these physical

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.980 
people say that these physical
characteristics<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> having<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> larger<00:01:15.810> body

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
characteristics of having a larger body

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
characteristics of having a larger body
type<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.680> lead<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> violent<00:01:17.700> criminal

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
type are what lead to violent criminal

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
type are what lead to violent criminal
behavior<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.540> therefore<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.290> pretty

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
behavior and therefore they are pretty

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
behavior and therefore they are pretty
much<00:01:19.740> predestined<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.820> criminals<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.390> as

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
much predestined to be criminals now as

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.210 
much predestined to be criminals now as
with<00:01:21.750> every<00:01:22.020> theory<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.979> things

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
with every theory there are some things

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
with every theory there are some things
we<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> can't<00:01:23.580> explain<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> can't

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
we just can't explain like you can't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
we just can't explain like you can't
explain<00:01:25.170> burglary<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.130> any<00:01:26.340> type<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> theft

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
explain burglary or any type of theft

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
explain burglary or any type of theft
with<00:01:27.360> biology<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:28.740> can't<00:01:29.009> explain

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
with biology this also can't explain

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
with biology this also can't explain
white-collar<00:01:29.970> crime<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.630> insurance<00:01:31.110> fraud

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
white-collar crime like insurance fraud

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
white-collar crime like insurance fraud
or<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> Ponzi<00:01:32.159> scheme<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> previous<00:01:33.180> video

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
or a Ponzi scheme in the previous video

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.700 
or a Ponzi scheme in the previous video
in<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.689> series<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.140> talked<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
in this series I talked about the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.469 
in this series I talked about the
Classical<00:01:35.280> School<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.299> how

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
Classical School which is all about how

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
Classical School which is all about how
people<00:01:36.869> use<00:01:37.079> their<00:01:37.350> rational<00:01:38.040> mind<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.700> choose

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
