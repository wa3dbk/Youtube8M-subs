00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to show you that it's not always

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.799 
to show you that it's not always
changing<00:00:58.730> and<00:01:00.469> yeah<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.449> basically<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
changing and yeah so basically what I do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.010 
changing and yeah so basically what I do
is<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.729> have<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> pocket<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> air<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.900> my

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
is I have I put a pocket of air in my

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.490 
is I have I put a pocket of air in my
cheek<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:09.380> basically<00:01:10.380> just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
cheek right here and I basically just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
cheek right here and I basically just
talk<00:01:10.799> normally<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.570> air<00:01:12.689> goes

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
talk normally but all the air goes

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
talk normally but all the air goes
through<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.229> cheat<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:15.000> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.299> hard

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
through the cheat and it's kind of hard

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.370 
through the cheat and it's kind of hard
to<00:01:15.600> explain<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:17.570> if<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.229> uh<00:01:21.380> goes

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to explain but if it it just uh goes

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
to explain but if it it just uh goes
through<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.009> Gator<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:28.040> huh<00:01:29.420> sorry<00:01:30.420> it's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
through to Gator and huh sorry it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
through to Gator and huh sorry it's
first<00:01:30.840> time<00:01:30.930> don't<00:01:31.290> whether<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.590> thought

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
first time don't whether you thought

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.310 
first time don't whether you thought
it's<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.030> difficult<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:35.210> but

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
it's just really difficult to do but

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's just really difficult to do but
usually<00:01:37.320> you'll<00:01:37.860> hear<00:01:38.040> me<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.340> lobby<00:01:38.579> say<00:01:40.549> or

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
usually you'll hear me and lobby say or

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.380 
usually you'll hear me and lobby say or
something<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
something like that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
something like that
because<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.020> easy<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> say<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.729> hot

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because it's easy to say it's not as hot

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.750 
because it's easy to say it's not as hot
difficult<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:45.960> things<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.740> say

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.770 

I<00:01:51.520> don't<00:01:52.520> really<00:01:52.670> know<00:01:52.850> how<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.090> put<00:01:53.390> say<00:01:53.720> in

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
I don't really know how to put say in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.150 
I don't really know how to put say in
this<00:01:53.990> video<00:01:54.170> but<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:56.060> not<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.360> voice<00:01:56.630> changer

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
this video but it's not a voice changer

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.700

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
Bryan 1997 it's not a voice changer so

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.980 
Bryan 1997 it's not a voice changer so
you<00:02:06.590> all<00:02:06.770> might<00:02:07.070> say<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:07.760> it's<00:02:07.910> not<00:02:10.990> and
