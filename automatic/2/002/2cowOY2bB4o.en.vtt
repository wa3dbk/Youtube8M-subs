garage door extension spring as you can

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.530 
garage door extension spring as you can
see<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> spring<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.440> broken<00:00:14.150> one<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> two

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
see the spring has broken one of the two

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960 
see the spring has broken one of the two
spring<00:00:15.840> has<00:00:15.990> broken<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.730> and<00:00:17.730> there's<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
spring has broken here and there's a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120 
spring has broken here and there's a
safety<00:00:18.360> loop<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.200> it<00:00:19.410> keeps<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> spring

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
safety loop here and it keeps the spring

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
safety loop here and it keeps the spring
from<00:00:20.480> actually<00:00:21.480> damaging<00:00:22.880> vehicles<00:00:27.500> so

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
from actually damaging vehicles so

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
from actually damaging vehicles so

about<00:00:43.380> this<00:00:45.290> about<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:47.340> setup<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
about this about this setup is that it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
about this about this setup is that it
doesn't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.219> boat<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> release<00:00:50.820> the

doesn't have a boat here to release the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.190 
doesn't have a boat here to release the
tension<00:00:51.410> like<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:54.020> doors<00:00:55.020> I've

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
tension like on the other doors I've

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.209 
tension like on the other doors I've
seen<00:00:56.000> here's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.829> here's<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.860> much<00:00:59.070> better

seen here's a here's a much better
picture<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.750> what<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> looks<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.110> here<00:01:02.510> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
picture of what it looks like here this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
picture of what it looks like here this
is<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.880> left<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:05.970> hinge<00:01:06.920> with

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is now this is the left side hinge with

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.190 
is now this is the left side hinge with
the<00:01:08.039> two<00:01:08.220> springs<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.470> right<00:01:10.470> side<00:01:10.740> inge

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the two springs and the right side inge

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.060 
the two springs and the right side inge
is<00:01:13.200> here

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.870 

so<00:01:16.730> what<00:01:16.910> I'm<00:01:17.030> going<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.210> be<00:01:17.300> doing<00:01:17.570> is

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
so what I'm going to be doing is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.880 
so what I'm going to be doing is
actually<00:01:19.880> removing<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.630> cotter<00:01:20.960> pin<00:01:21.290> here

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.010 

and<00:01:25.010> then<00:01:25.550> pulling<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.060> out<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.630> take<00:01:26.840> out

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
and then pulling this out to take out

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.070 
and then pulling this out to take out
the<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:28.670> first<00:01:28.940> spring<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.360> then<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.750> want<00:01:30.050> to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
the the first spring and then I want to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.960 
the the first spring and then I want to
take<00:01:30.200> out<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.410> second<00:01:30.800> spring<00:01:30.980> it's<00:01:31.550> an<00:01:31.820> it's

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
take out the second spring it's an it's

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.130 
take out the second spring it's an it's
a<00:01:32.090> little<00:01:32.540> bit<00:01:32.630> under<00:01:32.840> tension<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:35.020> most<00:01:36.020> of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
a little bit under tension so most of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.750 
a little bit under tension so most of
the<00:01:36.230> tension<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:36.770> released<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:37.520> going<00:01:37.730> to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
the tension is released but I'm going to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.400 
the tension is released but I'm going to
just<00:01:38.060> pull<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.390> up<00:01:38.480> with<00:01:38.630> my<00:01:38.780> bodyweight<00:01:39.230> and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
just pull it up with my bodyweight and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.000 
just pull it up with my bodyweight and
it<00:01:39.650> should<00:01:39.860> come<00:01:40.040> off<00:01:40.220> pretty<00:01:40.430> easy<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.979> first

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
it should come off pretty easy the first

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.500 
it should come off pretty easy the first
thing<00:01:43.400> you're<00:01:43.850> going<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.030> want<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.240> do<00:01:44.390> is

thing you're going to want to do is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.040 
thing you're going to want to do is
actually<00:01:44.720> brace<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.620> garage<00:01:46.100> door<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:47.050> did

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
actually brace the garage door I did

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.400 
actually brace the garage door I did
this<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.410> a<00:01:48.520> aluminum<00:01:49.520> ladder<00:01:49.910> and<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.990> cooler

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
this with a aluminum ladder and a cooler

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.120 
this with a aluminum ladder and a cooler
right<00:01:51.979> above<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.400> it's<00:01:52.760> kind<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.540> rickety<00:01:54.130> but

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
right above it it's kind of rickety but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.740 
right above it it's kind of rickety but
this<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.520> not<00:01:55.670> my<00:01:55.820> house<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.180> don't<00:01:56.300> really<00:01:56.540> have

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
this is not my house I don't really have

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.150 
this is not my house I don't really have
the<00:01:57.050> tools<00:01:57.560> here<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.330> do<00:01:59.479> what<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.979> make

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
the tools here so I do what I can make

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.410 
the tools here so I do what I can make
do<00:02:01.369> with<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:02.050> materia<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.229> have<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.180> this

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
do with the materia that I have so this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.640 
do with the materia that I have so this
should<00:02:05.630> work

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.240 

all<00:02:11.650> right<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.250> there's<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:13.890> there's<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> little

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
all right so there's a there's a little

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.660 
all right so there's a there's a little
ring<00:02:15.460> here<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.970> keep<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:18.420> keep<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.450> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
ring here to keep the keep the this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.260 
ring here to keep the keep the this
metal<00:02:21.670> safety<00:02:22.320> bar<00:02:23.320> from<00:02:23.650> falling<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.310> take

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
metal safety bar from falling out take

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.900 
metal safety bar from falling out take
this<00:02:25.420> out<00:02:26.880> there<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.000> go<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.760> can

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this out there you go and then you can

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.490 
this out there you go and then you can
slide<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.390> pin<00:02:31.600> up

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160 

there's<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> pin<00:02:36.690> now<00:02:37.690> we're<00:02:37.870> going<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> be

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
there's the pin now we're going to be

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.390 
there's the pin now we're going to be
doing<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.650> pulling<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.580> off<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:41.400> rod

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
doing is pulling this off of this rod

00:02:42.400 --> 00:03:39.369 
doing is pulling this off of this rod
here<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.910> then<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.870> will<00:02:44.050> come<00:02:44.230> off<00:02:44.260> easily

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:47.830 

the<00:03:39.739> broken<00:03:40.010> ones<00:03:40.310> actually<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:47.569> should<00:03:47.810> be

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
the broken ones actually you should be
