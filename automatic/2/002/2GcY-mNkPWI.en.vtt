through here let's try the Spot Healing
Brush<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.460> see<00:03:42.730> if<00:03:42.790> we<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.030> make<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.330> go

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
Brush and see if we can make that go

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.290 
Brush and see if we can make that go
away<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:43.870> I'm<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.350> going<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.560> draw<00:03:45.300> right

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
away so I'm just going to draw right

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.260 
away so I'm just going to draw right
along<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.820> sometimes<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:49.120> works

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
along it and sometimes it works

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.120 
along it and sometimes it works
sometimes<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.750> doesn't<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.740> one<00:03:50.920> actually

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
sometimes it doesn't that one actually

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.210 
sometimes it doesn't that one actually
works<00:03:51.460> fairly<00:03:51.760> well<00:03:52.000> there's<00:03:52.960> still<00:03:53.020> some<00:03:53.440> a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
works fairly well there's still some a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.950 
works fairly well there's still some a
little<00:03:54.670> bit<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.880> line<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.570> here<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> think

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
little bit of line going on here I think

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.050 
little bit of line going on here I think
we<00:03:56.200> want<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.470> fix<00:03:56.710> that<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.550> what<00:03:57.760> I'm<00:03:57.880> going<00:03:58.000> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
we want to fix that so what I'm going to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.100 
we want to fix that so what I'm going to

nice job

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.469 
nice job
so<00:04:45.430> there's<00:04:45.550> two<00:04:45.699> different<00:04:45.880> ways<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.240> do<00:04:46.360> it

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
so there's two different ways to do it

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.850 
so there's two different ways to do it
now<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.660> actually<00:04:46.900> even<00:04:47.380> more<00:04:47.590> than<00:04:47.740> that

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
now and actually even more than that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860 
now and actually even more than that
some<00:04:48.039> people<00:04:48.280> still<00:04:48.550> use<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.449> clone<00:04:49.630> brush

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
some people still use the clone brush

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.140 
some people still use the clone brush
the<00:04:50.680> Spot<00:04:51.069> Healing<00:04:51.100> Brush<00:04:51.400> or<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:51.880> healing

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
the Spot Healing Brush or the healing

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.969

brush<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.509> general<00:04:52.930> or<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.349> patch<00:04:53.530> tool<00:04:53.560> it

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
brush in general or the patch tool it

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.439 
brush in general or the patch tool it
seems<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.280> work<00:04:54.370> better<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.759> cleaning<00:04:55.330> of
