00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it and I'm thinking about all the time

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.669 
it and I'm thinking about all the time
so<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> works<00:00:31.199> both<00:00:31.410> ways

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so it works both ways

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:44.470 
so it works both ways
so<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:33.000> when<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> players<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.079> come

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.940 

the<00:00:45.480> best<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.469> come<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the best for when they come out the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
the best for when they come out the
players<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> basketball<00:00:48.539> players

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
players you know the basketball players

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869

when<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.379> come<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
when they come out what do you do you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.670

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.869 
think it's more of how when they come
out<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.640> feel
