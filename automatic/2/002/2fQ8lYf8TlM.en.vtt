00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.050 
December by 18th but it's still pretty
early<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.160> think<00:00:17.220> they<00:00:17.460> might<00:00:17.609> move<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.880> back

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
early I think they might move it back

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.429 
early I think they might move it back
because<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.510> pretty<00:00:18.750> close<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.199> other

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
because it's pretty close to the other

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.099 
because it's pretty close to the other
