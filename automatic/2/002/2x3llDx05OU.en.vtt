this<00:02:46.950> place<00:02:47.249> is<00:02:47.519> perfect<00:02:47.790> for<00:02:48.090> paragliders

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
this place is perfect for paragliders

this place is perfect for paragliders
with<00:02:48.959> heaps<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.379> room<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.799> chill<00:02:50.040> out<00:02:50.189> but

with heaps of room to chill out but
everything<00:02:51.239> looks<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.629> lot<00:02:51.810> smaller<00:02:52.170> when

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
everything looks a lot smaller when

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.449 
everything looks a lot smaller when
you're<00:02:52.650> 1,000<00:02:53.310> meters<00:02:53.639> out<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:55.219> can't<00:02:56.219> believe

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you're 1,000 meters out I can't believe

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.229 
you're 1,000 meters out I can't believe
how<00:02:56.639> high<00:02:56.849> we<00:02:57.030> are

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
how high we are

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.229 
how high we are
this<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.659> insane<00:02:58.549> but<00:02:59.549> as<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> laws<00:03:00.030> of

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this is insane but as the laws of

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is insane but as the laws of
physics<00:03:00.420> tell<00:03:00.870> us<00:03:00.989> everything<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.829> goes<00:03:02.010> up

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
physics tell us everything that goes up
