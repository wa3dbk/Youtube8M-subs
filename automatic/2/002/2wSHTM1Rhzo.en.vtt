the cross hard version of this i did not
get<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> though<00:02:05.630> which<00:02:06.630> means<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> will

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
get it though which means it will

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.010

though I got the one that had the DVD
Drive<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.240> because<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.660> don't<00:02:12.140> really<00:02:12.200> play

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
