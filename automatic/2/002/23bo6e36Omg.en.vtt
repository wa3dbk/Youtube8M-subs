00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
video I would just post it today where

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.340 
video I would just post it today where
it<00:01:33.979> has<00:01:34.100> my<00:01:34.280> strategy<00:01:34.790> for<00:01:34.869> defeating<00:01:35.869> this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
it has my strategy for defeating this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:48.860 
it has my strategy for defeating this
level

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.150 

so<00:01:49.870> you<00:01:49.930> can<00:01:50.110> see<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.320> has<00:01:50.410> like<00:01:50.620> a<00:01:50.650> 3d<00:01:51.040> effect

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
so you can see it has like a 3d effect

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.220 
so you can see it has like a 3d effect
it's<00:01:51.790> got<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.940> tunnel<00:01:52.510> right<00:01:52.600> here<00:01:52.810> where<00:01:53.110> they

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
it's got a tunnel right here where they

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's got a tunnel right here where they
can<00:01:53.350> go<00:01:53.470> in<00:01:53.500> or<00:01:53.920> out<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.930> have<00:01:56.050> obstacles

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
can go in or out and you have obstacles

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.100 
can go in or out and you have obstacles
that<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.130> need<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.370> build<00:01:57.550> around<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.020> they

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
that you need to build around so they

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
that you need to build around so they
come<00:01:59.290> in<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.620> and<00:01:59.890> they<00:01:59.980> exit<00:02:00.670> over<00:02:00.910> here<00:02:00.940> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
come in here and they exit over here so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:41.210 
come in here and they exit over here so
basically<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.710> want<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.950> wrap<00:02:03.130> them<00:02:03.310> around

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:56.699 

so<00:02:42.220> I'll<00:02:42.400> zoom<00:02:42.640> into<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.940> laser<00:02:43.600> action<00:02:43.959> here

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.970 

so<00:02:57.709> definitely<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.670> cool<00:02:59.000> new<00:02:59.150> weapon<00:02:59.510> here<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
very short path to travel to get to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.920 
very short path to travel to get to
their<00:03:34.750> destination<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.470> cost<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> life<00:03:37.190> so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
their destination to cost you a life so

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:57.939 

you

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.620 

you<00:04:58.949> can<00:04:59.190> see<00:04:59.370> how<00:04:59.460> apply<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.000> map<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.300> to

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
you can see how apply this map is to

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.370 
you can see how apply this map is to
start<00:05:00.930> upgrading<00:05:01.110> things<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:03.380> circle

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
start upgrading things just a circle
