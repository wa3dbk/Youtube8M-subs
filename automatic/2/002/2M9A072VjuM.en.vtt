like<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.630> real<00:02:50.870> long<00:02:51.110> board<00:02:51.440> they're<00:02:51.739> not<00:02:51.890> just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
like a real long board they're not just

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.530 
like a real long board they're not just
reversed<00:02:52.519> they're<00:02:52.790> actually<00:02:53.299> different

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540

different they're black on the outside
with<00:03:01.489> red<00:03:01.850> on<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> inside<00:03:02.239> I'm<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.079> sure<00:03:03.260> if

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380

and I thought that was cool now the
coolest<00:03:33.319> part<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.769> all<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.489> these<00:03:34.910> were

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
coolest part of all is that these were

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.080 
coolest part of all is that these were
