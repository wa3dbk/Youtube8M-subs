00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.209
 However 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 but 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 photo 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.970
 we returned to the post apocalyptic exhibition metro 2033 thanks to a 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.460
 new journals made in the Italian offices 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.560
 what accounts drive renewal arrivals live first details home what one does 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.430
 announces to be an interesting first person photo shooter from outside 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 let's discover together in this our preview video it's 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 hahaha 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 read symptoms 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.270
 love we have already spoken in recent months in an extensive way by metro 2033 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.900
 blackberries and obligation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.440
 the title produced by thq and developed from the outside if it tries to enter with force 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the kind of first-person shooters offering a temple technically 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 forefront 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.880
 and as a post-apocalyptic atmosphere that so much in detail care 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.580
 to the homonymous book from which it is taken 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.770
 an experiment that fascinates also representing the red thread between 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 the productions of Eastern Europe League on the cock all with pragmatism 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.330
 programmatic there dental what brings in the video game stores treated in 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 minimum details and not constantly coming 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 Yup 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 date 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
 cooked and eaten artyom is our protagonist a young nuclear place 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.130
 who lives in the subway state of the fly of twenty years into the future 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 its initial task 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
 and to reach the stop of poli sa one of the many stations of the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.480
 subway converted the outpost 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.060
 the journey gets tough dying of people arrives homeless fellow travelers from 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.960
 turbulent past of the accounts in suspense but all in all boncore 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.610
 you move among the tunnels you shoot little but when you do it to survive 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.410
 some meetings are held at last you go out into the bile mosque 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.730
 only for short periods 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.939
 and fitted with a mask so as not to remain contaminated 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.699
 the first hour and a half of a 2033 atypical narrator widens sections 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.699
 very nice 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.930
 the next hour continues on the same line 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.370
 alternating firefights with those that can hardly be defined 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.650
 as a sprinkle being extremely linear without substantial possibilities 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.440
 of choice 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.859
 rather as a sort of interactive narrative 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.049
 the almost due to the presence on screen of a character controlled by di 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.450
 artificial intelligence dictates the timing of the action in concert with the ever 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.239
 effective scripting 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.180
 when it comes to putting the gun to the work done by the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.459
 developers wrapped up in questioning the normal superiority 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.959
 the user compared to the opponents decreasing the latter number but almost 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.620
 it was a survival horror 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.350
 giving a few shots to shoot when facing non-human abersee 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.770
 not taking the presence of the knife as a last hope unrealistic 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.849
 there are however some passages on which there is still to work or that anyway 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.119
 they will have to show an evolution during the adventure 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.139
 in particular level design that in its substantial simplicity convinces 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.270
 when under the ground 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.969
 but it seemed - characterized on the outside 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.529
 with the passages among the ruins of the alternate crates of the corridors of luck 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.809
 decidedly uninspired 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.659
 artificial intelligence I should end shows some of the refinement because 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 all too often it shows gaps 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.869
 whether you use the mouse and keyboard pair or the pad meets lynx 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:15.809
 they are extremely simple but the feeling of physicality made by weapons 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.150
 and it's heavy movements. right not to represent in itself a value 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.230
 also added to play 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.370
 but they marry with the will to increase their lives to the maximum 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.639
 very good sound that will accompany a visual compartment of 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.900
 very close up 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.740
 except for some hair scenes 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.470
 the visual spectacle on the PC was really guaranteed women lighting 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.310
 awesome 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.930
 with multiple light sources capable of creating convincing shadows 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.960
 and go hand in hand with particle effects of the highest order 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.989
 xbox e3 60 the lesser presence under the bonnet seems to make itself felt 

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.430
 quite obvious 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.130
 but it still makes no sense to give definitive judgments on a version that does not 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:00.199
 meter 2033 is expected for March 19 instead of me and xbox 60 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.840
 there is still time for talking again in the coming weeks 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 goodbye
