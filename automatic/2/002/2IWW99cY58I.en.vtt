00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
be ops moon bases yeah Oh computer

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.990 
be ops moon bases yeah Oh computer
terminals<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:06.369> got<00:01:06.549> these<00:01:06.700> cool<00:01:06.939> little

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
terminals it's got these cool little

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.060 
terminals it's got these cool little
gasp<00:01:07.960> odds<00:01:08.259> that<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.530> can<00:01:08.680> put<00:01:08.829> throughout

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
gasp odds that you can put throughout

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.640 
gasp odds that you can put throughout
your<00:01:09.250> world<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.820> those<00:01:10.780> are<00:01:10.960> called<00:01:11.110> gas<00:01:11.380> bags

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
your world and those are called gas bags

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.800 
your world and those are called gas bags
yeah<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.040> would<00:01:12.340> guess<00:01:12.549> on<00:01:12.820> gas<00:01:13.329> box<00:01:13.600> or

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
yeah I would guess on gas box or

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.980 
yeah I would guess on gas box or
gastropods<00:01:14.520> visually<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.149> we've<00:01:16.719> got<00:01:16.869> this

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
gastropods visually and we've got this

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.230 
gastropods visually and we've got this
great<00:01:17.259> modular<00:01:17.920> creation<00:01:18.670> system<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.119> these

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
great modular creation system with these

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.029 
great modular creation system with these
moon<00:01:19.420> base<00:01:19.659> pieces<00:01:20.079> so<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.619> can<00:01:20.740> go<00:01:20.829> ahead<00:01:20.920> and

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
moon base pieces so you can go ahead and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.819 
moon base pieces so you can go ahead and
build<00:01:21.249> out<00:01:21.429> well<00:01:21.759> mr.<00:01:22.350> corridors<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.649> things

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
build out well mr. corridors and things

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.200 
build out well mr. corridors and things
like<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.009> there's<00:01:24.579> also<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.789> ton<00:01:24.999> of<00:01:25.030> really
