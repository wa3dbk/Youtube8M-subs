00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.230 

the<00:01:08.830> thing<00:01:09.010> I've<00:01:09.130> learned<00:01:09.340> most<00:01:09.550> from<00:01:10.120> the

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
the thing I've learned most from the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.820 
the thing I've learned most from the
trail<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.380> can't<00:01:11.620> take

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
trail is that you just can't take

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.680 
trail is that you just can't take
anything<00:01:12.220> from<00:01:12.430> granted<00:01:12.970> when<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.150> comes<00:01:13.360> to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
anything from granted when it comes to

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.020 
anything from granted when it comes to
trail<00:01:14.080> running<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.470> New<00:01:14.620> Zealand<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
trail running in New Zealand some of the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.270 
trail running in New Zealand some of the
sections<00:01:16.450> which<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:17.020> look<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.800> map<00:01:18.010> and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
sections which you look on the map and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.000 
sections which you look on the map and
look<00:01:18.340> quite<00:01:19.300> simple<00:01:19.810> can<00:01:20.170> take<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.560> hours<00:01:20.800> and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
look quite simple can take you hours and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.850 
look quite simple can take you hours and
hours<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:22.660> just<00:01:22.900> can't<00:01:23.200> have<00:01:23.500> your<00:01:23.590> guard

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
hours and you just can't have your guard

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.490 
hours and you just can't have your guard
down<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.729> prepared<00:01:24.940> for<00:01:25.500> really

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
down you have to be prepared for really

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.800 
down you have to be prepared for really
really<00:01:26.830> tough<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.790> challenging<00:01:28.390> conditions

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
really tough and challenging conditions

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.620 
really tough and challenging conditions
throughout

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.150 

so<00:01:35.630> an<00:01:35.720> important<00:01:36.110> part<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.620> approach<00:01:36.890> I'm

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
so an important part of the approach I'm

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.330 
so an important part of the approach I'm
taking<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.760> trail<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.950> attempt<00:01:39.950> to

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
taking to the trail is to attempt to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370 
taking to the trail is to attempt to
cover<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> whole<00:01:41.210> distance<00:01:41.630> purely<00:01:42.110> under

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
cover the whole distance purely under

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.780 
cover the whole distance purely under
human<00:01:42.740> power<00:01:42.980> so<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.790> lot<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.540> trail<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.790> on

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
human power so a lot of the trail is on

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.330 
human power so a lot of the trail is on
foot<00:01:47.150> but<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:47.720> there's<00:01:48.200> water<00:01:48.590> components

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
foot but also there's water components

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.580 
foot but also there's water components
so<00:01:49.700> there<00:01:50.240> are<00:01:50.450> s3<00:01:51.020> crossings

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
so there are s3 crossings

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.130 
so there are s3 crossings
lakes<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.670> also<00:01:53.060> I'm<00:01:53.390> not<00:01:53.450> going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.840> attempt

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
lakes and also I'm not going to attempt

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.320 
lakes and also I'm not going to attempt
to<00:01:54.350> travel<00:01:54.979> across<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.370> Cook<00:01:55.729> Strait<00:01:56.000> between

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
to travel across the Cook Strait between

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:09.770 
to travel across the Cook Strait between
the<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:56.780> islands

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.340 

so<00:02:10.780> my<00:02:10.960> lifeline<00:02:11.500> on<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.420> terror<00:02:13.420> our<00:02:13.720> trail

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350
