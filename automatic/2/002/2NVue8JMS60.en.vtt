all looking pretty good the only thing I

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.140 
all looking pretty good the only thing I
really<00:00:23.630> worry<00:00:23.810> about<00:00:23.900> is<00:00:24.499> the<00:00:25.220> toolbox<00:00:25.939> that's

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
really worry about is the toolbox that's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.689 
really worry about is the toolbox that's
on<00:00:26.329> front<00:00:26.630> cuz<00:00:26.810> it's<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.109> huge<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.310> waste<00:00:28.550> of

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
on front cuz it's so huge and a waste of

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.190 
on front cuz it's so huge and a waste of
time<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:30.189> I'm<00:00:31.189> just<00:00:31.369> kind<00:00:31.579> of<00:00:32.050> sticking<00:00:33.050> back

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
time so I'm just kind of sticking back

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.190 
time so I'm just kind of sticking back
watching<00:00:33.500> everything<00:00:34.070> but<00:00:34.780> when<00:00:35.780> we<00:00:35.840> get<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.170> a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
watching everything but when we get to a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.319 
watching everything but when we get to a
lone<00:00:36.649> star<00:00:36.920> we'll<00:00:37.250> unload<00:00:37.609> it<00:00:37.789> into<00:00:38.059> its<00:00:38.180> new

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
lone star we'll unload it into its new

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.660 
lone star we'll unload it into its new
spot<00:00:38.660> which<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.289> going<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:39.440> be<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:39.620> much<00:00:40.160> smaller

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
spot which is going to be a much smaller

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.400 
spot which is going to be a much smaller
space<00:00:41.949> and<00:00:42.949> it's<00:00:43.250> more<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.640> a<00:00:44.350> how<00:00:45.350> to

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
space and it's more like a how to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.349 
space and it's more like a how to
explain<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:45.800> but<00:00:46.070> it's<00:00:46.550> kind<00:00:46.789> of<00:00:46.879> like<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.059> paint
