anyone who is curious and I know chips

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.580 
anyone who is curious and I know chips
may<00:02:15.830> be<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.160> hardest<00:02:16.340> thing<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:18.470> me

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
may be the hardest thing but for me

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.050 
may be the hardest thing but for me
they're<00:02:18.770> really<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.160> hard<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.520> eat<00:02:19.760> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
they're really not that hard to eat and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.550 
they're really not that hard to eat and
these<00:02:20.450> aren't<00:02:20.660> chips<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.140> normally<00:02:21.530> eat

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
these aren't chips that I normally eat

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.220 
these aren't chips that I normally eat
but<00:02:21.920> these<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.120> month<00:02:23.270> or<00:02:23.480> okay<00:02:24.200> so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
but these are just a month or okay so

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.290 
but these are just a month or okay so
they're<00:02:24.560> barbecue<00:02:25.310> chips<00:02:25.550> they're<00:02:25.910> kind<00:02:26.180> of

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
they're barbecue chips they're kind of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.750 
they're barbecue chips they're kind of
crisp<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.780> super<00:02:27.110> crisp<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.280> only<00:02:28.460> chips

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
crisp but not super crisp the only chips

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280 
crisp but not super crisp the only chips
I<00:02:28.880> would<00:02:29.030> recommend<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.540> cannot<00:02:30.050> really

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
I would recommend that I cannot really

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.230 
I would recommend that I cannot really
are<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.010> kettle<00:02:31.490> cooked<00:02:31.670> ones<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.120> these

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
are the kettle cooked ones because these

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.730 
are the kettle cooked ones because these
are<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.780> crisp<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.230> they<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:33.410> hard<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
are really crisp and they are hard to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.350 
are really crisp and they are hard to
eat<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.460> as<00:02:34.640> long<00:02:34.850> as<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> get<00:02:35.210> regular

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
take a bite of this egg I don't I didn't

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.340 
take a bite of this egg I don't I didn't
even<00:03:25.640> think<00:03:25.820> about<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.239> before<00:03:26.390> but<00:03:26.630> um<00:03:27.110> I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
even think about that before but um I

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.500 
even think about that before but um I
think<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.489> would<00:03:28.700> be<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:29.120> something<00:03:29.360> that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
think this would be like something that

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.850 
think this would be like something that
would<00:03:29.660> be<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:29.959> great<00:03:30.170> for<00:03:30.440> people<00:03:30.620> because

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
would be really great for people because

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.720 
would be really great for people because
it's<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.280> soft

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
it's so soft

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.000 
it's so soft
and<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.870> know<00:03:32.959> like<00:03:33.080> just<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.380> hard-boiled<00:03:33.650> egg

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
and you know like just a hard-boiled egg

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.630 
and you know like just a hard-boiled egg
or<00:03:34.370> deviled<00:03:35.090> eggs<00:03:35.180> whenever<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.190> this

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
or deviled eggs whenever so and this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.370 
or deviled eggs whenever so and this
thing<00:03:37.820> this<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.660> biggest<00:03:38.989> thing<00:03:39.110> about<00:03:39.200> how

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
thing this the biggest thing about how

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.930 
thing this the biggest thing about how
not<00:03:39.560> having<00:03:39.590> teeth<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.790> cause

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
not having teeth is this is it can cause

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.870 
not having teeth is this is it can cause
a<00:03:40.970> massive<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.510> doubled<00:03:42.019> egg<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.769> it's<00:03:43.670> not

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
a massive a doubled egg but it's not

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.680 
a massive a doubled egg but it's not
hard<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.150> eat<00:03:44.299> at<00:03:44.480> least<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.590> here<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.890> goes

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.750
