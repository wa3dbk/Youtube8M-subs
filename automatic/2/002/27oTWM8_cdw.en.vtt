is the spawn delay the spawn delays

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960 
is the spawn delay the spawn delays

seconds<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.279> fucking<00:00:26.699> nothing<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.960> fact<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
seconds is fucking nothing the fact is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.080 
seconds is fucking nothing the fact is
bottom<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.429> done<00:00:29.609> watching<00:00:29.849> your

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
bottom you got get done watching your

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.759 
bottom you got get done watching your
killcam<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.050> second<00:00:31.470> left<00:00:31.590> home

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
killcam you got one second left home

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.750 
killcam you got one second left home
like<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> spawn<00:00:32.279> delay<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:33.210> perfectly<00:00:33.899> fine

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
like a spawn delay it's perfectly fine

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
like a spawn delay it's perfectly fine
the<00:00:35.760> fact<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.630> gives<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the fact is it gives you a little bit of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.880 
the fact is it gives you a little bit of
a<00:00:37.980> leeway<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.870> team<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.770> get

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
a leeway to for team to get back or get

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
a leeway to for team to get back or get
a<00:00:40.950> B<00:00:41.129> flag<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.670> something<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> nature<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a B flag of something of that nature and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
a B flag of something of that nature and
if<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> strong<00:00:44.340> team<00:00:44.670> runs<00:00:45.390> rally<00:00:45.660> which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
if a strong team runs rally which

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.709 
if a strong team runs rally which
probably<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.890> happen<00:00:47.430> eventually<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.600> not

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
probably will happen eventually it's not

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170 
probably will happen eventually it's not
like<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> never<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> scenario<00:00:50.180> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
like you never run into that scenario it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840 
like you never run into that scenario it
would<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.989> no<00:00:52.230> different<00:00:52.710> than<00:00:53.100> killing<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
would be no different than killing you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.360 
would be no different than killing you
over<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:54.719> again<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.440> ac-130<00:00:56.129> and

not getting killed over and over again

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499 
not getting killed over and over again
you're<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.799> having<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> spawn<00:01:14.460> delay<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you're just having a spawn delay and you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
you're just having a spawn delay and you
having<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> disadvantage<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> objectives

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
having a disadvantage on the objectives

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
having a disadvantage on the objectives
mean<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> watch<00:01:18.060> them<00:01:18.330> harder<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
mean you got to watch them harder for a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
mean you got to watch them harder for a
night<00:01:19.619> kill<00:01:19.890> streak<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:21.090> enough

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
night kill streak it does it do enough

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.289 
night kill streak it does it do enough
and<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.619> fact<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.909> put<00:01:24.090> something

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and the fact is if you put something

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.380 
and the fact is if you put something
like<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.600> pavelow<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> nine<00:01:27.150> kill

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
like a pavelow to go on the nine kill

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
like a pavelow to go on the nine kill
streak<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> nice<00:01:28.080> big<00:01:28.350> ass<00:01:28.729> automated

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.430 
I mean you some some things like when
you<00:03:37.120> design<00:03:37.420> games<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.959> make<00:03:38.260> them

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you design games you have to make them

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.979 
you design games you have to make them
so<00:03:39.010> they<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.520> they<00:03:39.700> work<00:03:39.970> instead<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.810> just

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
so they so they work instead of just

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.979 
so they so they work instead of just
working<00:03:41.350> for<00:03:41.770> nobody<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:42.940> i<00:03:43.570> think

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
working for nobody because I i think

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.570 
working for nobody because I i think
this<00:03:44.080> you<00:03:44.230> integrate<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.709> quitting<00:03:45.100> system<00:03:45.459> as

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
this you integrate a quitting system as

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.150 
this you integrate a quitting system as
well<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:47.080> quitting<00:03:47.440> system<00:03:47.739> I've<00:03:47.860> said<00:03:48.040> it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
well the quitting system I've said it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.400 
well the quitting system I've said it
before<00:03:48.190> should<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.090> if<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.630> three<00:03:49.870> quit

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
before should be this if you three quit

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.760

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
three times in an hour a timer sets up

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.130 
three times in an hour a timer sets up

worth<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.060> video<00:04:16.180> games<00:04:16.630> online<00:04:17.489> before<00:04:18.489> that

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
worth of video games online before that

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.879 
worth of video games online before that
things<00:04:19.000> will<00:04:19.180> go<00:04:19.269> away<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:20.350> will<00:04:20.560> kind<00:04:20.709> of

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
things will go away this will kind of

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.900 
things will go away this will kind of
deter<00:04:21.220> people<00:04:21.459> from<00:04:21.790> quitting<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.419> game<00:04:22.600> and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
deter people from quitting the game and

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.159 
deter people from quitting the game and
I<00:04:24.910> think<00:04:25.060> that's<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.720> game<00:04:25.900> needs

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
I think that's what the game needs

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.110 
I think that's what the game needs
because<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.830> go<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.639> know<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.940> play

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.659 
because I go you know if you play
