see your should connect um one thing it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.910 
see your should connect um one thing it
does<00:03:26.389> take<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> little<00:03:27.019> while<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> connect<00:03:27.769> if

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
does take a little while to connect if

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.770 
does take a little while to connect if
you<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.160> slower<00:03:28.430> internet<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:29.510> mine

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.650 

like<00:03:32.780> my<00:03:32.810> router<00:03:33.260> all<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> way<00:03:33.680> downstairs<00:03:33.889> so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
like my router all the way downstairs so

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.349 
like my router all the way downstairs so
it'll<00:03:35.660> take<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.870> couple<00:03:35.900> seconds<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.970> going

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
it'll take a couple seconds to get going

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.780 
it'll take a couple seconds to get going
but<00:03:38.799> if<00:03:39.799> it<00:03:39.950> takes<00:03:40.040> too<00:03:40.190> long<00:03:40.280> I'll<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:40.639> cut

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
but if it takes too long I'll just cut

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.059 
but if it takes too long I'll just cut
this<00:03:40.819> part<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.269> video<00:03:41.510> out<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.470> we're<00:03:43.040> just

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
this part of the video out so we're just

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.319 
this part of the video out so we're just
waiting<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:46.160> shouldn't<00:03:46.760> take<00:03:46.790> any<00:03:47.090> more<00:03:47.269> than

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
waiting it shouldn't take any more than

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.780 
waiting it shouldn't take any more than
a<00:03:47.510> minute<00:03:47.870> if<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.650> does<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.010> turn<00:03:49.670> off

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
a minute if it does you just turn off

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.309 
a minute if it does you just turn off
your<00:03:49.819> Xbox<00:03:50.329> and<00:03:50.510> turn<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.810> right<00:03:50.900> back<00:03:51.019> on<00:03:51.170> it

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
your Xbox and turn it right back on it

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.629 
your Xbox and turn it right back on it
it<00:03:51.410> should<00:03:51.500> go<00:03:51.940> within<00:03:52.940> 10<00:03:53.180> seconds<00:03:53.569> or<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.720> but

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.949 

and<00:03:58.639> if<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:59.030> doesn't<00:03:59.329> work<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.540> first<00:03:59.569> time

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
and if it doesn't work the first time

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.210 
and if it doesn't work the first time
just<00:04:00.109> turn<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.470> off<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.739> try<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:00.980> again

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
just turn it off and try it again

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.650 
just turn it off and try it again
because<00:04:01.489> sometimes<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.660> takes<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:03.019> couple<00:04:04.660> look

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
because sometimes it takes a couple look

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.949 
because sometimes it takes a couple look
at<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.380> first<00:04:06.709> time<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.130> yeah<00:04:07.880> hope<00:04:08.870> you

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
at right the first time so yeah hope you
