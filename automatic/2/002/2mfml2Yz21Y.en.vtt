00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's nice but yeah stuff everywhere
that's<00:02:12.040> that's<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.519> bit<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:12.940> disappointment

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's that's a bit of a disappointment

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.900 
that's that's a bit of a disappointment
just<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.410> totally<00:02:14.890> honest<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.489> there's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
just to be totally honest this there's

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.670 
just to be totally honest this there's
really<00:02:16.120> nothing<00:02:16.510> special<00:02:16.810> about<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.410> at<00:02:17.530> all

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
really nothing special about that at all

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.490 
really nothing special about that at all
so<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.280> guess<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.629> try<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> Lille<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.349> end

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
so I guess we can try the Lille the end

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.620 
so I guess we can try the Lille the end
