00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 O 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.810
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 in today's video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.309
 how to make this tree that is doing 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.530
 the greatest success using materials that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.600
 Do you have at home some of you are going to have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.220
 what to buy but are very cheap 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.589
 you will see that it is worth giving a 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.190
 bit of work but the price is good 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.190
 little tiny 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.520
 So folks to start I cut 20 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 pieces of wire 10 with 45 centimeters and 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.010
 10 to 55 but this does not affect in 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.350
 nothing on the tree has seen this color wire 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.839
 I bought a roll of wire and paid $ 12 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.780
 law more than 30 meters then yields 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.310
 enough to start riding the tree 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.260
 people are very simple 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.590
 You will join them all, only put 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.300
 right the dots down after I 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.600
 I'm going to measure about four-five 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.790
 Fingers I'm going to let my foot do it 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.940
 so the tree is secure 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.300
 inside the vessel and the other four fingers 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.979
 I'm going to pass on the electrical tape that's 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.539
 hold on and firmly so I can 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.539
 do the rest of the tree 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.000
 now I'm going to start formatting the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.740
 here you do not have to do the same 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 creativity of each of you do. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.780
 a format that you want I just go 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.420
 give the tips for you to put the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.140
 branches and such but the format you are 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.370
 they decide 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.159
 the good and to give the format is very 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.110
 simple I'm going to pull some wires to 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.050
 the side here I got a 4 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.060
 I took one of them and rolled over 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.690
 others to be together 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.310
 then the stadium is a pleasure every time 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 twig where each flower will be 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.360
 I'll come back later and remember what's left. 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.430
 and when I thought I had little use of years 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.709
 they stayed there to put the flowers 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.739
 So I'm taking these wires that 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.209
 left at the tips and was 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.950
 coiling they will stay up a little 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.110
 Alone, but no problem, then . 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.480
 allows you to see the insulation tape there 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.519
 right and in its place and after it all 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.590
 the will and stayed like I said 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.030
 each uses his creativity mounts of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.239
 any way you want 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 if you watch her little foot I 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.590
 I doubled everything up to be more 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.280
 easy to fit and secure 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 inside the vessel 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.260
 now it's time to fit the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.450
 winking people in the middle I left 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.650
 very little cold here left to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.239
 arrive at the formed 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.250
 I advise you to leave more 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.739
 because mine used to need me 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.360
 extension 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.160
 this part is very simple to do 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.760
 It's kind of annoying because it takes a while. 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.430
 But it's very simple, we'll even go. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.250
 pick the search lines that fit 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.350
 at the end of each year will be 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.640
 leaving some neighbors in the middle but 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.739
 is no problem then we will 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.430
 playing insulation tape will cover her and 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.620
 she will not even appear and to hold the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.200
 in the place I 'm putting pieces of 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.269
 insulation tape at the point where 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.519
 will be in the middle I'm a team just to go 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.170
 holding more or less because then the 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.459
 People will see you wrapping the electrical tape 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.459
 and will insure everything 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.980
 Look how's going to stay, will you play? 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.360
 a shooter and you can not understand much 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.360
 But I promise you give blood. 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.879
 And to finish it if there is a little bit of 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.200
 flashes is good that goes up better 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.739
 what is missing, right? 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.250
 So just get what's left and I'm 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.080
 and placing a tree trunk in the tree 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:19.209
 tree because after we go through 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:21.400
 by the steering wheel will cover good now arrived 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.830
 turn to turn to stay with 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.229
 tree face on the street and now it 's very 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.660
 simple is just hooding kafitu insulating 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.090
 That's it. 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.280
 be careful with those little lights that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.500
 they were in the middle of the tree for you 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.639
 get well they do not they will appear to 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.639
 what time was it in vienna 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.580
 and looks just play paid're already giving up 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.580
 to imagine how it's going to be, huh? 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.960
 And for our tree to stand, I'm going 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.419
 put her in the bar and another 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.010
 town I'm going to put clay first 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.370
 put some of today and then I 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.919
 I'm in charge and I put more and 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.690
 give the finishing of some pebbles I 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.919
 play on the white pebbles but you 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.919
 You can choose what you want. 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.940
 The coolest of this tree people is what 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.550
 We'll use it to make the kitchens. 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.780
 what is nothing more nothing less than bottle 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.660
 pet 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.310
 I'm going to cut several little flowers in the 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.170
 so simple mold knows that 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.480
 flower people learn doing school 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.480
 that has five balls that same 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.310
 cut flowers 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.770
 now let's stick to the ones to fit the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.300
 Luis, I'm going to use this one for me. 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.490
 will work had to fit 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.310
 Little thing then you have to measure the light 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.310
 What do you have to find something 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.460
 nail screw that you can stick and stick 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.070
 and I warm it up in the candle and then 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.430
 8 a little flower 25 just be careful to 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.430
 do not get burned 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.880
 now the people to give the format that I 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.940
 I want in bloom I'll use the dryer 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.820
 I'll call him and put a flower in the 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.080
 in the hot air and I'm shaping it 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.720
 The way I want it and she looks at it already 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.240
 now to finish this tree right now 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.520
 For this I will use the instant glue I 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.040
 I'll put a little bit around the 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.510
 hole and the plug in the neighbor is 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:57.520
 very simple 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.520
 I hope to get a little bit ready 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.290
 and there is the result of our tree 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.590
 Who says these chubby ones are? 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.210
 made of bottle pet in the same as mine 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.400
 tree as you can see is missing 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.040
 some little flowers that the pet bottle that 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.620
 I had not given it but no problem 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.170
 What's the point is the intention, and you can see 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.090
 well the result of how the 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.740
 blinks I used is this colorful 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.530
 I did not have white I wanted to do a lot 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.480
 blank but I did not 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.720
 but you can use what you 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.590
 I wish and I loved it so all 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.390
 colorful 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.000
 just look at the mine is also one who gives 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:46.410
 for you to leave flashing of several 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.900
 ways and also leave and without flashing 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.420
 So there goes of each one and it is you use that 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.180
 are you at home or are you 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.740
 creativity of yours and that's it 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.650
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.030
 if you like or click I always liked 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.870
 leading the channel 

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.710
 follow the blog follow facebook it integrates 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.420
 and everything else
