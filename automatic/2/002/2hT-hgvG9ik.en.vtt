forward<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.969> I've<00:00:15.240> built<00:00:15.509> previously

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
forward to this I've built previously

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.700 
forward to this I've built previously
the<00:00:16.980> version<00:00:17.490> four<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.970> eighteen<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the version four if eighteen and the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.330 
the version four if eighteen and the
issue<00:00:20.029> 34<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.269> I<00:00:21.449> love<00:00:21.929> flying<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.650> this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
issue 34 which I love flying and this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.099 
issue 34 which I love flying and this
one<00:00:23.519> promises<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> step<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:24.960> me<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
one promises to be a step up for me a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
one promises to be a step up for me a
faster<00:00:25.679> plane<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.089> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.269> will

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
faster plane and one which I think will

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
faster plane and one which I think will
test<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.109> my<00:00:28.170> reflexes<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> flying<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> little

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
test out my reflexes and flying a little

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.909 
test out my reflexes and flying a little
bit<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.660> I'm<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.109> looking<00:00:31.259> forward<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
bit but I'm really looking forward to

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.010 
bit but I'm really looking forward to
flying<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.400> I've<00:00:32.970> painted<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
flying it I've painted it up in the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
flying it I've painted it up in the
color<00:00:34.500> scheme<00:00:34.830> that<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.130> used<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:36.060> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

there and in that sort of Arrowhead
shape<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:54.330> which<00:00:54.750> looks<00:00:54.990> terrific<00:00:55.560> on<00:00:55.950> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
shape there which looks terrific on the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.010 
shape there which looks terrific on the
airplane<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.640> should<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.210> easy<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.630> see<00:00:57.810> in<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
airplane as should be easy to see in the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.870

air<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.220> throw<00:00:59.400> it<00:00:59.580> into<00:00:59.700> the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
air and we're gonna throw it into the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
air very soon and see how it flies okay

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
here we go maiden flight for the RC

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:21.230 
here we go maiden flight for the RC
Powers<00:01:05.729> mig-29<00:01:06.630> version<00:01:07.049> for

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.420 

okay<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.410> launched<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> wind<00:01:23.130> comes

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
okay just as I launched the wind comes

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
okay just as I launched the wind comes
up<00:01:23.780> terrific<00:01:25.010> just<00:01:26.010> what<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.370> need<00:01:26.550> on<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
up terrific just what you need on a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.620 
up terrific just what you need on a
minor<00:01:27.450> plot

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.260 

and<00:01:34.630> that's<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.990> about<00:01:35.079> 3/4<00:01:35.890> throttle<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
and that's it about 3/4 throttle and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
and that's it about 3/4 throttle and
with<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.520> turnigy<00:01:40.920> 2826

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:54.389 

2200<00:01:46.110> kV<00:01:47.110> motor<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.789> that's<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.189> is

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
2200 kV motor and that's that now is

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.069 
2200 kV motor and that's that now is
only<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:54.819> half<00:01:54.880> throttle<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:55.659> that's<00:01:55.840> fast

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
only about half throttle so that's fast

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.199 
only about half throttle so that's fast
enough<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:56.560> me<00:01:56.679> for<00:01:56.709> the<00:01:56.950> moment<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.179> a

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
enough for me for the moment I do have a

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.959 
enough for me for the moment I do have a
beefier<00:01:58.659> motor<00:01:58.979> which<00:01:59.979> I'll<00:02:00.159> install<00:02:00.610> once<00:02:00.850> I

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
beefier motor which I'll install once I

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.020 
beefier motor which I'll install once I
get<00:02:01.209> comfortable<00:02:01.810> with<00:02:02.079> this<00:02:02.259> thing<00:02:03.030> let's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
get comfortable with this thing let's

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.080 
get comfortable with this thing let's
just<00:02:04.240> try<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> little<00:02:04.479> faster

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.580 

wow<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:15.280> thing<00:02:15.390> barely<00:02:16.390> scoots<00:02:16.870> along

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
wow that thing barely scoots along

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.420 
wow that thing barely scoots along
I<00:02:17.730> can't<00:02:18.730> imagine<00:02:18.819> handle<00:02:19.420> go<00:02:19.569> with<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> NT<00:02:20.230> in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
I can't imagine handle go with the NT in

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
I can't imagine handle go with the NT in
2700<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.550> board

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.910 

that's<00:02:34.440> brilliant<00:02:35.420> love<00:02:36.420> it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.040 

just<00:02:40.920> slow<00:02:41.099> down<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> little<00:02:41.550> now<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.180> heart

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.220 

see<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.049> flies<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.620> well<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:15.340> tracks<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:17.049> an

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
see that flies so well it tracks like an
