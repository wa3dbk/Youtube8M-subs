00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.280
Building stunning waterfalls is made easier
with the Eco-Series Universal Waterfall Diffuser,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.469
the original compact waterfall spillway.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.240
Its compact size, incredible strength and
innovative design make it one of the most

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.960
popular and versatile waterfall spillways
available.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.410
The diffuser's load bearing design allows
block or rock to be stacked directly on top

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.099
for easy concealment.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.640
These units are available in single 16" and
23" widths or dual 32" and 46" widths.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.539
Multiple spillways can be added together for
custom applications.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.089
The diffuser works by depressurizing incoming
water as it passes over the internal baffles.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.309
This creates an even flow of water at the
start of the falls.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.929
The universal waterfall diffuser is easy to
install.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.270
Thread the male adapter into the desired inlet
and thread the plug into the opposite, unused

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.820
inlet.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.520
Set the diffuser or diffusers into their final
position and use PVC glue to secure the 2"

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520
supply line.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.720
Wrap the waterfall or stream liner over the
top and secure the assembly with your choice

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.820
of landscape materials.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:29.110
No liner penetration is necessary for installation.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:42.580
The addition of the 23" copper spillway attachment
creates a decorative water feature for use

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.000
in block walls.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.820

and waterfalls or formal water features, your

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.480
