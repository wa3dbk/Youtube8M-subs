00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 I would like to take pictures on changing wheels. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 This is the original wheel now 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 In general, I use the same amount of power, but I use the cycle computer just in case 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Speed, let's see ... 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Yes, I will live. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Good! 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is about 10 kg. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Yes, I almost stopped 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Is it here? 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Eh ... about 1 minute 50 seconds or something like this 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I'm looking forward to what kind of monday will be after changing. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.066
 Well, it is the measurement of the wheel after replacement. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 This is an aluminum rim but maybe it will be shorter. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Then let's measure ... Good 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 It is a little late, maybe 10.3 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 I feel that it's light by hand, though it's light 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 What kind of thing ... 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Hmm 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It's about ... 1 minute 40 seconds? 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Hm, considering that the speed was slow, it would have been around here 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Well, I guess there is an effect. ···Yes 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Ummm, I think that there is no big difference in the actual run. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 As the weight of the bicycle is a city cycle, it is nearly 25 km. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 It may not change so much ... but it is a tuning charingo emotionally. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Then, I would like to measure it if something comes back next time 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 The rear wheels are geared, so it looks like they're going to change ... I'm sorry ... I'm ...
