00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.880
 you want to know who can do the whole 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 teams takes apart then that is 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 exactly the right one here 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.520
 and welcome to the 23rd book 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.160
 I have not presented any hello 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.230
 I know the press and now 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.419
 I know you all ok well we will be you 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.210
 today or I mean of course I will 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.189
 imagine today consisting of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.660
 first generation comes and types 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.550
 Fire is who did not know that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.640
 Now you are ready for life and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.800
 plakativ owns three skills once 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.230
 we have four fingers with rest and the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.300
 hidden capacity will righteousness 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.739
 all this ability not know the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 he explains for a very short time 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.149
 and we have a finger before 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 which strengthens the holidays of akg 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.309
 when it comes from an attack of the type fire 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.559
 is then hit which the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.899
 Attack from the opponent lowers and the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.449
 hidden ability honesty which 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.699
 the attack to a level blows soon 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.780
 ak never an attack of the type and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.670
 was not hit 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 Now let's have a look at the base 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 values ​​of arcania once we have one 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.080
 base kp worth of 90 a physical 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.360
 Attack value of 110 defense as well 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.820
 Special defense amounts to both 80 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.220
 the special grip is 100 thus also 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.930
 relatively good as a special hacker 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.820
 So the initiative is not 95 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.270
 the most initiative but it can be 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 also very good as a chamber play cani 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.670
 own three debilitates once water 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.680
 then ground and rock all three types 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.070
 you really like to see complete display 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.050
 but still you can do that relatively well 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.240
 act when you have a good choir 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.240
 and thus can be so I can be very 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 play well in july meter and it would be 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.140
 maybe aka never knows very much 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 play variable over physically defensive 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.430
 too offensive and most of them 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
 the whole standard moves of ak never 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.960
 know how the election office or as I said 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.060
 the physical defensive I want you 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.119
 to present a very special book 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.700
 that is that mixa i can said this 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.860
 book includes the following attacks once 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.430
 the heat koller then the turbo tempo 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.080
 Flamm lightning and melee first to the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.450
 attacks why the whole thing 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.670
 we want to play a mixed one here because 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.740
 You probably know the ju meter there 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 you have some states like for example 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.920
 presents 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.860
 which, of course, from a flame 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.319
 but lightning code will be what the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.270
 the advantage is that you then the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.980
 This does not get the whole recall 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.709
 yes has a third through flames lightning 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.540
 the damage recoil then like times 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.810
 lift the ground and that's how you do it 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.180
 heat collapse 2 -2 special attack gets 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.230
 but a lot of damage and where is 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 then enough for a car 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.599
 or it brings the water 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.120
 on the robustness down and also in the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.580
 obi meter , there are pokémon like aunt 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.410
 and panzer roll you very much 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 likes to see and for that is the heat 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.519
 koller also very very good that's why I 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.200
 this would very much like to play games and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.360
 turbo tempo is very clear we want 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.640
 the priority so that we have a +2 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 Priority so it is very very 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 advantageous then you can again the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.269
 take flames lightning as a second step 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.890
 but you can also for water types 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.560
 Strom shot next to that remains to you 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.780
 leave and then last but not least 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.730
 we the melee because melee is always 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.459
 a very good camera attack on ak never 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.650
 become because you spoke design as well 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.570
 can meet and therefore we have too 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.280
 Once again a nice coverage comes 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.100
 me also directly to the evs become the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.549
 Once distributed as 252 in the following 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.430
 attack 252 in the initiative and four 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.950
 in the special attack then we play 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.859
 been with a hasty which the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.560
 inet posts by 10% and the defense 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.870
 reduced by ten percent with the old one 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.690
 living place and ability with rom 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.489
 plays a hasty thing here because we 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.920
 by the threatening the attack of 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.480
 lower opponents and thus the physical 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.090
 Defense is not so strong anymore 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.100
 is needed and that's why we can 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.380
 been the haste here to play what I 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.790
 really good with the amount 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.850
 we can then do all the physical 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.260
 overcome the field of the pokémon 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.090
 physical attacks is very important and 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.190
 if it is at minus 1 then change 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.780
 the opponents mostly out and thus can 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.669
 you play very well on the cani 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.060
 by this mixtape it can be stopped 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.919
 synonymous relatively clean copy without now 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.240
 to always get a lot of recoil 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.340
 by flame flash of golden helmet 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.060
 that's why i really need you this 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.650
 heart 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.300
 Of course you can continue that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.909
 was bands et or physically defensive 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.200
 play or special offensive if 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.610
 you like that is up to you 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.259
 means at all 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.389
