00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 chapter on angles the essential one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.590
 angle is a portion of plans 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.920
 bounded by two half- right here from 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.920
 same origin 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:33.210
 this origin on May 2nd right is called 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:38.760
 also vertex the angle is here we can 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 name this angle so giving a name 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.590
 at the points at the top if we take the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 high point and that one soul and 2003 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 allying with them there is a bone x then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.379
 the angle and x or y 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.379
 we go x with a hat on it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:19.180
 in a triangle here so we have the point 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 there point b we note the orange angle to 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:31.300
 dawns and bo with a little hat 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:34.690
 does not matter the meaning where we can also in a 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.220
 lowered triangle for example name 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.000
 every angle only by a letter 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.660
 since there can not be 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.780
 possible confusion while in 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:59.229
 the previous example the angle to could 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:02.979
 be as this one that also rising 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.600
 huila or that one whereas here there is 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.500
 no choice 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.820
 since we are in the triangle the angle 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.090
 from the stove is only one in the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.480
 CSU triangle one as there is a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.060
 angle from point c is an angle he 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.230
 was the point b the reporter their 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.470
 bringing is a corner measuring tool 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.320
 so it allows if the reporter is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.290
 graduated andrÃ©e to measure tongue in 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.680
 tomorrow so this reporter is divided into 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:47.640
 5 81 equal parts 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 each graduation represents a degree 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 so a double and a graduation that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.260
 bigger it's 5 is still a 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 bigger this makes 10 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.930
 so this angle measure just read on 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.970
 a carrier from 0 to 60 5 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.970
 here it's sixty five degrees 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:30.020
 what kind of angle is waiting for an angle like 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.550
 that such as smaller than 90 degrees 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.480
 that is, smaller than an angle 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.630
 right is called an acute angle 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.680
 so then we at the right angle he 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.510
 must 90 degrees obtuse lang which is worth more 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:55.250
 of 90 and less than a flat angle that is 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:58.600
 180 votes the language of dishes the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.610
 bisector the bisector of an angle 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:06.830
 it's the right who share an angle 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.110
 in two superimposable angles that we 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.360
 reminds of something 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.810
 of course to the axis of symmetry it wants 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.310
 to say that the bisector is actually 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.310
 the language symmetry axis 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.560
 let's go back to the triangle the triangles so 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.480
 we have right triangles with a 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.669
 right angle 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.880
 the isosceles triangle the angles to the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.880
 based 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:48.730
 his ego is here it's the axis of symmetry 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:54.250
 the mediator of the base or the 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:05:02.710
 median and the equilateral triangle to 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:04.060
 all its angles of the same extent with respect to 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.310
 concerns the right angles of the creators 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.320
 let's see for the rhombus 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.139
 the diamond as it has its diagonals 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.710
 being of axis of symmetry these diagonals 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:27.400
 so this shares the angles these two 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:30.910
 angles here in two so same way and 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.320
 will share weapons here island is this 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.169
 What's more, it's that angles 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.840
 opposite since it is an access 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.020
 dissymmetry these two years without news 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.020
 measured 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.419
 so we say that the opposite angles are 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.419
 same measures 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:06.900
 and so that the diagonals sound 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.900
 bisector of these simple
