00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.040
 explain the first one is player against 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.600
 beast or motorcycle or animal in this 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.310
 then you will enter is to fight 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.610
 against said and level up and does not go 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:10.600
 to fight so much against the other side in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 pvp explayar versus player will enter 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.500
 then to a combat always with the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.030
 other players with the villains or the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 heroes depending on the group that you 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 choose and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.110
 they can also obviously level up 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 but it will be more focused on a fight between 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.310
 you as I already have player versus move 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.870
 I will be selected then 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.650
 player versus player we go to the fight 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.650
 and load 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.550
 good this is the video boys of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.870
 intro but we will not jump it is a 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.080
 a little bit long I recommend that you 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.080
 see 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 Light 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.210
 good in this selection to you 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.860
 they have been selected as a man or a woman 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 preference selections well if they are 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.980
 men or men then you will see is your 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.320
 decision 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.470
 already as they heard mister thiago if they have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
 another inclination do what you want 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 good boys this is to select the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.280
 man 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.750
 in this selection you select 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.920
 what kind of body do they want for their 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 character if they want it small 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.850
 This is more or less like mister thiago 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.640
 ribera that I have it here next 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 I could do something like this 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:35.120
 but you prefer to take the striker march 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:37.970
 improve combat attitudes in this 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.460
 selection you and the elections if you 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.860
 they want to do just or if they want 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.230
 do inspired by some character in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.300
 special that I told them then 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.620
 you prefer is to enter the game 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.870
 you want yes that is, I do not want 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.850
 do exactly like superman ok metan 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.890
 they have been inspired there they are going to have a 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.760
 very long selection of characters to the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.070
 who want to access 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.650
 I prefer custom since if I want 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.330
 make me some modifications or something in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.360
 this selection you will select if 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.170
 they want to be heroes or villains 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.830
 depending as on the side of that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.830
 you feel 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.470
 but the lady talking in these 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 elections you already select if 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
 they want to be in the position of 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.760
 can be already animal or 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.200
 and entrabado as well as santiago good 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.200
 let's go for food 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.810
 superman avant model then depending 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.879
 of what you want I prefer 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.989
 superman or I like it more as attack and 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:55.659
 gates 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:00.970
 gadgets objects or something special 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:03.190
 I'm going to select ice in the last 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.489
 selections select if they want to be 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.440
 with super speed acrobatics or flight 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.329
 what I want to talk about because running 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.450
 all over the map is somewhat tedious and 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.450
 boring 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:23.979
 Jolines Archer Broun is like fighting 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.539
 listen to maximum dual power guns and the 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.850
 skills change according to which you 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.440
 want to see how very long 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.669
 the option that they can have there are some that 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.050
 are blocked that are why 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.050
 should pay notice 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.139
 Texas 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.529
 and their parties only have to 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.659
 go down to next or re - customize 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.620
 the other time to select what they want 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:57.139
 do then let's go to next 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.240
 if I want to create it 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.639
 and here you select for example 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.699
 the body the face as they want it if the 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.590
 they want nice pretty pretty people with 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.129

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.129
 With glasses 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.919
 face 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.470
 let's put this one that is like the one you see 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.610
 as weirder if you load the game some 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.129
 day 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.400

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:27.270
 the form of modification there are some very 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.270
 Interesting 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.650
 let's leave it as well as the most normal 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.610
 you can see in this game that they're going 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.500
 to see very strange things 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.060
