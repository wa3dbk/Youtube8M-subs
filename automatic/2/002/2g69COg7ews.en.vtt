00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.699
 thing of logo with my guy says 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.080
 if this very promising so here is me 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.400
 I called this guy there because the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.779
 work he proposes it's really this 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.060
 that I too want to propose 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.289
 there is only one small nuance between him 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.630
 and I think he has a little style 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.150
 more African I would say me a style a 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.089
 little more Caribbean but otherwise work 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.480
 it's the same basically are in good visual 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.730
 also with doggie dance etc the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.610
 artists who can produce a sound and 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 also have an effective visual with 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.010
 dancing with everything you need 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.019
 the theme of miscegenation 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.329

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.370

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.460
 world is mixing so it's really a 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.860
 theme that touches me everyone 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.450

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.649

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.030
 if the better these half-breeds the same words music 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.979

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.400

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.220
