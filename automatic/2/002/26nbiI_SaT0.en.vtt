exploration<00:01:23.100> through<00:01:23.220> our<00:01:23.340> maps<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.420> have

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
exploration through our maps so we have

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.330 
exploration through our maps so we have
a<00:01:24.720> number<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.260> weapon<00:01:25.710> points<00:01:26.040> dotted

a number of weapon points dotted

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
a number of weapon points dotted
throughout<00:01:26.490> our<00:01:26.790> map<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.900> then

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
throughout our map which you can then

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.620

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
can be found in safe areas of the map

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.000 
can be found in safe areas of the map
where<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.480> know<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.720> run<00:01:39.930> round<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.800> have

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
where you you know we run round you have

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.040 
where you you know we run round you have
less<00:01:41.250> chance<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.730> encounter<00:01:41.820> an<00:01:42.150> enemy<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.930> you

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
less chance to encounter an enemy if you

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.540 
less chance to encounter an enemy if you
want<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.320> biggest<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> best<00:01:43.950> weapons<00:01:44.370> such

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
want the biggest and best weapons such

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.520 
want the biggest and best weapons such

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
as the carbine assault rifles or LMGs

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
as the carbine assault rifles or LMGs
you<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.310> need<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:48.000> dangerous

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you really need to go to more dangerous

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
you really need to go to more dangerous
areas<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.990> need<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> flag<00:01:49.800> points

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
areas you need to go to the flag points

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.790 
areas you need to go to the flag points
and<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.550> like<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.030> open<00:01:51.360> zones<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.110> really

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
and to like the open zones and really

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800 
and to like the open zones and really
sort<00:01:53.010> of<00:01:53.040> risk<00:01:53.250> yourself<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
sort of risk yourself to get these so it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.800 
sort of risk yourself to get these so it
really<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> risk<00:01:55.560> versus<00:01:55.890> reward<00:01:55.979> gameplay

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
really is a risk versus reward gameplay

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.570 
really is a risk versus reward gameplay
scavengers<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.440> hard<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.160> conquest

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
scavengers also take hard and conquest

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.359 
scavengers also take hard and conquest
domination<00:01:59.900> so<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.619> reason<00:02:01.770> we've<00:02:02.040> gone<00:02:02.220> for

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
domination so the reason we've gone for

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.890 
domination so the reason we've gone for
this<00:02:02.580> mode<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> helps<00:02:03.690> focus

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
this mode is because it helps focus

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.290 
this mode is because it helps focus
people<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.440> certain<00:02:04.740> areas<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.550> with<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> Dom

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
people in certain areas and with the Dom

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.969 
people in certain areas and with the Dom
neisha<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.720> opposed<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.170> normal<00:02:07.350> conquest

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
neisha as opposed to normal conquest

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.340 
neisha as opposed to normal conquest
it's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.729> faster<00:02:08.940> game<00:02:09.270> played<00:02:09.479> two<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
it's a much faster game played two to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.520 
it's a much faster game played two to
actually<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.700> scavenger<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:13.260> really

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually have so scavenger was really

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.370 
actually have so scavenger was really
inspired<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:15.570> aftermath<00:02:16.050> theme

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
inspired from the the aftermath theme

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.050 
inspired from the the aftermath theme
you<00:02:16.709> know<00:02:16.740> weeks<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.400> imagine<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.030> our

normal equipment it will come lost in

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.240 
normal equipment it will come lost in
amongst<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> rubble<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.650> really<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.660 

so<00:02:56.810> why<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.349> first-person<00:02:57.829> shooters<00:02:58.220> abandon

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
exactly why this is because it is a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.559
