flashback set or the throwbacks it I'm
kind<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.239> losing<00:03:45.390> toward<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.680> flashback

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190

section<00:03:47.519> cuz<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.970> flashbacks<00:03:48.480> born

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780

section cuz I like flashbacks born
general<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.769> there's<00:03:49.980> more<00:03:50.100> value

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
general and I think there's more value

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.400 
general and I think there's more value
that<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.670> come<00:03:50.880> from<00:03:50.910> them<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> nylon

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
that can come from them but that nylon

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.590 
that can come from them but that nylon
over<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.190> our<00:03:53.310> bowmen<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.910> looks

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
over all of our bowmen it looks

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.010 
over all of our bowmen it looks
so<00:03:54.960> eventually<00:03:55.740> we'll<00:03:56.010> probably<00:03:56.190> do<00:03:56.370> both<00:03:56.640> um

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020
