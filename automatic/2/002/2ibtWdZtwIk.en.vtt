00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.740
 let's look inside the engine after 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.280
 when the oil is poured into the system 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.080
 grease 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.389
 it completely fills the engine crankcase 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 and through the channels comes to oil 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 the pump that passes it through 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 filter as an example let's take 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 four cylinder petrol engine 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.680
 since today it is he 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 is one of the most successful and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 popular models filter task 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 remove particles from the oil 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 sediment accumulating in it in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 engine running 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.770
 from the filter oil is fed to the crank 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 shaft and lubricate the bearings and then 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 sprayed on the bottom of the piston and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 cylinder walls cooling and protecting them 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.350
 further oil rises through the channels 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.399
 top of the engine and lubricate 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.500
 camshaft 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.010
 provides soft work of pushers 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 Valves when using oils are fine 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.449
 sediment particles and oxidation products and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.520
 fuel combustion accumulate on 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.070
 saw the surfaces of engine parts 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.710
 varnish and soot 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.170
 begins the process of wear as 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 engine pollution oxidizes faster 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.760
 and the oil itself changes its viscosity in 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 the result 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.170
 oil loses ability reliably 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 protect the most important parts of the engine 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.560
 important role in the operation of the cylinder-piston 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.300
 engine groups 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.770
 play piston rings they don't 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.020
 miss formed during combustion 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.030
 fuels gases and prevent them 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.070
 oil penetration in piston grooves 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 rings accumulates high temperature 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.880
 surface deposits 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.100
 becomes bumpy and gases leak out 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.560
 down into the lubrication system through 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.240
 resulting leaks being in 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.800
 Sump sour products 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.750
 and fuel oxidation 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.940
 oxidize oil resulting in loss 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.160
 effective motor protection active 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.350
 detergent masses keep grooves 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.910
 piston rings clean thanks to this 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.340
 rings provide reliable sealing 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.560
 and tightness and do not let gases in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.950
 engine cards are well protected up to 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 up the trail
