00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.779
 the kitchen is usually the centerpiece in the 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.670
 household many suppliers and the constant 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.530
 technological advances are 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 but a challenge for the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 Customers like to plan which materials 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.550
 choose what should the devices can etc 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 Etc 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.940
 a contemporary modern kitchen draws 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.280
 especially from that much 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.540
 Work surface has between sink and fro 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700
 that is a very important one 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.310
 that maybe that 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.099
 extractor hood is integrated in the hob 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 that we very often implement that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.460
 appliances steamer completely on the cadre 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 are used and that also goes straight 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.270
 Continue with the energy efficiency that you have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.520
 just in this area looks like that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.020
 the energy efficiency is very high 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
 when it comes to refrigerators and merely or 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.030
 baker players double plus on it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 you should pay attention 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 kitchens cost the more important the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.110
 Proper budget planning we ask in the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.910
 kitchen planning very early 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.220
 this budget as well as on the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.480
 to ask questions and know if that 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.180
 now in the budget is still possible 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.200
 or not for example instead of one 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 plastic plate of a flagstone too 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 do 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 expensive stone plates or something 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 choose cheaper 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.790
 standing by it would be important to me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.710
 that is an Austrian stand 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 granite for example very 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 resistant very robust of course 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.090
 is art standing in the last time 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.760
 more and more often and make it very much 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 good because it is very resistant 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.880
 and because it's a bit cheaper than 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.710
 put and at the normal 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.250
 Worktops have been around 40 50 years 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.970
 years proven resopal surfaces in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.220
 all colors always fit and solid wood 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.540
 is known as the most robust and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 most long-term material 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.130
 the beneficial solid wood face 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.530
 what photos you antibacterial and it would be 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.990
 Sometimes the important thing is to be understood 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.060
 that the excerpts go all the way out 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710
 The store should also be self again 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.659
 revoke 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.799
 It should be quiet and it should 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 the strength and resilience 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.600
 So at least 30 kilograms per rail 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.750
 not political but per rail 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.619
 It should be a good one here 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.959
 especially fogged at one 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.560
 Austrian cuisine 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.870
 in any case meet 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.459
 Clever practical systems can do that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.099
 everyday life much easier 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.160
 So research and compare exactly 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.750
 and get all the tips of the professional planner 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.790
 It is very important to the kitchen 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.410
 Pay attention to your workplace there 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.880
 Find where you like to be in the kitchen 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.459
 that means that i belong to my family 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.800
 see that I see in the light that it is the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.110
 best workplace in the kitchen as are 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.500
 which aspects also concern guarantees 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.420
 and reliability of the offering companies 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.010
 funeral today usual five years 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.989
 to have full warranty 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.850
 For kitchens, it is usually ten years 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.630
 to have full warranty on the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.260
 materials 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.090
 Of course something can happen but in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.819
 good kitchen maker a good one 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.239
 domestic kitchen manufacturers teams long 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.660
 gives 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.340
 Of course it works for a good one 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.870
 quality 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.330
 before you have to start right 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.349
 actually only the appropriate one 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.930
 kitchen planner can be found 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.310
 the first criterion is that you do that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.690
 I think that is rather sympathetic 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 one of the most important criteria 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.130
 then it is of course important that one 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.320
 proper needs analysis does and what 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.079
 We at home are very appreciated

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.890
 cook yourself because if you do not yourself

 can cook, it is difficult to someone 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.420
 explain how cooking works
