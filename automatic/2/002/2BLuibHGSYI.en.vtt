00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.950
 but 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.800
 but not 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.180
 what I like the most about the house 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.810
 first the area 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.210
 towards the mountain but at the same time it is very 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.210
 near the center then you have like 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 what access to the inside as is a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 building of the years 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.550
 a good dining room a good room are already 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.890
 the rooms the view from one side is towards 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.680
 the highway but it does not make noise and towards 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.979
 rooms facing the street does not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.979
 noise 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.140
 you have to adapt yourself 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.900
 and I enjoy all areas 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.630
 not everything sometimes in the room times in the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.630
 what 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 is to put my anemic mind to bed 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.090
 14 years 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.659
 disconnect 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 I have a tree very close 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.210
 I can now go to her sometimes sack 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 blanket 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.670
 contemplating laws 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.860
 I do not have that privilege, not blood 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.970
 the florist 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.190
 let's do the florists if I do not buy 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.690
 flowers as such I buy petals from 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.770
 roses 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.770
 and threw them all over the room 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140
 what 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.100
 the first thing that can not be missing in my 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.520
 home is chocolate 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.250
 I can die, I can go hungry 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.090
 remove the coffee right now I'm transition 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.760
 annual 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.430
 or the meat 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.349
 it was not easy it's fine here is the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.349
 chocolate we can kill someone 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.980
 good place the ideal has to have 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.980
 harmony 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.760
 it is of understanding tolerance nothing worse 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.150
 that a beautiful house perfect a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.319
 mansion with everything you want but 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.319
 what there is tension 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.800
 you can not see the other person who 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.810
 I was living with signs that's for 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.830
 me the harmony 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.520
 It can not be everything 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.520
 a tolerance level 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.040
 one with the life of the others 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.620
 but I started my artistic career as 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.430
 model 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.819
 the teenager 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.380
 and that allowed me to travel to europe I was 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.640
 in Turkey studying 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.640
 I enjoyed it pretty formal 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.250
 from there I went to the angels to study 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.120
 the acting 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.120
 45 years as why 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.760
 at the end of the studies you can have a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.930
 small participation in a 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.699
 good can you be called 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.750
 and from there I came to Venezuela from 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.130
 holidays 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.130
 on vacation though 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.479
 that's how I started my first 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.840
 telenovela that was the one-eyed cat and 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.840
 as well 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.389
 at this stage return to usa 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.360
 the festival is war of posters that 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.550
 He is currently on TV 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.590
 cable 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.600
 unofficially it was for meats 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.810
 several sites like festivals like 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.810

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.610
 new York 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.950
 pretty good in 60 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.760
 now in venezuela- I find myself 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.320
 developing three bills 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.320
 two are independent 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.999
 but we are already 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.729
 midyear 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.710
 the transition process towards 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.810
 first I'm going to make vegetarian time 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.810
 because it wins me is quite difficult 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.600
 eating a little bit of cheese a little bit 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.870
 of eggs 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.430
 seafood from time to time until 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.430
 can already make the transition 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.419
 It's meat 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.260
 body all that remains 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
