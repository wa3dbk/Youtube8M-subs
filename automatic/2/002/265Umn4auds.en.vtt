Shinnecock bags which is on the south

Shinnecock bags which is on the south
side<00:00:34.090> of<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.450> locks<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.870> obviously<00:00:35.290> the

side of the locks and obviously the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.470 
side of the locks and obviously the
great<00:00:35.559> Peconic<00:00:35.950> bays<00:00:36.130> on<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.400> north<00:00:36.640> side<00:00:36.700> are

great Peconic bays on the north side are

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.900 
great Peconic bays on the north side are
going<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.750> be<00:00:37.840> at<00:00:37.930> similar<00:00:38.500> levels<00:00:39.160> when

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
going to be at similar levels when

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.030 
going to be at similar levels when
they're<00:00:40.090> at<00:00:40.270> or<00:00:40.570> near<00:00:40.809> similar<00:00:41.350> levels<00:00:41.770> that's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
they're at or near similar levels that's

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.830 
they're at or near similar levels that's
what<00:00:42.400> is<00:00:42.610> referred<00:00:42.910> to<00:00:42.970> as<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.330> locks<00:00:43.570> being

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
what is referred to as the locks being

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.920 
what is referred to as the locks being
open<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.460> if<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.610> hear<00:00:45.790> on<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.090> radio<00:00:46.239> for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
open so if you hear on the radio for

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.729 
open so if you hear on the radio for
argument's<00:00:47.350> sake

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
argument's sake

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.210 
argument's sake
the<00:00:47.920> locks<00:00:48.190> are<00:00:48.400> now<00:00:48.520> open<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.720> could<00:00:49.930> be

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
the locks are now open it could be

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.680 
the locks are now open it could be
confusing<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.580> some<00:00:51.850> people<00:00:51.879> because<00:00:52.540> it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
confusing to some people because it

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.689 
confusing to some people because it
almost<00:00:52.900> sounds<00:00:53.350> like<00:00:53.379> okay<00:00:53.710> now<00:00:54.280> they're<00:00:54.460> open

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
almost sounds like okay now they're open

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.189 
almost sounds like okay now they're open
I<00:00:54.790> can<00:00:54.820> go<00:00:55.059> through<00:00:55.330> but<00:00:55.629> when<00:00:55.870> they're<00:00:55.989> closed

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
I can go through but when they're closed

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.450 
I can go through but when they're closed
I<00:00:56.440> can't<00:00:56.650> go<00:00:56.800> through<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.910> reality<00:00:58.840> it's<00:00:59.460> more

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
I can't go through in reality it's more

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.549 
I can't go through in reality it's more
predictably<00:01:01.239> safe<00:01:01.690> when<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.140> locks<00:01:02.350> are

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
predictably safe when the locks are

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.160 
predictably safe when the locks are
closed<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.969> when<00:01:04.119> they<00:01:04.239> say<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.600> locks<00:01:04.839> are

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
closed so when they say the locks are

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.770 
closed so when they say the locks are
closed<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:05.979> simply<00:01:06.460> means<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.360> lochness

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
closed it simply means that the lochness

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.080 
closed it simply means that the lochness
was<00:01:08.050> made<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.410> determination<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:09.340> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
was made to determination that the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.550 
was made to determination that the
levels<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.690> water<00:01:10.930> have<00:01:11.200> gotten

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
levels of the water have gotten

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.800 
levels of the water have gotten
disparate<00:01:12.220> enough<00:01:12.460> where<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> current<00:01:13.690> is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
disparate enough where the current is

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.310 
disparate enough where the current is
starting<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.649> go<00:01:15.330> more<00:01:16.330> aggressively<00:01:17.110> than

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
starting to go more aggressively than

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.830 
starting to go more aggressively than
what<00:01:17.619> he<00:01:18.369> or<00:01:18.520> she<00:01:18.550> thinks<00:01:18.910> is<00:01:19.149> comfortable<00:01:19.630> for

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
what he or she thinks is comfortable for

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.480 
what he or she thinks is comfortable for
vote<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.140> pass<00:01:20.350> through<00:01:20.619> that's<00:01:21.160> when<00:01:21.399> they

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
vote to pass through that's when they

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.870 
vote to pass through that's when they
make<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.670> decision<00:01:21.789> to<00:01:22.390> close<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.289> locks<00:01:23.880> but

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
make a decision to close the locks but

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.940 
make a decision to close the locks but
I've<00:01:25.119> had<00:01:25.330> many<00:01:25.930> many<00:01:26.170> clients<00:01:26.410> say<00:01:26.649> oh<00:01:26.680> well

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
I've had many many clients say oh well

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.859 
I've had many many clients say oh well
watching<00:01:27.340> closing<00:01:27.640> people<00:01:27.820> through<00:01:28.149> it's

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
watching closing people through it's

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.930 
watching closing people through it's
actually<00:01:29.229> exactly<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> opposite<00:01:30.640> because

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
actually exactly the opposite because

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.359 
actually exactly the opposite because
when<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.210> locks<00:01:31.450> are<00:01:31.659> closed<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.130> very

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
when the locks are closed it's a very

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.550 
when the locks are closed it's a very
controlled<00:01:33.909> environment<00:01:34.060> how<00:01:34.990> severe<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.530> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
controlled environment how severe is the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.320 
controlled environment how severe is the
time<00:01:35.860> coming<00:01:36.189> through<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.580> it's<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:37.030> its

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
time coming through and it's at its

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.359 
time coming through and it's at its
worst<00:01:37.960> water<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.799> kind<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.070> think<00:01:39.310> about

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
worst water and just kind of think about

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.710 
worst water and just kind of think about
it<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.700> your<00:01:39.820> bathtub<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.450> know<00:01:40.510> when<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
it in your bathtub you know when you

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.179 
it in your bathtub you know when you
pull<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:40.990> drain<00:01:41.200> on<00:01:41.380> your<00:01:41.530> bathtub<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:42.040> have

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
pull the drain on your bathtub you have

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.130 
pull the drain on your bathtub you have
a<00:01:42.220> lot<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.670> water<00:01:43.000> going<00:01:43.330> through<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.960> little

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
a lot of water going through a little

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.429 
a lot of water going through a little
drain<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:45.280> creates<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:46.060> circular<00:01:46.630> pattern<00:01:47.080> as

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
drain it creates a circular pattern as

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.399 
drain it creates a circular pattern as
it<00:01:47.590> drains<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.430> locks<00:01:49.119> do<00:01:49.600> exactly<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.350> same

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
it drains the locks do exactly the same

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.710 
it drains the locks do exactly the same
thing<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.979> have<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.189> lot<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.610> water<00:01:52.000> dancing

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
thing you have a lot of water dancing

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.410 
thing you have a lot of water dancing
through<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.020> narrow<00:01:53.439> area<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.729> when<00:01:54.970> it's<00:01:55.150> just

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
through a narrow area so when it's just

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.810 
through a narrow area so when it's just
slightly<00:01:55.810> disparate<00:01:56.590> you'll<00:01:57.040> just<00:01:57.220> see<00:01:57.400> very

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
slightly disparate you'll just see very

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.530 
slightly disparate you'll just see very
very<00:01:58.479> mild<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.740> know<00:01:59.890> turns<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.090> water<00:02:01.299> as

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
very mild you know turns in the water as

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.020 
very mild you know turns in the water as
it<00:02:02.049> becomes<00:02:02.350> more<00:02:02.470> despairing<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.490> turn

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
it becomes more despairing that turn

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.679 
it becomes more despairing that turn
will<00:02:04.270> become<00:02:04.600> more<00:02:05.079> aggressive<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.390> then

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
will become more aggressive so and then

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.090 
will become more aggressive so and then
it'll<00:02:07.869> get<00:02:08.079> to<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> point<00:02:08.440> where<00:02:08.679> again<00:02:08.890> with

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it'll get to a point where again with

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.039 
it'll get to a point where again with
luck<00:02:09.280> mr.<00:02:09.640> says<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:10.269> is<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.899> know

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
luck mr. says all right this is you know

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.080 
luck mr. says all right this is you know
getting<00:02:11.530> too<00:02:12.190> aggressive<00:02:12.760> or<00:02:12.880> he'll

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
getting too aggressive or he'll

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
getting too aggressive or he'll
hopefully<00:02:13.630> just<00:02:13.840> before<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.320> point

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
hopefully just before that point

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.610 
hopefully just before that point
let's<00:02:15.220> close<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.459> lot<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.959> one<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.380> few

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
let's close a lot is it's one of the few

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.600 
let's close a lot is it's one of the few
times

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
times

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.870 
times
going<00:02:19.420> through<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> locks<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.160> don't

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
going through the locks that you don't

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.610 
going through the locks that you don't
want<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.329> worry<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.870> 5<00:02:23.200> mile<00:02:23.410> an<00:02:23.560> hour

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
want to worry about a 5 mile an hour

because<00:02:30.549> again<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.450> little<00:02:31.690> bit<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.900> a

because again if it's a little bit of a

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.259 
because again if it's a little bit of a
whirlpool<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.880> imagine<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> give<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
whirlpool you imagine if you give a

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.460 
whirlpool you imagine if you give a
little<00:02:34.420> bit<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.660> throttle<00:02:34.840> I'm<00:02:35.079> not<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.410> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
little bit of throttle I'm not going to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.990 
little bit of throttle I'm not going to
go<00:02:35.560> wide<00:02:35.770> open<00:02:36.069> or<00:02:36.129> something<00:02:36.459> but<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.640> a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
go wide open or something but just a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.550 
go wide open or something but just a
little

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
little

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.820 
little
more<00:02:38.040> than<00:02:38.550> what<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.970> normally<00:02:39.300> would<00:02:40.140> so

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
more than what you normally would so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.130 
more than what you normally would so
you're<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:41.160> powering<00:02:41.940> through<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
you're now powering through that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
you're now powering through that
whirlpool<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.610> poster<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.240> you're<00:02:45.360> going

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
whirlpool as a poster if you're going

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.430 
whirlpool as a poster if you're going
too<00:02:45.810> slow

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
too slow

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.610 
too slow
your<00:02:46.860> boat<00:02:47.069> will<00:02:47.220> become<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:48.569> an<00:02:48.930> effect<00:02:49.350> of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
your boat will become at an effect of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.320 
your boat will become at an effect of
the<00:02:49.830> whirlpool<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.240> of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the whirlpool and you can get kind of

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
the whirlpool and you can get kind of
tore<00:02:51.510> sideways<00:02:51.959> fairly<00:02:52.440> fairly<00:02:53.100> easily

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
tore sideways fairly fairly easily

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.160 
tore sideways fairly fairly easily
the<00:02:53.640> reasons<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.030> keeping<00:02:54.360> away<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:54.989> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the reasons are keeping away is so that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.320 
the reasons are keeping away is so that
if<00:02:55.319> I<00:02:55.440> decide<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> need<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.520> power<00:02:56.730> through<00:02:57.150> I've

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
if I decide I need to power through I've

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.210 
if I decide I need to power through I've
got<00:02:57.540> plenty<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.959> space<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:58.860> not<00:02:59.069> gonna

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
got plenty of space that I'm not gonna

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
got plenty of space that I'm not gonna
run<00:02:59.459> up<00:02:59.580> on<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> stern<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.390> both<00:03:01.050> because

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
run up on the stern of that both because

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620 
run up on the stern of that both because
I've<00:03:02.280> seen<00:03:02.489> again<00:03:02.790> many<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.150> times<00:03:03.450> where

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
I've seen again many a times where

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.960 
I've seen again many a times where
people<00:03:03.660> feel<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.590> need<00:03:04.620> okay<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.430> need<00:03:05.819> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
people feel the need okay I do need to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.390 
people feel the need okay I do need to
go<00:03:06.090> faster<00:03:06.660> when<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.530> an<00:03:07.650> allowance<00:03:08.190> or

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
go faster when they have an allowance or

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
go faster when they have an allowance or
some<00:03:08.580> space<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.239> go<00:03:09.300> faster<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:10.320> have<00:03:10.440> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
some space to go faster they have to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
some space to go faster they have to
back<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.340> throttle<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.970> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.239> back

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
back up the throttle and when you back

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.759 
back up the throttle and when you back
off<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> throttle<00:03:12.780> that's<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> absolute

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
off the throttle that's the absolute

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.800 
off the throttle that's the absolute
worst<00:03:14.010> thing<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:15.510> you're<00:03:15.780> not

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
worst thing to do because now you're not

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.570 
worst thing to do because now you're not
driving<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> boat<00:03:16.709> through<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.070> water<00:03:17.190> the
