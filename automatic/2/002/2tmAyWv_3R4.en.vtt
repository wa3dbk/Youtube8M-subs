will<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> point<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:41.070> sore<00:02:42.070> point

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
will be the point of that sore point

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.120 
will be the point of that sore point
i'll<00:02:45.280> go<00:02:45.520> for<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.790> look<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.900> i<00:02:47.590> might<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.100> a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
i'll go for it look so i might have a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.580 
i'll go for it look so i might have a
point<00:02:48.750> actually<00:02:49.750> if<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.020> chase<00:02:50.230> about<00:02:50.440> this

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
point actually if I can chase about this

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.090 
point actually if I can chase about this
noise<00:02:51.840> maybe<00:02:52.840> use<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.170> default<00:02:53.920> giclee<00:02:56.100> in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
noise maybe use the default giclee in

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.700 
noise maybe use the default giclee in
fact<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.670> e5<00:02:58.210> squares<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.900> e4<00:02:59.380> square<00:02:59.500> is
