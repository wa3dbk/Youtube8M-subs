it's<00:00:07.350> time<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.770> hydrate<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.280> used<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.760> so

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
it's time to hydrate are used and so

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.850 
it's time to hydrate are used and so
what<00:00:09.599> I've<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:09.929> here<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.260> bowl<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.530> I've

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
what I've got here is a bowl that I've

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.919 
what I've got here is a bowl that I've
sanitized<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.700> then<00:00:12.210> poured<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.660> bit

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
sanitized and then poured a little bit

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.200 
sanitized and then poured a little bit
about<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> half<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> cup<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.799> distilled<00:00:14.549> water<00:00:14.849> in

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
about a half a cup of distilled water in

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.420 
about a half a cup of distilled water in
there<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.900> sprinkle<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
there and I'm just going to sprinkle the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.210 
there and I'm just going to sprinkle the
yeast<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.029> top<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.080> water<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:22.220> again

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
yeast on top of the water and again

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.560 
yeast on top of the water and again
there's<00:00:23.400> no<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:23.939> there's<00:00:24.210> no<00:00:24.269> need<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
there's no for this there's no need to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
there's no for this there's no need to
make<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> starter<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.800> gonna<00:00:25.890> we're

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
make a starter we're just gonna we're

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.650 
make a starter we're just gonna we're
just<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> hydrate<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.269> yeast<00:00:27.449> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
just going to hydrate this yeast it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
just going to hydrate this yeast it's
going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.050> good<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.650> hungry<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
going to get good at hungry when it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.890 
going to get good at hungry when it
wakes<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> make<00:00:30.869> sure

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
wakes up so we're going to make sure

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
wakes up so we're going to make sure
that<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.470> coral<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.980> whole<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.340> east<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that we just coral a whole thing east on

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.639 
that we just coral a whole thing east on
there<00:00:32.910> I'm<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> cover<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.750> now<00:00:33.899> but

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
there I'm just going to cover it now but

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.290 
there I'm just going to cover it now but
with<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> plate<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> I've<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:35.730> sanitized

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
with a plate that I've also sanitized

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
with a plate that I've also sanitized
and<00:00:36.840> we're<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> sit<00:00:37.770> for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and we're just going with that sit for

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.090 
and we're just going with that sit for
about<00:00:38.100> five<00:00:38.969> minutes<00:00:39.270> until<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.770> long<00:00:40.950> as

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
about five minutes until or as long as

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
about five minutes until or as long as
it<00:00:41.219> takes<00:00:41.370> while<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.760> brewing<00:00:41.940> okay<00:00:42.870> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
it takes while we're brewing okay so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
it takes while we're brewing okay so
you're<00:00:43.079> taking<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> heat<00:00:43.950> we've

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you're taking this out the heat we've

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
you're taking this out the heat we've
let<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> cool<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> half<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.899> hour

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
let it cool down about a half an hour

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.220 
let it cool down about a half an hour
and<00:00:46.579> just<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.879> beer<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.450> wine<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.809> any

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and just like with beer or wine or any

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.479 
and just like with beer or wine or any
other<00:00:49.379> alcohol<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.920> real<00:00:50.070> important<00:00:50.399> when

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
other alcohol it's real important when

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
other alcohol it's real important when
we<00:00:50.579> pitch<00:00:50.789> our<00:00:50.969> yeast<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
we pitch our yeast that we get to a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.799 
we pitch our yeast that we get to a
proper<00:00:52.890> temperature<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
proper temperature and which is going to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.590 
proper temperature and which is going to
about<00:00:54.989> 68<00:00:55.350> degrees<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.640> real<00:00:56.789> secret<00:00:57.030> list<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
about 68 degrees the real secret list is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
about 68 degrees the real secret list is
that<00:00:57.629> we've<00:00:57.899> kept<00:00:58.260> our<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.649> download<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that we've kept our for download that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.349 
that we've kept our for download that
was<00:00:59.340> used<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> refrigerator<00:01:00.270> overnight

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
was used in the refrigerator overnight

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.569 
was used in the refrigerator overnight
so<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> they're<00:01:01.590> below<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.190> 40<00:01:02.550> degrees

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so that they're below like 40 degrees

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
so that they're below like 40 degrees
and<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.719> idea<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.530> had<00:01:04.650> four

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and the idea is that if we had four

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
and the idea is that if we had four
downs<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.640> 40<00:01:05.939> degree<00:01:06.439> apple<00:01:07.439> juice<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.010> our<00:01:08.900> 150

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
downs a 40 degree apple juice to our 150

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
downs a 40 degree apple juice to our 150
degree<00:01:10.200> apple<00:01:10.590> slurry<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.220> should<00:01:12.000> even<00:01:12.150> out

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
degree apple slurry it should even out

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.100 
degree apple slurry it should even out
to<00:01:12.659> about<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.710> 68<00:01:14.220> 70<00:01:14.580> degrees<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> we're

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to about you know 68 70 degrees so we're

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
to about you know 68 70 degrees so we're
going<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.380> ahead<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.390> okay

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
going to go ahead and do that now okay

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.580 
going to go ahead and do that now okay
so<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.750> we're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.110> first<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.470> we're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so what we're going to do first is we're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
so what we're going to do first is we're
going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> add<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.610> gallons<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
going to add these these two gallons of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
going to add these these two gallons of
apple<00:01:21.210> juice<00:01:21.360> first<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:23.100> we're<00:01:23.220> going

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
apple juice first and then we're going

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
apple juice first and then we're going
to<00:01:23.369> add<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> hot<00:01:23.880> apple<00:01:24.540> slurry<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.380> idea

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to add the hot apple slurry in the idea

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
to add the hot apple slurry in the idea
is<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.700> hot<00:01:27.000> apple<00:01:27.270> or

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
is that if we have the hot apple or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
is that if we have the hot apple or
slurry<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> first<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> cold<00:01:28.979> above

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
slurry and first and then the cold above

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280 
slurry and first and then the cold above
it<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.820> run<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> risk<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.540> shattering<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it we run the risk of shattering the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
it we run the risk of shattering the
glass<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.880> important<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> note<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
glass and it's important to note that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
glass and it's important to note that
because<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> refrigerator<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because it's in the refrigerator the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
because it's in the refrigerator the
refrigerator<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:37.049> bacterial<00:01:37.979> late

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
refrigerator is a really bacterial late

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
refrigerator is a really bacterial late
in<00:01:38.250> place<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.240> sprayed<00:01:39.659> down

you're<00:03:56.099> a<00:03:56.129> couple<00:03:56.489> other<00:03:56.609> options<00:03:57.090> one<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:57.959> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
you're a couple other options one is you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.710 
you're a couple other options one is you
can<00:03:58.769> sweeten<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.310> with<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.519> sugar<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:01.040> mouthal

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
can sweeten it with a sugar like mouthal

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.680 
can sweeten it with a sugar like mouthal
splenda<00:04:04.879> nutrasweet<00:04:05.879> these<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.269> sugars<00:04:06.540> that

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
splenda nutrasweet these are sugars that

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.710 
splenda nutrasweet these are sugars that
don't<00:04:06.900> ferment<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.919> by<00:04:08.430> putting<00:04:08.760> those<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.449> and

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
don't ferment so by putting those in and

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.629 
don't ferment so by putting those in and
then<00:04:09.959> putting<00:04:10.290> some<00:04:10.500> framing<00:04:10.799> sugar<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.400> the

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
then putting some framing sugar in the

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.860 
then putting some framing sugar in the
priming<00:04:11.970> sugar<00:04:12.000> will<00:04:12.359> ferment<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.750> way

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
priming sugar will ferment all the way

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.229 
priming sugar will ferment all the way
out<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.440> other<00:04:13.560> sugars<00:04:14.010> won't<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.120> will

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
out the other sugars won't so that will

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.580 
out the other sugars won't so that will
give<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.569> slightly<00:04:15.810> sweeter<00:04:16.169> taste<00:04:16.440> I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
give you a slightly sweeter taste I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.779 
give you a slightly sweeter taste I
personally<00:04:16.889> don't<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.400> chemical

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
personally don't like the chemical

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.199 
personally don't like the chemical
sugars<00:04:18.769> but<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.859> can<00:04:20.010> do<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.940> if

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
sugars but you can do that now if you if

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.969 
sugars but you can do that now if you if
you<00:04:21.359> don't<00:04:21.599> want<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.840> do<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:21.959> then<00:04:22.560> there<00:04:22.830> is

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
you don't want to do that then there is

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.830 
you don't want to do that then there is
one<00:04:23.220> other<00:04:23.250> option<00:04:23.490> available<00:04:23.909> which<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.690> you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
one other option available which is you

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.659 
one other option available which is you
can<00:04:25.050> bottle<00:04:25.949> this<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.770> with<00:04:29.159> a<00:04:29.370> little

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
can bottle this with the with a little

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.390 
can bottle this with the with a little
more<00:04:29.970> sugar<00:04:30.180> than<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:30.630> want<00:04:30.979> let<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.099> ferment

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
more sugar than you want let it ferment

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.339 
more sugar than you want let it ferment
for<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.729> few<00:04:32.909> days<00:04:33.060> until<00:04:33.449> it<00:04:33.960> reaches<00:04:34.320> the

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
for a few days until it reaches the

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.350 
for a few days until it reaches the
desired<00:04:34.620> amount<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:35.039> carbonation<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.849> then

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
desired amount of carbonation and then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.110 
desired amount of carbonation and then
you<00:04:36.479> can<00:04:36.659> boil<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.199> bottles<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:38.250> went<00:04:38.669> now<00:04:38.820> not

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
you can boil the bottles I went now not

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.580 
you can boil the bottles I went now not
boiled<00:04:39.539> them<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.900> heat<00:04:40.050> them<00:04:40.169> up<00:04:40.289> enough

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
boiled them but you heat them up enough

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.740 
boiled them but you heat them up enough
to<00:04:40.680> kill<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.099> e<00:04:41.130> stuff<00:04:41.550> if<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.300> do<00:04:42.449> this<00:04:42.599> you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
to kill the e stuff if you do this you

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.290 
to kill the e stuff if you do this you
gotta<00:04:42.930> really<00:04:43.169> careful<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.889> one<00:04:44.300> you're

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
gotta really careful that one you're

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.439 
gotta really careful that one you're
protected<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.810> case<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.080> balls<00:04:46.260> explode<00:04:47.449> so

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
protected in case the balls explode so

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.450 
protected in case the balls explode so
that<00:04:48.599> means<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.139> know<00:04:49.199> keeping<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.070> lid<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.280> it

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
that means you know keeping a lid on it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.790 
that means you know keeping a lid on it
you<00:04:51.090> also<00:04:51.300> want<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.720> be<00:04:51.810> really<00:04:52.080> careful<00:04:52.260> that

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
you also want to be really careful that

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.980 
you also want to be really careful that
you<00:04:52.949> don't<00:04:53.220> heat<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.909> water<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:54.270> too<00:04:54.599> quickly

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
you don't heat the water up too quickly

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.460 
you don't heat the water up too quickly
I<00:04:55.860> wouldn't<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:57.030> would<00:04:57.870> put<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.110> water<00:04:58.260> in

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
I wouldn't go I would put the water in

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.779 
I wouldn't go I would put the water in
at<00:04:58.560> room<00:04:58.710> temperature<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.159> then<00:04:59.460> slowly

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
at room temperature and then slowly

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.040 
at room temperature and then slowly
bring<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:00.449> to

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
bring it up to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.960 
bring it up to
150<00:05:03.050> 260<00:05:03.889> degrees<00:05:03.980> that's<00:05:04.430> sufficient<00:05:04.880> to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
150 260 degrees that's sufficient to

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.550 
150 260 degrees that's sufficient to
kill<00:05:05.150> off<00:05:05.300> these<00:05:05.510> at<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:06.230> point<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.470> would

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
kill off these at that point I would

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.080 
kill off these at that point I would
turn<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.830> heat<00:05:06.980> off<00:05:07.070> but<00:05:07.639> then<00:05:07.790> return<00:05:08.060> back

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
turn the heat off but then return back

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.870 
turn the heat off but then return back
to<00:05:08.360> room<00:05:08.720> temperature<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.580> at<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.699> point

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
to room temperature and at that point

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.240 
to room temperature and at that point
you<00:05:11.000> should<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.300> good<00:05:11.740> well<00:05:12.740> so<00:05:12.889> that's<00:05:12.979> pretty

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
you should be good well so that's pretty

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
you should be good well so that's pretty
much<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.750> what<00:05:14.750> I'm<00:05:14.840> going<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:14.990> do<00:05:15.080> now<00:05:15.229> I've

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
much it what I'm going to do now I've

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.810 
much it what I'm going to do now I've
got<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.530> quark<00:05:15.889> in<00:05:16.010> this<00:05:16.190> I'm<00:05:16.520> going<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.760> go

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
got a quark in this I'm going to go

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.570 
got a quark in this I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:16.970> take<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.389> cool<00:05:17.660> dark<00:05:17.930> place

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
ahead and take it to a cool dark place

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.969 
ahead and take it to a cool dark place
between<00:05:19.580> 68<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.570> 80<00:05:21.020> degrees<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.650> probably

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
between 68 and 80 degrees is probably

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.450 
between 68 and 80 degrees is probably
fine<00:05:22.250> for<00:05:22.669> this<00:05:22.760> let<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.240> ferment<00:05:23.510> out<00:05:23.750> between

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
fine for this let it ferment out between

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.780 
fine for this let it ferment out between
7-10<00:05:25.460> days<00:05:25.750> in<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:27.229> next<00:05:27.500> 24<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:27.979> 48<00:05:28.250> hours<00:05:28.400> is

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
7-10 days in the next 24 to 48 hours is

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.010 
7-10 days in the next 24 to 48 hours is
going<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.090> start<00:05:29.300> bubbling<00:05:29.600> through<00:05:29.900> the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
going to start bubbling through the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.129 
going to start bubbling through the
airlock<00:05:30.169> pretty<00:05:31.100> quickly<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.510> probably<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
airlock pretty quickly and probably a

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.750 
airlock pretty quickly and probably a
bubble<00:05:33.380> every<00:05:33.470> second<00:05:33.950> when<00:05:34.070> that<00:05:34.190> slows<00:05:34.490> down

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
bubble every second when that slows down

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.930 
bubble every second when that slows down
to<00:05:35.180> about<00:05:35.360> one<00:05:35.660> bubble<00:05:36.020> every<00:05:36.080> minute<00:05:36.500> or<00:05:36.620> less

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
to about one bubble every minute or less

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.100 
to about one bubble every minute or less
at<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.120> point<00:05:38.330> i<00:05:38.389> usually<00:05:38.690> give<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:38.960> couple

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
at that point i usually give it a couple

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.659 
at that point i usually give it a couple
extra<00:05:39.290> days<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.950> to<00:05:40.010> make<00:05:40.190> sure<00:05:40.220> that<00:05:40.520> it's

it<00:05:47.650> don't<00:05:48.650> worry<00:05:48.919> as<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.610> can<00:05:49.729> see<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.030> yeast

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
it don't worry as you can see the yeast

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.790 
it don't worry as you can see the yeast
is<00:05:50.389> kind<00:05:50.570> of<00:05:50.630> settled<00:05:50.960> on<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.169> top<00:05:51.380> here<00:05:51.650> I

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
is kind of settled on the top here I

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.920 
is kind of settled on the top here I
wouldn't<00:05:52.669> worry<00:05:52.850> too<00:05:52.940> much<00:05:53.090> about<00:05:53.210> stirring

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
wouldn't worry too much about stirring

wouldn't worry too much about stirring
it<00:05:54.139> in<00:05:54.289> its<00:05:55.280> gonna<00:05:55.580> as<00:05:55.880> naive<00:05:56.210> as<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.750> yeast

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
it in its gonna as naive as that yeast

it in its gonna as naive as that yeast
multiplies<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:57.830> grows<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:59.060> will<00:05:59.210> get<00:05:59.360> to

multiplies and grows it will get to

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.960 
multiplies and grows it will get to
every<00:05:59.690> part<00:05:59.930> of<00:05:59.960> this<00:06:00.110> and<00:06:00.350> actually<00:06:01.070> by<00:06:01.910> the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
every part of this and actually by the

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.430 
every part of this and actually by the
process<00:06:02.419> of<00:06:02.479> you<00:06:02.630> carried<00:06:02.960> it<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.199> dark

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
process of you carried it to the dark

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.810 
process of you carried it to the dark
place<00:06:03.620> you'll<00:06:03.860> probably<00:06:04.070> have<00:06:04.280> shaken<00:06:04.669> up

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
place you'll probably have shaken up

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.690 
place you'll probably have shaken up
plenty<00:06:05.300> anyway<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.710> that's<00:06:07.190> pretty<00:06:07.520> much<00:06:07.639> it

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
plenty anyway so that's pretty much it

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.640 
plenty anyway so that's pretty much it
we've<00:06:08.060> made<00:06:08.330> ourselves<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.930> nice<00:06:09.080> apple<00:06:09.440> cider

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
we've made ourselves a nice apple cider

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.469 
we've made ourselves a nice apple cider
I<00:06:09.770> hope<00:06:10.010> you<00:06:10.190> have<00:06:10.610> enjoyed<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.300> I<00:06:11.450> hope
