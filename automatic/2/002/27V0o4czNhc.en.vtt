so<00:01:32.390> in<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.630> beginning<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:33.170> think<00:01:33.260> things<00:01:33.710> were

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
so in the beginning I think things were

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.120 
so in the beginning I think things were
pretty<00:01:34.520> good<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.180> as<00:01:35.780> time<00:01:36.380> went<00:01:36.560> on<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
pretty good but as time went on the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.550 
pretty good but as time went on the
institutions<00:01:37.880> started<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.360> get<00:01:38.510> very

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
institutions started to get very

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.170 
institutions started to get very
overcrowded<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> when<00:01:40.400> things<00:01:40.850> get

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
overcrowded and when things get

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.060 
overcrowded and when things get
overcrowded<00:01:41.630> nothing<00:01:42.200> good<00:01:42.410> comes<00:01:42.680> from<00:01:42.770> it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
overcrowded nothing good comes from it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.850 
overcrowded nothing good comes from it
and<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.180> more<00:01:44.360> people<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:44.869> means<00:01:45.650> you
