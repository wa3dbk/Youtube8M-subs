you<00:03:45.450> were<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.690> go<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:45.990> this<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:47.100> didn't<00:03:47.400> get

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
you were to go like this you didn't get

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.400 
you were to go like this you didn't get
deep<00:03:47.880> enough<00:03:48.210> and<00:03:48.420> then<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.600> grind<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.170> well

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
deep enough and then you grind your well

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.870 
deep enough and then you grind your well
down<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.820> that

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
down you just really don't have that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.660 
down you just really don't have that
much<00:03:51.090> penetration<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.560> what<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.220> do<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.520> we

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
much penetration so what we do is we

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.510 
much penetration so what we do is we
grind<00:03:54.060> our<00:03:54.270> edges<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.870> both<00:03:55.110> sides<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.800> then

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
grind our edges on both sides and then

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.880 
grind our edges on both sides and then
when<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:56.970> weld<00:03:57.210> you've<00:03:57.810> got<00:03:58.050> plenty<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.530> weld

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890
