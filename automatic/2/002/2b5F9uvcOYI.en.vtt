00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.280
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.590
 product videos today is about that 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.019
 theme how do I fix a rat 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.430
 swinging shock absorbers on an ax 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.500
 For that there are different possibilities 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.990
 I have an axis here once 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.570
 company al ko kober on the table is the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.310
 so far already prepared for the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.260
 recording of statements damper 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 Here we have such a plastic 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.900
 then the stuff will be removed 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.239
 this holder just latches the plugged 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.820
 I'll show you later in this part 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.070
 videos if they have no alcoa or 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.809
 an alcoa-share older year of construction where 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.659
 this preparation and not available 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.190
 then you need such an 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.799
 sweat lax for later 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.780
 welding to the ax will swing 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.269
 then welded in about that way 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.940
 but we will continue with this now 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.549
 Axis and I show how these plug 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 Rag fastened to remove it 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.519
 First of all, this black plastic 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.589
 stuff the update plug lift it 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.600
 simply with a screwdriver out 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.759
 and they already have the rectangular one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 Opening for the later insertion lobes 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.829
 uncovered, we come now already to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.869
 assemble the two places half nalco 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.780
 sell this advice shock absorber holder 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.369
 always as a set consisting of two parts 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.039
 these two opposite 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.000
 The halves of the ring can be broken by the 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.570
 Numbers printed on 58 25 09 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.159
 and 58 25 10 do not be fooled that it 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630
 not the order number you get 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.609
 these places do not help individually 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.369
 but only as a set and the 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.140
 order number for the set the dazzle me 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.670
 below in the comments to this with a 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.530
 as we can see we have such here 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.070
 vaulting therefore come right here 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.429
 purely 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.950
 the assembly is completely tool-free 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.840
 and without sweat possible pay attention 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.369
 just plug in on this case 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.380
 the front shows the direction of travel in 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.109
 Driving direction forward 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 whether you like the kick easy holder like that 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.520
 around or around must use that 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.439
 shows this celebration of 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.359
 in front of who in our direction 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.520
 this direction and now we can 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.280
 These places just help 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.640
 turn in this rectangle slot the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.140
 axis and fasten in the next step 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 would go to the rat shock absorber 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.130
 all we have to do now is 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900
 to attach the rat shock absorber 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.180
 To do this, we put the rat shotgun 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.980
 on the bottom with the advice 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.270
 Shock absorber bottom through the two 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.069
 bottles put through the mother 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.750
 accept tool by hand screwing 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.330
 that goes well with this gap 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 away and the two half-shells claw 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.780
 then right in the downturns 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.239
 so they do not have anything anymore 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.880
 can slip or slip and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.030
 already she is mounting the paddle steamer 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.950
 completed 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 If you like, please look 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:55.370
 also our other product videos until 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.290
 Everything we do now 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.250
 only the rat shock absorber is needed 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.170
 to assemble 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.580
 we put the screw through 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.580
 let both half-shells through half 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.580
 mount
