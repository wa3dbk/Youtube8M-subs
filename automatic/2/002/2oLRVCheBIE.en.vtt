00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.199
 make the video quietly at home 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:32.279
 that's it then it's gone and small 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 guess what is it all so 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 little tiny little everything 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 it's the little tiny timer 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.110
 small little short we therefore cares 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 if you guessed these are 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.969
 shoes toss shoes off 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.289
 so here are some of the brand 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 honeye tech fighter boot 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.600
 generation to generation while version 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.060
 kaki here is then we will bring his 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 shoe so rising a few 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 characteristics 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.520
 so excuse me we're going to crop 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.250
 a small zoom you 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.619
 So much for those who do not make 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 settle or who are at kaka level like 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:35.289
 I will try to understand together 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.450
 so that a good question 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:44.020
 yeah yeah bah caused the ham and yes 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.369
 but it's the cow ah yes caused the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.239
 cow good cows wish good leader 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.679
 maybe cow yes why not 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:56.849
 1200 denier polyester so that's the 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:02.280
 Shoe material is known 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:05.079
 polyester polyurethanes linings 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.569
 linings yes surely maybe good of 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:14.459
 polyester what slip drinking street bersol that 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 reminds me of zippers 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:25.239
 but that's not it since there are not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:27.459
 in fact paul you polyurethane in good soil 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.329
 but now you do not know the pilot 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.180
 short place it's not serious and pole and 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.600
 polyester laces are included 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 still 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:44.799
 So here is saiz 9 may it is the sizes 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 American but on the site so I'm going 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 specify immediately I bought them on 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.430
 asm it's for the sum of 54 euros without 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.410
 shipping 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.239
 so there are no customs fees or 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.430
 this or that since it is in germany 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:06.220
 is very very very happy with this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.980
 command and status are detailed in 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 France and so I try to size 9 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.959
 corresponds to 42 brief 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.920
 here is the model we are going 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:24.510
 open the box 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:29.099
 of course you see that the packaging and 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.349
 square we can say the shoe box 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.790
 so behind the cardboard we will do the 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.140
 quick turn here is the title shot 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.830
 it's the same on the other side 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.010
 So here is the package arrived in good 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.250
 just state it's me who can 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.060
 screw up without doing it on purpose I crushed it 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.700
 so sees his boots 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.440
 here they are and so I already have them 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.970
 setting so normally there is a paper 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.970
 who protects them 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.370
 and then there are those of the balls of 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.569
 paper inside to keep them 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:11.720
 in shape in a moment we will seem 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:15.390
 out to be closed was his 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.750
 Norma put them there since on the bed 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.260
 shoes is still room 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.860
 so this model is very very 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.570
 comfortable for the price super nothing to 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 say great product 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.760
 so here are the sizes just for 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.910
 information me that is normal in fact 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.340
 of the 41 I took them big battles 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.590
 above 42 to be able to put 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.250
 long time except that actually if I arrive 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.260
 here I'm not kidding I'm coming here 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.669
 short so its rather big size we're going 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.669
 say so after its very very flexible 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.180
 see my wings hold well the 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:08.130
 country the foot despite being small 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.340
 in but we are super comfortable if 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.669
 we are super comfort not good we are good 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.960
 in 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.080
 I missed something 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.350
 so here after the details are going their 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.020
 anti-slip soles taÃ§a you are 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.220
 in course that meant it was a trick 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.220
 to get here non-slip soles 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.130
 so after sending his monte anyway 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:37.900
 until now even half of the shins to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:41.259
 about a little less the laces are 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.470
 easy to get in very easy very 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:47.259
 easily in here's the sole can 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.020
 to change of course if you want 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.720
 change but hey it will be nothing the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.479
 wii inside yes week yes 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.259
 here 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:02.440
 and here is the impermeability 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:04.840
 normally no but by cons when we 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.820
 pour water on it cool it 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.729
 do not take it so that's a good point 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:16.240
 but I do not think it's 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:18.159
 waterproof for the price but otherwise I 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.370
 think that normally we should be at 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.750
 dry in there so no problem 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.060
 good I'll show you that the foot 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:32.530
 left is the same for the right foot 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:35.530
 here we are going to say on behalf of a small 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:40.570
 pair of rangers mostly call it 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.289
 bother or not really no sense 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:48.340
 I read again and she this color it 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.849
 also exists in black and so for 54 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.520
 euros 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.969
 go ahead go really good 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.880
 product 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:07:00.610
 it's my impressions very comfortable 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:05.199
 and listen I tell you very soon and 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.210
 leave like on the video it will make me very 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.979
 pleasure of the questions in the 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.949
 comments or the inbox 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.949
