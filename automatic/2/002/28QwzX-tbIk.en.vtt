 lavezzi alessandro manzoni one of the two tragedies of one of the greatest novelists 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.920

 at 20 di manzoni 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.600
 but surely it was the lesson 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.690
 of the rewriting of the writing scene and I think it was the most 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.060
 great master of scene writing 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.110
 that has managed to be faith and lele to the classic classics will want 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.640
 using the most futuristic microphone care technology was the first 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.240
 to use 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.950
 given ago I used modern means to really give 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.350
 Leonora the classics so much so that I believe one of the few Italian actors who beat the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.970
 in a very rigorous way it is perfect 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.880
 the actress is quoted some acts of the Manzoni tragedy accompanied by the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.770
 classical guitar by andrea de vitis high sunny some classics of the time 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.190
 hoped for perfect mixture of music and words 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.040
 compensation not the similar one in one's solitude in one's own 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.510
 intimacy absolutely I believe only and exclusively to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 I believe the ability of teachers to give 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.050
 indications on which texts to read if they are good enough to understand that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.220
 they often face it they are not it is only in the classic one can find it again 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 possibility of modern writing ie I believe that 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.649
 % being modern today is and terry and rereading the ancients 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.579

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.689

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.939
 the adamina of manzoni and with a reading shines and seas naples has come 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.760
 accompanied by the return from the execution of music of the time from 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:35.120
 paganini pupils earthy years the skill of ci andrea de vitis has seemed to do 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:39.739
