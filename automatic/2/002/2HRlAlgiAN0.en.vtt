00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
going here and the the top cabinet is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.450 
going here and the the top cabinet is
basically<00:00:29.820> his<00:00:30.470> it's<00:00:31.470> pretty<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.070> dry<00:00:32.579> sound

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.819 
basically his it's pretty the dry sound
and<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:36.300> most<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> effects<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.620> through

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and then most of the effects go through

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
and then most of the effects go through
the<00:00:37.920> bottom<00:00:38.219> cabinet<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.270> wet

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the bottom cabinet which is the wet

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.290 
the bottom cabinet which is the wet
cabinet<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.329> all<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.629> his<00:00:42.890> effects<00:00:44.270> seem<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
cabinet and all of his effects seem to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
cabinet and all of his effects seem to
be<00:00:45.450> routed<00:00:45.960> through<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.289> g-force<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> then

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
be routed through the g-force and then

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
be routed through the g-force and then
that's<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.510> eventual<00:00:49.379> final<00:00:49.800> output<00:00:50.190> into

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that's the eventual final output into

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
that's the eventual final output into
that<00:00:50.700> cabinet<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.760> once<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.910> kick<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.629> the

that cabinet so once I kick this in the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:06.630 
that cabinet so once I kick this in the
other<00:00:55.079> cabinet<00:00:55.620> turns<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:59.030> Distortion
