00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.310
 It was very difficult 2 are but they are not militants of our DNA 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.069
 and as if he does not see it anymore 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.069
 p 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.060
 the holographic technology 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
 became famous more than 20 years ago thanks to the cinema 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 and the movie be together where you see a hologram of Princess Leia 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 efe 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.569
 although there are 60 years the thin physique 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.569
 it was even the technique that we know as what I was doing 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 This technique allows us to generate images that seem suspended in the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.100
 air Colombians 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.170
 a hologram 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.470
 unlike in photography that product to the market garcÃ­a 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.840
 it can 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.180
 you can register the cnc in three dimensions 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.250
 pineapple 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 nigel fisher laboratory director of the faculty of architecture and design 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.730
 the 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.170
 if the photograph 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.120
 we look at her side we will see distorted 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.920
 interior does not achieve marcelo lombilla on the side 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 receives information from side of a face 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 if the front facing nose guide 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.340
 physically 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 the side of channel 10 that is 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.530
 in the image 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 to be a hologram a microscopic structure is laser engraved 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 on a light-sensitive film the three-dimensional image becomes visible 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.920
 when the structure is illuminated from the proper perspective the laboratory of 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.810
 holography 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.109
 says equipped with a bank 5 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.739
 which serves to capture holographic images behaviors is once arena 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.180
 what are we 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 in this area so that you do not look to close the program 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 the issue that there has to be even the slightest movement 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.559
 when the registration is made I took the slightest movement could cause 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.689
 that the draw was wrong 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.469
 what's really important about the movie is a movie photos tell 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:26.019
 that is the wall surface of traffic or video and that's where 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.849
 will register lima 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.310
 as the photographs a hologram capture rays of light 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.859
 but not any kind of facts 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.859
 in the id folder the start yes 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.029
 I do not think it's a fundamental element to get it from the CIA 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 because it has a touch the fierce we love timeless Juarense 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.429
 according to optics the light that is reflected in 1 percent as for example a 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.909
 face 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.889
 moves in the form of waves that can be graphed as they possess or 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.249
 Mathematics temporal coherence means that the laser emits 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.239
 uninterruptedly a corset and what can be considered equal to the previous 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.540
 having the data of the time it takes for the light to arrive from the object is possible 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.659
 differentiate its depth or relief therefore a wave that comes from the 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.219
 tip of the nose takes less to reach the photosensitive film than a wave 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 that bounces on one ear maybe further back 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.219
 what photography does capture the intensity of this wave that emits the 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.529
 object that you are photographed in capture rates by own goal height 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.229
 d this touch touch to go seeing 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.870
 a hologram let's go and capture the height of this wave 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.899
 Where peace is found in time 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:42.419
 it is true that you fancy 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.419
 split as three-dimensional 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.239
 the record is made in a shot that lasts a few seconds 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.519
 during which the town has to be completely turned off 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.149
 total for what they have to pay and in perfect stillness 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.399
 so that the holographic image is visible 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.399
 that is to say executions 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.359
 medium 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:13.060
 and we have to train the part of the development 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.810
 it's something very similar to the old red fourth photography the only 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.219
 difference is that we can not use red room 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.610
 because the afternoon eliane carob tree just what we want to avoid is 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.369
 look like red there will be work a quarter barber to reveal 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:33.659
 habitually holograms are used as security elements and in all 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.630
 the credit cards and in many drugs appearance holograms 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.630
 because they are very difficult to falsify or copy 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.409
 each program although environment will persist 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.309
 one sees it to equal identical love 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.969
 It is very difficult 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.879
 it is very difficult to create the conditions 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:56.519
 create special conditions to register each work 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.620
 so 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.620
 this impossible 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.089
 to be a 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:04.569
 laboratory 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.189
 for peak hours 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.200
 to reproduce the holograms of any 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200
 the event that is due to the art use in the dakar 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.560
 In the not too distant future it is possible that the application of holography 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.039
 telecommunications to reality situations like the one we are that 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.949
 until today they seem pure science fiction
