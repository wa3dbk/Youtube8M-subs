00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.649
 fabiana and we talk about it 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 here are your questions 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:27.060
 twitter is the first head down one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.090
 duration story down so it's not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.090
 possible 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 andreas and julie or if it is not a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.469
 seat there , games with consoles are 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 ruining paper role-playing games is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.960
 the desire to be together and not 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 playing on a TV no no you can do 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 one to the other also because we include 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 in these paper role-playing games that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 many do not know what games are from 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.339
 table that I am of the typical game you play 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 with a group of friends and so on 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.230
 excluding bingo, that is evil 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 not even a little 21 points like them 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.729
 appointments also say no however the matches in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.979
 row for novella new realizations 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.720
 are we done a little faster 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.439
 right from risiko the original one 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.329
 imposing the attack the cam cae cam 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.890
 hunting and did not understand however it is no not 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.329
 I believe we are going to the place 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.950
 end of the role play in my opinion the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.500
 role play the video game is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.100
 taking one he took more of his own 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.360
 huge niche of space in the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.860
 day in the sense you were not 3 after there is no 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.719
 ok to proceed from when in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.799
 Meanwhile Thursday after dinner in standards 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.570
 day yes 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.109
 it depends there is no ballarÃ² found one 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.659
 very famous however I will not get 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:55.030
 Tuesday if I live in an eternal Tuesday that 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.490
 beautiful phrase xenon will steal copyright 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.979
 live on an eternal Tuesday the game from 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.659
 role table you do with many people 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.360
 no and in the end it is very difficult 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.979
 the type experience six people that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.170
 they all play a video game together 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.039
 I have never seen things once 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.319
 It is not possible 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.170
 notes take turns and for what you play 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.780
 a mario kart with the screen divided into 4 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.000
 ass and who does it damn if not 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.700
 see you think the multiplayer games by 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 role precisely but here I have a layman empty 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.090
 warcraft yes as well that speech 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.120
 valid last online themes 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.280
 partnership let me play there i am 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.269
 writing I don't like to say some do 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.269
 part of the press 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.959
 what I said we didn't do 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.260
 nothing they assign me anyway 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.000
 shouted he would say he was counted for or not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.139
 role-playing games 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.790
 apart from that they are experiences of 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.900
 worse for the role to play the table 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.329
 I'm with friends is an experience 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.370
 different and much more social is not like 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.290
 being in a guild with a live set is one 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.579
 different thing but then it's okay by a 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.769
 certain point of view there is also another 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.930
 which gives you the chance 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.680
 these video games 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.989
 online rpg online chance to play 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.709
 when maybe you didn't have in life 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.849
 real 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.280
 maybe no one understands enough 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.170
 near or you have no place where 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 go because it happens but it's the house 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.609
 of the friend available to play and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.829
 so games are two things 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.569
 we actually have different ones 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.459
 vampire campaign that stopped 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.709
 more than a year ago and it honors me the time of 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.870
 take it here we talk we don't talk about it 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.700
 of this it is already fabian hit for 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.409
 my fault there isn't at least the little question 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.629
 we will not get what we are fishing for 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.500
 so the patient went to a part 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.459
 of pass dear fish with magnet le 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.900
 we'll have something organized 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:53.409
 very expensive then this question I or 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.629
 decoder or little my height know 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.280
 daniele casa bulb is facing the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.750
 comeback arrest the Arab spring 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.900
 when the current growth will stop 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.819
 Economic envisage to no 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.099
 desirable now I'm second possible 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.769
 me yes it is possible but there will be one 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.229
 incredible repression as it is 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.489
 happening of left-handed blood much of 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:18.829
 more, in my opinion, much more, however, is 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 actually not the point 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.669
 market is going to last 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.509
 is already social I believe rather than not 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.389
 it will be like this 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.819
 I believe it will be the exact opposite 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.620
 then china to the arab world is a lot 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.080
 different between their Arab world and 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.060
 tended by religion 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.690
 much of the Arab world has led 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.169
 from a strong religious presence and to the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.210
 the same time he is not experiencing details 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.129
 wellness boom 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.770
 China on the other hand the only half China 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.900
 for its history, religion is not 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.710
 so for weighting in society 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.509
 Chinese, however, is slowly getting quiet 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.490
 floor enriching with city capital 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.349
 because everything in China had lived in 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.000
 China there is a lot of people in China is 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.099
 so we certainly know what the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.099
 situation the people breaking up 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.750
 he works very hard and so he does 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.550
 not the proletarian revolution 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.960
 no i think what will happen 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.370
 I think it will be what happened 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.229
 in countries that have experienced a wave 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.560
 of sport and wellness therefore e 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.060
 the unions will arrive and slowly 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.590
 workers' rights will come and yes 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.569
 to extend we reduce the hours of work 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.289
 all the process that happened to 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.419
 there is a lot in the western world 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.940
 likely to happen this way however for 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.310
 as for the regime that is still in 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.590
 China for me is very likely that too 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.380
 seek out repressions 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.130
 of being professions that show off but 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.120
 in fact, both how and how the regime is 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.550
 brutal in China but that it is also from 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.810
 there have been few demonstrations that 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.750
 they are made that can be with much 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.610
 strength and difficult then there is mail 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.349
 I think a great revolution in this regard 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.229
 who will expect the regime to 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:00.050
 weaken what will happen because it is 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.819
 very corrupt Chinese regime there is one 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.740
 a little bit longer than the first real one 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.900
 never been a very different speech 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.080
 I think the newspaper component is 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.430
 a big part stack last year a lot 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.500
 bad that the Arab spring 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:18.729
 But I said it at the beginning though 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.729
 Egypt speaks 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.560
 the no b day light because we talk to 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.660
 youtube do not frame the direction there is 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.740
 behind what hid those who paid them 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.610
 read it all 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:37.990
 turn no 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.970
 right then you can polito I answer yes 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.800
 we cannot vote for the region because of it 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.540
 regency we have only one 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.910
 camcorder so it's impossible to do 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.530
 both things 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.960
 or to the director and exact batman you have 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.650
 never seen this rasman and what room 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:58.530
 we are we yes what we have seen 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:00.550
 bum had seen Batman, but Batman 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.070
 however our always have ever 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.720
 having seen any TV series the director does not 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.650
 it is never resumed that this is a 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.160
 telefilm this and are an answer to the 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.660
 your question 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.850
 let's say the director if he wants to come 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:20.080
 here we are in all of them 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:23.650
 you don't know but who is bruce care does not want 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:28.289
 so exactly so the little begins 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.289
 truth see you tomorrow at 18
