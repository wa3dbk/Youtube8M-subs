 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.200
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.700
 and hello to all friends with you again I 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.539
 locker fat and we 'll talk today 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.810
 about new medium tank 4 levels matilda 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.699
 so went analysis of the tank I wanted 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
 would start the most important piece of this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 Tank is his armor 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.320
 she is here just gorgeous and nobody on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.440
 fourth level except tanks 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 having a hole punch cannot break through 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.690
 tank if you specify the numbers then it is a frontal 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.210
 projection but 75 millimeters under good 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 bead angles 70 and feed 55 machine gunners 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 may simply forget that they will 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.590
 punch our Matilda because us 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.410
 can only pierce the covenant machine gun 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 era maybe it's just the back 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.579
 shells 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.340
 it's only gold and no others anymore 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.880
 machine guns can't pierce us besides 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 armor 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 our matilda has a very great 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 gun which has a rate of fire 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.049
 twenty three shots per minute with 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.049
 adrenaline it makes up 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.119
 we have about 30 shots 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.979
 per minute friends with adrenaline we 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.100
 we shoot with reloading approximately 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.080
 one and a half seconds and a half seconds at once 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.729

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.310
 rate of fire even machine guns so not 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.270

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.820
 about which you can pump out for the experience that is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.040
 it is not necessarily in pumping can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 inflict a huge amount of damage and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.689

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.140

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.060

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.020

 And podkalibery already groot the whole one hundred forty 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.019
 five millimeters if we pump in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.139
 Matilda also skills for the crew such 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.280
 as an armored worker or very different skills 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.260
 that is, which are offered to us 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 pumping on medium tanks then ours 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.420
 matilda will just be so 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 they fight that no tank can our 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.959
 matilda just make out at all besides 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.540
 all of this we had a preferential here 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.900
 the level of fights until our friends Matilda not 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.450
 gets to the six it's wonderful this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.810
 tank in every battle to manifest itself 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.330
 full and of course the tank itself is quite a 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.180
 nice engine of course we have here 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 very small , only 190 horse 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.330
 forces and maximum speed at 24 kilometers per hour but 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.310
 since we have a 500 meter card 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.080
 Matilda feels just here 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.260
 great well and the tank itself 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.730

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.550
