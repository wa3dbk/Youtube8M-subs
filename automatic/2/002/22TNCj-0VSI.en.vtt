to<00:06:00.790> be<00:06:00.910> too<00:06:01.090> up<00:06:01.360> myself<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:02.610> reckon<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:03.730> is

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
to be too up myself but I reckon it is

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.330 
to be too up myself but I reckon it is
pretty<00:06:04.150> good<00:06:04.450> luck<00:06:04.810> even<00:06:05.770> though<00:06:05.919> it<00:06:05.950> was

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
pretty good luck even though it was

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.280
