there's<00:01:37.079> no<00:01:37.290> Magneto's<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.880> basically

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there's no Magneto's if you basically

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.030 
there's no Magneto's if you basically
what<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> explained<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> want

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
what the way I explained is if you want

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
what the way I explained is if you want
to<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.189> faster<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> push<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> throttle

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to go faster you push the throttle

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
to go faster you push the throttle
forward<00:01:42.479> doing<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> slowly<00:01:43.740> pull<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
forward doing the slowly pull the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.810 
forward doing the slowly pull the
throttle<00:01:44.220> back

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
throttle back

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
throttle back
there's<00:01:45.210> no<00:01:45.329> mixture<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.380> no<00:01:46.500> prop

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
there's no mixture there's no prop

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
there's no mixture there's no prop
control<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.369> I'll<00:01:47.460> take<00:01:47.640> care<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> pilot

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
control so I'll take care for the pilot

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.230 
control so I'll take care for the pilot
a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> fuel<00:01:50.130> system<00:01:50.549> it's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a little bit about the fuel system it's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639 
a little bit about the fuel system it's
actually<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.720> neat<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually really neat if one of the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.469 
actually really neat if one of the
cylinders<00:01:53.100> its<00:01:53.430> cylinder<00:01:53.759> independent<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.390> if

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
cylinders its cylinder independent so if

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.450 
cylinders its cylinder independent so if
one<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> cylinders<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.470> hot<00:01:56.189> we're

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
one of the cylinders is hot we're

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.880 
one of the cylinders is hot we're

running hot i CH gene it'll be able to
sense<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.930> add<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.079> fuel<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
sense that and actually add more fuel to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.910 
sense that and actually add more fuel to
keep<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.280> long<00:02:02.399> they're<00:02:02.670> cool<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.329> cooler

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
keep that so long they're cool or cooler

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
keep that so long they're cool or cooler
it's<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.450> taken<00:02:06.450> care<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> pod<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.200> have

it's all taken care of the pod is have

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.600 
it's all taken care of the pod is have
to<00:02:07.350> worry<00:02:07.409> about<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> said<00:02:08.220> always<00:02:08.340> do

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
to worry about it like I said always do

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.600 
to worry about it like I said always do
is<00:02:08.849> run<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:10.289> lever<00:02:10.739> back<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.430> forward

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is run that one lever back or forward

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 
is run that one lever back or forward
that<00:02:12.450> takes<00:02:12.629> care<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> whole<00:02:13.020> program<00:02:13.170> for

we<00:02:17.370> will<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.580> able<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.849> use<00:02:17.940> other<00:02:18.299> fuels

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
we will be able to use other fuels
