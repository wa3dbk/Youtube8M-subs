another type of hide glue same stuff but
it's<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.789> called<00:00:27.029> pearl<00:00:27.240> glue<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's it it's called pearl glue and it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
it's it it's called pearl glue and it
comes<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.220> little<00:00:29.340> beads<00:00:35.090> here's<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> glue

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
comes in little beads here's the glue

much<00:00:42.899> quicker<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:44.640> pearl<00:00:44.820> glue<00:00:45.920> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
much quicker than the pearl glue and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
much quicker than the pearl glue and
then<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> add<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:48.180> equal<00:00:48.510> quantity
