00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
hoping like if he would do that it would

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.700 
hoping like if he would do that it would
end<00:02:21.360> up<00:02:21.480> being<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:21.870> later<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> year

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
end up being like later on in the year

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.920 
end up being like later on in the year
like<00:02:23.190> after<00:02:23.490> an<00:02:23.580> MLG<00:02:23.850> or<00:02:24.390> something<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
like after an MLG or something like that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.110 
like after an MLG or something like that
something<00:02:25.230> bigger<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.950> champs<00:02:26.400> make<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
something bigger like on champs make a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.110 
something bigger like on champs make a
chance<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.690> year<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:28.140> final<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:29.120> tournament

I think that would have been like the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.250 
I think that would have been like the
perfect<00:02:32.250> tournament<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.090> retire<00:02:33.480> after<00:02:33.780> even

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
perfect tournament to retire after even

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
perfect tournament to retire after even
win<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.830> lose<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.460> my<00:02:36.060> opinion<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.540> he's<00:02:37.050> doing

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
win or lose in my opinion but he's doing

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.200 
win or lose in my opinion but he's doing
after<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:37.950> g<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.760> stinks<00:02:39.060> but

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
