I've<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.960> chosen<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.469> skill<00:00:44.340> cape<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.360> one

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I've just chosen a skill cape the one

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
I've just chosen a skill cape the one
I've<00:00:45.780> used<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.430> dungeon<00:00:47.430> area<00:00:47.550> masticate

I've used is the dungeon area masticate
but<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.719> doesn't<00:00:48.930> make<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> difference

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
but it really doesn't make a difference

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
but it really doesn't make a difference
which<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> solo

like a dragon square shields or even
another<00:01:43.619> shield<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.270> believe<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.960> tap

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
another shield but I do believe the tap

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
another shield but I do believe the tap
bonuses<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> offender's<00:01:47.820> gonna

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
bonuses on that the offender's gonna

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.179 
bonuses on that the offender's gonna
make<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.049> entire<00:01:49.439> process<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> bit

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
make the entire process it's a bit

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.850 
make the entire process it's a bit
faster<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.060> efficient<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.860> that's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
faster a bit more efficient and that's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
faster a bit more efficient and that's
what<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.100> chosen<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:54.380> for<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> ring<00:01:55.590> I'm

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
what I've chosen it for the ring I'm

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
what I've chosen it for the ring I'm
just<00:01:56.040> used<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> buzzer<00:01:56.520> kering<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.390> not

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
just used to buzzer kering it's not

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.609 
just used to buzzer kering it's not
really<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> make<00:01:58.200> too<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.469> difference

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
really going to make too much difference

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.700 
really going to make too much difference
what<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.259> test<00:02:01.500> ones

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
what you take here and in the test ones

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.109 
what you take here and in the test ones
I've<00:02:01.860> done<00:02:01.979> before<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.549> didn't<00:02:02.820> even

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I've done before but I didn't even

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.060 
I've done before but I didn't even
bother<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> ring<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.799> sure<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
bother with the ring and I'm sure I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
bother with the ring and I'm sure I
won't<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> difference<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.689> if

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
won't know it's a difference so if

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.139 
won't know it's a difference so if
you've<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.409> ring<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:08.069> ahead<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> use<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.789> if

you've got a ring go ahead and use it if

you've got a ring go ahead and use it if
you've<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:09.869> worry<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:11.030> the

weapon i'm using a whip i would

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.809 
weapon i'm using a whip i would
recommend<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.590> you've<00:02:43.739> got<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> rapier<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.640> use

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
recommend if you've got a rapier to use

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.140 
recommend if you've got a rapier to use
it<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.350> if<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:47.070> haven't<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> rapier<00:02:47.910> i

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
it but if you haven't got a rapier i

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.900 
it but if you haven't got a rapier i
would<00:02:48.690> suggest<00:02:48.810> use<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> whip<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:50.850> is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
would suggest use a whip now this is

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.390 
would suggest use a whip now this is
because<00:02:51.530> when<00:02:52.530> you're<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:52.950> melee<00:02:53.190> in

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
because when you're going to be melee in

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
because when you're going to be melee in
the<00:02:53.519> 360's<00:02:54.300> you're<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.080> want<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.350> be

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
the 360's you're going to want to be

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.350 
the 360's you're going to want to be
sucking<00:02:55.920> them<00:02:56.070> anticipate<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.120> same

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
sucking them anticipate that the same

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.650 
sucking them anticipate that the same
speed<00:02:57.750> they're<00:02:58.019> attacking<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.269> now<00:03:00.269> as<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
speed they're attacking you now as the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.350 
speed they're attacking you now as the
whips<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.769> same<00:03:02.010> speed<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.730> makes<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.209> lot

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
whips the same speed it makes it a lot

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.870 
whips the same speed it makes it a lot
easier<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.959> you're<00:03:04.440> using<00:03:04.739> an<00:03:04.980> item<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
easier if you're using an item like a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.810 
easier if you're using an item like a
long<00:03:06.269> sword<00:03:06.570> or<00:03:06.870> even<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> chaotic<00:03:08.430> maul

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
long sword or even like a chaotic maul

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.630 
long sword or even like a chaotic maul
then<00:03:09.660> there's<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.410> greater<00:03:10.890> chance<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.400> you

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
then there's a greater chance of you

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.490 
then there's a greater chance of you
ended<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.209> getting<00:03:12.660> me<00:03:12.840> lead<00:03:13.050> by<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.200> three

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
ended up getting me lead by the three

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.400 
ended up getting me lead by the three
sixes<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.330> although<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.420> may<00:03:15.570> be<00:03:15.630> faster<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
sixes and although it may be faster to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.979 
sixes and although it may be faster to
do<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> cage<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.310> mall<00:03:17.580> it<00:03:18.450> could<00:03:18.690> argue

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
do the cage with the mall it could argue

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.350 
do the cage with the mall it could argue
arguably<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> bit<00:03:20.340> more<00:03:20.489> dangerous<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.209> for

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
arguably be a bit more dangerous and for

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.729 
arguably be a bit more dangerous and for
that<00:03:21.420> reason<00:03:21.480> I'm<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.350> go<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
that reason I'm going to go with the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.069 
that reason I'm going to go with the
whip<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.820> by<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.329> means<00:03:24.360> if<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
whip but by all means if you have a

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.259 
whip but by all means if you have a
rapier<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.709> do<00:03:25.799> strongly<00:03:26.489> recommend<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.060> use

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
rapier I do strongly recommend you use

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.400 
rapier I do strongly recommend you use
it<00:03:27.829> now<00:03:28.829> for<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> inventory<00:03:30.320> there's<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410

money on the shoes peyote like I am and

then<00:04:32.580> we've<00:04:32.790> got<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:34.050> just<00:04:34.260> regular<00:04:34.770> super

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
then we've got to just regular super

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.420 
then we've got to just regular super
attacking<00:04:35.610> super<00:04:35.880> strengths<00:04:36.770> now<00:04:37.770> before<00:04:38.160> you

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
attacking super strengths now before you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.680 
attacking super strengths now before you
enter<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.910> caves<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.890> would<00:04:40.890> recommend<00:04:41.690> that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
enter the caves I would recommend that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.840 
enter the caves I would recommend that
you<00:04:42.840> take<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.080> dose<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.740> your<00:04:44.220> attack<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.730> your

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
you take a dose of your attack and your

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.830 
you take a dose of your attack and your
super<00:04:45.120> strength<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.680> then<00:04:47.580> just<00:04:48.330> bank<00:04:48.570> those

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
super strength and then just bank those

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.120 
super strength and then just bank those
and<00:04:49.290> take<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.250> fresh<00:04:50.970> bardos<00:04:51.510> out<00:04:51.890> that<00:04:52.890> way<00:04:53.070> you

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
and take a fresh bardos out that way you

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.340 
and take a fresh bardos out that way you
get<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> bit<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.670> an<00:04:53.850> extra<00:04:54.090> dose<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:55.170> never

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
get a bit of an extra dose and you never

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.540 
get a bit of an extra dose and you never
know<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.680> could<00:04:55.890> be<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> difference<00:04:56.220> between

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
know it could be the difference between

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.320 
know it could be the difference between
you<00:04:58.160> getting<00:04:59.160> those<00:04:59.310> faster<00:04:59.760> kills<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.240> then

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
you getting those faster kills and then

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.270 
you getting those faster kills and then
get<00:05:00.480> in<00:05:00.570> that<00:05:00.690> cape<00:05:00.900> or<00:05:01.169> not<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.860> always

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
get in that cape or not so I always

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.840 
get in that cape or not so I always
think<00:05:02.580> it's<00:05:02.760> beneficial<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.510> do<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:04.460> now<00:05:05.460> as

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
think it's beneficial to do so now as

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.750 
think it's beneficial to do so now as

you<00:05:15.419> don't<00:05:15.660> really<00:05:15.870> need<00:05:16.140> great<00:05:16.500> stats<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.040> get

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
you don't really need great stats to get

you don't really need great stats to get
to<00:05:17.340> Judd<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.820> can<00:05:18.030> do<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.480> pretty

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
to Judd and you can do it with pretty

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.830 
to Judd and you can do it with pretty
much<00:05:19.140> anything<00:05:19.700> now<00:05:20.700> higher<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.150> better<00:05:21.300> but

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
much anything now higher the better but

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.990 
much anything now higher the better but
for<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.140> setup<00:05:22.380> but<00:05:22.770> i<00:05:22.800> would<00:05:23.220> recommend<00:05:23.880> at

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
points to last for longer so I think

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.990 
points to last for longer so I think
that's<00:05:43.229> everything<00:05:43.650> for<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.070> inventory<00:05:44.820> and

that's everything for the inventory and
equipment<00:05:45.150> setup<00:05:45.630> so<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:47.400> will<00:05:47.550> be<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.729> end

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
equipment setup so this will be the end

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.840 
equipment setup so this will be the end
of<00:05:47.910> part<00:05:48.180> one<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:49.010> next<00:05:50.010> time<00:05:50.160> we'll<00:05:50.370> go<00:05:50.729> into
