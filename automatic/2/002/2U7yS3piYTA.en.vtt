00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.429
 hello everyone we find ourselves for 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.609
 a new video so this time I 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.289
 am on gta san andreas 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.320
 so I'm going to make a video that's going to be 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.089
 the biggest gta jump I think 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.810
 it's bigger jump I'm going to you 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:30.589
 show on the map where it is located is 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.329
 located here on the big bump so I 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.960
 goes up where the map like you 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.270
 must cross 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 there is the whole map there and you have to 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.870
 to go here where there is land and you 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.280
 must ride on this big thing so 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.590
 then I'll just overcome a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.579
 node I've seen markets where is the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.100
 airport and the airport is located or 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.719
 done is there are two white guys in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.550

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.140

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.600

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.140

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.130
 So then there is everything 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:52.729
 I had to say what I had 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:56.780

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.050
 so here I am so I'm going to do 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.300
 the jump with the bike you will see 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 it's really a huge peak at home 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 standards 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.170
 in fact I was passing you must jump 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 exactly the whole thing deep down there not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.240
 too much if you see it all deep down so I 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.960
 will take a lot of momentum and I'm going 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:35.240
 sprint and you're going to see 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.130
 super jump normally have you are 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.680
 forced to die most of the time 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.660
 you die months after you can very 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.690
 of course visible if he left jumped 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 of a cliff but it's huge I'm going 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.770

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:02.840
