trying to rack up as many points as you
can<00:00:17.779> with<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> pistol<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> m14<00:00:20.850> when

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
can with the pistol I get the m14 when

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.420 
can with the pistol I get the m14 when
things<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.600> hairy<00:00:21.869> around<00:00:22.260> round<00:00:23.160> 4<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.380> yeah

things get hairy around round 4 and yeah

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.939 
things get hairy around round 4 and yeah
usually<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> actually<00:00:27.060> buy<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:28.019> round<00:00:28.710> 1

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
usually I actually buy it on round 1

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.439 
usually I actually buy it on round 1
just<00:00:29.189> because<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> money<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.210> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
just because you got the money for it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
just because you got the money for it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
why not if you get overrun you've got a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.450 
why not if you get overrun you've got a
backup<00:00:32.669> weapon<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> yeah<00:00:34.710> after<00:00:34.890> about<00:00:35.250> round

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
backup weapon so yeah after about round

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.549 
backup weapon so yeah after about round
5<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.910> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> go<00:00:36.300> downstairs<00:00:36.559> our

5 you can want to go downstairs our
strategy<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> leave<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.790> crawler<00:00:39.120> around

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
strategy is to leave a crawler around

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530 
strategy is to leave a crawler around
just<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.829> jump<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> elevator<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
just you know jump into the elevator and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
just you know jump into the elevator and
go<00:00:42.899> downstairs<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.280> really

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
go downstairs that's that's really

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
go downstairs that's that's really
important<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> leave<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> crawler<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:46.050> on

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
important to leave the crawler up on

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
important to leave the crawler up on
round<00:00:46.469> 5<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.520> lets<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> way

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
round 5 that lets you get all the way

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.959 
round 5 that lets you get all the way
down<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> random<00:00:49.230> box<00:00:49.379> because

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you say jogging on just by far the next

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789

best<00:01:32.970> thing<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.450> ah<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
best thing to do ah I think that we

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
best thing to do ah I think that we
should<00:01:34.979> probably<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.579> mean<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.210> ended<00:01:36.240> up

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
should probably I mean we ended up

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.270 
should probably I mean we ended up
holding<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> juggernaut<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.070> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
holding off on the juggernaut because we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
holding off on the juggernaut because we
wanted<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> pack<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> punch<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.390> few<00:01:39.420> weapons

which which is a really good idea for
the<00:01:42.840> strategy<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> reveal

the panic room a lot of people had a lot
of<00:01:49.950> questions<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
is on five and we actually found it what

eventually it'll get up to DEFCON five

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.830 
eventually it'll get up to DEFCON five

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
weapons and we actually got two ray guns

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:33.240 
weapons and we actually got two ray guns
and<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:28.200> had<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:31.320> monster<00:04:32.320> ray<00:04:32.410> guns<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:33.040> pack

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
and I had the monster ray guns to pack

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.970 
and I had the monster ray guns to pack
up<00:04:33.340> our<00:04:33.430> guns<00:04:33.820> I'm<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.410> ice<00:04:35.410> gun

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
up our guns I'm the ice gun

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.159 
up our guns I'm the ice gun
I<00:04:36.010> think<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:36.850> called<00:04:37.000> winters<00:04:37.330> Hal<00:04:37.600> which<00:04:38.020> is

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
I think it's called winters Hal which is

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.500 
I think it's called winters Hal which is
showing<00:04:38.890> like<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.340> basically<00:04:40.030> just<00:04:40.330> slows

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
showing like that basically just slows

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.700 
showing like that basically just slows
all<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.750> zombies<00:04:41.020> down<00:04:41.140> but<00:04:41.350> if<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.500> pack

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
all the zombies down but if you pack

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.320 
all the zombies down but if you pack
punch<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.220> they'll<00:04:42.669> pretty<00:04:42.850> much<00:04:42.910> freeze<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
punch it they'll pretty much freeze the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.820 
punch it they'll pretty much freeze the
whole<00:04:43.450> bunch<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:43.900> one<00:04:44.080> bullet<00:04:44.380> just<00:04:44.650> kind<00:04:44.770> of

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
whole bunch and one bullet just kind of

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.560 
whole bunch and one bullet just kind of
shatters<00:04:45.220> all<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.700> them<00:04:45.820> which<00:04:46.360> was

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
shatters all of them which was

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.920 
shatters all of them which was
absolutely<00:04:47.110> amazing<00:04:48.480> so<00:04:50.550> yeah<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.510> other

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
absolutely amazing so yeah the the other

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.900 
absolutely amazing so yeah the the other
thing<00:04:53.230> is<00:04:53.440> if<00:04:53.650> he<00:04:53.860> steals<00:04:54.190> your<00:04:54.340> gun<00:04:54.610> don't

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
because if you kill him you'll actually

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.290 
because if you kill him you'll actually
get<00:04:58.900> all<00:04:59.140> your<00:04:59.350> guns<00:04:59.560> back<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.550> basically<00:05:01.120> the

strategy<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:01.840> him<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.110> everyone<00:05:02.890> wait<00:05:03.100> up<00:05:03.250> on

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
strategy for him is everyone wait up on

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.909 
strategy for him is everyone wait up on
the<00:05:03.490> second<00:05:03.880> level<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.780> main<00:05:05.169> control

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
the second level of that main control

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.820 
the second level of that main control
room<00:05:05.950> where<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.850> panic<00:05:07.630> room<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.229> then

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
room where the panic room is and then

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.950 
room where the panic room is and then
you'll<00:05:08.979> see<00:05:09.220> him<00:05:09.400> warp<00:05:09.729> through<00:05:10.060> one<00:05:10.720> person

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
you'll see him warp through one person

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.570 
you'll see him warp through one person
shoots<00:05:11.350> him<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.680> he'll<00:05:11.830> go<00:05:11.979> after<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.460> one

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
shoots him and he'll go after the one

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.980 
shoots him and he'll go after the one
that<00:05:12.700> shoots<00:05:12.910> him<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.180> even<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.510> person<00:05:13.870> that

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990

that shoots him and even the person that
he's<00:05:14.169> running<00:05:14.680> after<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:15.070> runs<00:05:15.250> around<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
he's running after just runs around the

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.809 
he's running after just runs around the
circle<00:05:15.850> what<00:05:15.970> everyone<00:05:16.240> else<00:05:16.390> does

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
circle what everyone else does
