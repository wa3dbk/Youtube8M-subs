really cool I don't know if there's any

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.240 
really cool I don't know if there's any
significant<00:02:52.090> difference<00:02:52.420> between<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
significant difference between the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.650 
significant difference between the
hazard<00:02:54.610> or<00:02:54.700> version<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.210> Japanese

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
hazard or version and the Japanese

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.600 
hazard or version and the Japanese
version<00:02:56.050> which<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.860> won't<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.250> doing<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
version which I won't be doing a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.260 
version which I won't be doing a
comparison<00:02:57.970> later<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> let's<00:03:00.970> take<00:03:01.240> it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
comparison later on so let's take it

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.890 
comparison later on so let's take it
apart<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:03.340> different<00:03:03.850> modes<00:03:04.390> so

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
apart and see the different modes so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.310 
apart and see the different modes so
this<00:03:05.200> mode<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.000> one<00:03:07.180> mode<00:03:07.390> right<00:03:07.600> here

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.800 

take<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.530> gear<00:03:11.770> wheel<00:03:11.980> off<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.630> just

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
take the gear wheel off and you just

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.260 
take the gear wheel off and you just
flip<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.230> around<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.790> there's<00:03:15.790> another<00:03:16.060> one

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
flip it around and there's another one

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:27.970 
flip it around and there's another one
right<00:03:16.300> there

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.230 

all<00:03:28.980> right<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.400> let's<00:03:29.610> take<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.850> look<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
all right so let's take a look at the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.030 
all right so let's take a look at the
destruction<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.870> do<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> kind<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.380> motor<00:03:35.870> so

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
destruction just do a kind of motor so

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.720 
destruction just do a kind of motor so
one<00:03:38.040> mode<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.430> attack<00:03:39.180> mode<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:40.470> then<00:03:41.310> rotate

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
one mode is attack mode and then rotate

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.240 
one mode is attack mode and then rotate
the<00:03:41.760> piece<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> fusion<00:03:43.230> wheel<00:03:43.380> smash

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the piece of the fusion wheel smash

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.300 
the piece of the fusion wheel smash
attack<00:03:44.610> mode<00:03:47.840> all<00:03:48.840> right<00:03:51.860> let's<00:03:52.860> put<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.160> back

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
attack mode all right let's put it back

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:07.160 
attack mode all right let's put it back
together<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.810> have<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
together so there you have it

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.660 
together so there you have it
hyper<00:04:07.980> blade<00:04:08.310> omega<00:04:08.820> dragonis<00:04:09.030> 85<00:04:09.990> xf<00:04:10.550> let<00:04:11.550> me

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
hyper blade omega dragonis 85 xf let me

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.790 
hyper blade omega dragonis 85 xf let me
do<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.850> quick<00:04:12.150> comparison<00:04:12.870> between<00:04:12.900> this

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
do a quick comparison between this

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.039 
do a quick comparison between this
beyblade<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.200> takara<00:04:16.200> tomy<00:04:16.260> version<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.750> this

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
beyblade and takara tomy version so this

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.750 
beyblade and takara tomy version so this
one<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.900> Takara<00:04:22.320> Tomy<00:04:22.410> version<00:04:23.040> obviously

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
one is the Takara Tomy version obviously

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.930 
one is the Takara Tomy version obviously
there's<00:04:24.000> different<00:04:24.480> colors<00:04:25.580> but<00:04:26.580> pretty<00:04:26.880> much

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
there's different colors but pretty much

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.710 
there's different colors but pretty much
it<00:04:27.240> looks<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.690> same<00:04:27.900> feels<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.650> same<00:04:29.720> there's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
it looks the same feels the same there's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.810 
it looks the same feels the same there's
no<00:04:30.870> significant<00:04:31.470> difference<00:04:31.830> from<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.700> I'm

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
no significant difference from what I'm

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.480 
no significant difference from what I'm
looking<00:04:33.120> at<00:04:33.210> right<00:04:33.419> now<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:34.500> let's<00:04:35.160> take<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
looking at right now but let's take the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.550 
looking at right now but let's take the
pieces<00:04:35.880> apart<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.419> see<00:04:36.990> if<00:04:37.140> there's<00:04:37.350> any

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
pieces apart and see if there's any

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.450 
pieces apart and see if there's any
difference<00:04:37.980> at<00:04:38.130> all

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
difference at all

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.430 
difference at all
now<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.880> both<00:04:39.060> beyblades<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.780> disassembled

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
now that both beyblades are disassembled

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.860 
now that both beyblades are disassembled
let's<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> quick<00:04:41.160> comparison<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:42.330> top<00:04:42.600> row

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
let's do a quick comparison the top row

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.820 
let's do a quick comparison the top row
is<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:44.210> Hasbro<00:04:45.210> hyper<00:04:45.479> blade<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.440> bottom

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
is the Hasbro hyper blade and the bottom

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.540 
is the Hasbro hyper blade and the bottom
is<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.780> Takara<00:04:48.780> Tomy<00:04:48.840> version<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.160> let's<00:04:50.370> take

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
is the Takara Tomy version so let's take

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.540 
is the Takara Tomy version so let's take
a<00:04:50.580> look<00:04:50.790> at<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.120> face<00:04:51.419> bolts<00:04:55.400> nothing<00:04:56.400> too

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
a look at the face bolts nothing too

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.600 
a look at the face bolts nothing too
significant<00:04:58.100> artwork<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.250> little<00:04:59.490> bit

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
significant artwork is a little bit

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.280 
significant artwork is a little bit
different<00:05:00.030> color<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.600> course<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.080> different

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
different color of course is different

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.080 
different color of course is different
but<00:05:01.740> nothing<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.729> much<00:05:02.910> significance<00:05:05.090> Hasbro

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
but nothing of much significance Hasbro

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.780 
but nothing of much significance Hasbro
is<00:05:07.010> tattooed<00:05:08.010> though

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
differences in that one are there

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.720 
differences in that one are there
alright<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.190> onto<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.850> metal<00:05:36.000> wheels<00:05:37.730> pretty

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
alright and onto the metal wheels pretty

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:48.310 
alright and onto the metal wheels pretty

any<00:05:49.320> mold<00:05:49.590> differences<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.370> don't<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.760> see

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
any mold differences I don't really see

any mold differences I don't really see
you<00:05:53.510> know<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:54.600> looks<00:05:54.810> pretty<00:05:55.200> much<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.800> same

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.100 

although<00:05:59.580> I<00:06:00.000> believe<00:06:02.390> Czech<00:06:03.390> economy<00:06:03.540> does

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
although I believe Czech economy does

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:12.800 
although I believe Czech economy does
feel<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.950> little<00:06:05.070> bit<00:06:05.280> thicker<00:06:06.260> but<00:06:11.540> let's<00:06:12.540> see

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
feel a little bit thicker but let's see

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.460 
feel a little bit thicker but let's see
if<00:06:12.840> they<00:06:13.080> really<00:06:13.290> are<00:06:14.840> it<00:06:15.840> could<00:06:16.020> be<00:06:16.140> just<00:06:16.380> the

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
if they really are it could be just the

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.100 
if they really are it could be just the
paint<00:06:16.860> on<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:19.400> on<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:20.670> right<00:06:21.060> here<00:06:21.270> that

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
paint on the on this right here that

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.980 
paint on the on this right here that
makes<00:06:22.290> it<00:06:22.410> feel<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.650> little<00:06:22.980> thick<00:06:23.810> but<00:06:24.810> other

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
makes it feel a little thick but other

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
makes it feel a little thick but other
than<00:06:25.230> that<00:06:26.210> no<00:06:27.210> difference<00:06:27.810> they're<00:06:28.800> probably

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
than that no difference they're probably

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.940 
than that no difference they're probably
pretty<00:06:29.490> much<00:06:29.670> the<00:06:29.970> same<00:06:30.150> anyway<00:06:30.560> and<00:06:31.560> onto<00:06:31.830> the

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
pretty much the same anyway and onto the

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.560 
pretty much the same anyway and onto the
other<00:06:31.980> metal<00:06:32.670> wheel<00:06:34.670> of<00:06:35.670> course<00:06:36.000> this<00:06:36.360> one's

other metal wheel of course this one's

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.160 
other metal wheel of course this one's
unpainted<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:38.120> don't<00:06:39.120> see<00:06:39.300> any<00:06:39.480> difference<00:06:39.660> in

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
unpainted I don't see any difference in

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.520 
unpainted I don't see any difference in
this<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:40.710> might<00:06:40.860> as<00:06:40.920> well

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.760 

don't<00:06:48.530> see<00:06:48.710> any<00:06:48.860> moral<00:06:49.100> differences<00:06:49.610> either

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.160 

even<00:06:54.770> has<00:06:54.920> all<00:06:55.100> the<00:06:55.250> same<00:06:55.490> indentations<00:06:56.330> like

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
even has all the same indentations like

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.270 
even has all the same indentations like
this<00:06:57.320> little<00:06:57.590> arrow<00:06:58.030> pointing<00:06:59.030> down<00:07:00.130> so<00:07:01.130> it's

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
this little arrow pointing down so it's

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.930 
this little arrow pointing down so it's
pretty<00:07:01.490> much<00:07:01.610> the<00:07:02.120> same<00:07:02.360> just<00:07:02.900> the<00:07:03.700> paint<00:07:04.700> is

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
pretty much the same just the paint is

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:13.150 
pretty much the same just the paint is
the<00:07:05.120> only<00:07:05.330> difference<00:07:05.690> now<00:07:06.220> the<00:07:07.220> track<00:07:07.580> 85<00:07:12.160> not

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
the only difference now the track 85 not

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.550 
the only difference now the track 85 not
much<00:07:13.310> difference<00:07:15.220> and<00:07:16.570> the<00:07:17.570> bottom<00:07:17.900> XF<00:07:18.350> or

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
much difference and the bottom XF or

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.280 
much difference and the bottom XF or
extreme<00:07:19.280> flat<00:07:19.990> the<00:07:20.990> Hasbro<00:07:21.410> extreme<00:07:21.740> flat<00:07:21.980> is

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
extreme flat the Hasbro extreme flat is

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.570 
extreme flat the Hasbro extreme flat is
reinforced<00:07:24.290> right<00:07:24.770> here<00:07:24.980> it's<00:07:25.190> a<00:07:25.280> little<00:07:25.370> bit

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
reinforced right here it's a little bit

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.090 
reinforced right here it's a little bit
more<00:07:25.670> filled<00:07:25.970> up<00:07:26.230> it<00:07:27.230> prevents<00:07:27.830> it<00:07:27.950> from

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
more filled up it prevents it from

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.820 
more filled up it prevents it from
breaking<00:07:28.340> easily<00:07:29.330> like<00:07:30.110> this<00:07:30.140> one<00:07:30.500> right<00:07:30.620> here

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
breaking easily like this one right here

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.430 
breaking easily like this one right here
is<00:07:30.920> a<00:07:30.950> little<00:07:31.280> bit<00:07:31.750> thinner<00:07:32.750> than<00:07:33.020> that<00:07:33.170> one

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
is a little bit thinner than that one

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.530 
is a little bit thinner than that one
right<00:07:33.590> there<00:07:35.290> so<00:07:36.290> nothing<00:07:36.650> too<00:07:37.540> significant

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540 
right there so nothing too significant

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.410 
right there so nothing too significant
nothing<00:07:38.930> that's<00:07:39.280> though<00:07:40.280> that<00:07:40.940> won't<00:07:41.090> really

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:41.420 
nothing that's though that won't really

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.070 
nothing that's though that won't really
mess<00:07:41.630> up<00:07:41.660> the<00:07:41.870> game<00:07:42.200> or<00:07:42.560> anything<00:07:42.860> like<00:07:43.160> that

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
mess up the game or anything like that

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.040 
mess up the game or anything like that
yeah<00:07:45.080> that's<00:07:45.350> about<00:07:45.500> it<00:07:45.620> for<00:07:45.920> the<00:07:45.980> comparison

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.050 
yeah that's about it for the comparison

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.450 
yeah that's about it for the comparison
