00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.229 
thought I would make sirs pictures with
that<00:00:57.010> when<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.039> was<00:00:58.250> first<00:00:58.519> there<00:00:58.699> there<00:00:59.149> were

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
that when I was first there there were

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.610 
that when I was first there there were
no<00:00:59.269> people<00:00:59.539> there<00:00:59.899> for<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> first<00:01:00.410> three

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
no people there for the first three

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.040 
no people there for the first three
weeks<00:01:00.769> I<00:01:00.980> saw<00:01:01.160> three<00:01:01.430> national<00:01:01.820> guardsmen<00:01:02.269> and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
weeks I saw three national guardsmen and

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.620 
weeks I saw three national guardsmen and
that<00:01:03.230> was<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.559> people<00:01:04.399> weren't<00:01:04.879> around<00:01:05.179> it<00:01:05.509> was

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
that was it people weren't around it was

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.940 
that was it people weren't around it was
it<00:01:05.869> was<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.170> post-apocalyptic<00:01:06.530> movie<00:01:07.399> I

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
it was like a post-apocalyptic movie I

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.889 
it was like a post-apocalyptic movie I
thought<00:01:09.950> about<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.280> open<00:01:10.490> fire<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.880> 1991<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
thought about the open fire in 1991 and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.870 
thought about the open fire in 1991 and
that<00:01:12.050> was<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.410> devastated<00:01:13.039> landscape<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
that was a devastated landscape but the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.840 
that was a devastated landscape but the
scale<00:01:14.270> was<00:01:15.020> radically<00:01:15.590> different<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.789> is

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
scale was radically different this is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.210 
scale was radically different this is
the<00:01:17.060> kind<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.330> scale<00:01:17.929> where<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:18.830> could<00:01:19.009> drive

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the kind of scale where you could drive

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.279 
the kind of scale where you could drive
for<00:01:19.429> days<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.970> not<00:01:20.119> see<00:01:20.300> another<00:01:20.690> human<00:01:20.899> being

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
for days and not see another human being

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.740 
for days and not see another human being
in<00:01:21.590> front<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.340> me<00:01:22.460> behind<00:01:22.820> me<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:23.240> destroyed

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
in front of me behind me just destroyed

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.880 
in front of me behind me just destroyed
and<00:01:24.079> no<00:01:24.740> people<00:01:25.060> done<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.560> ended<00:01:27.560> up<00:01:27.619> making

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
and no people done I ended up making

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.130 
and no people done I ended up making
about<00:01:28.130> 2,000<00:01:28.970> photographs<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.630> pocket

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
about 2,000 photographs with the pocket

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.999 
about 2,000 photographs with the pocket
camera<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:32.170> realized<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.439> there<00:01:33.619> was<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.770> lot

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
camera and realized that there was a lot

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.920 
camera and realized that there was a lot
of<00:01:34.040> amazing<00:01:34.399> pictures<00:01:35.119> there<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.570> were<00:01:35.689> very

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
of amazing pictures there that were very

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.380 
of amazing pictures there that were very
raw<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.680> seemed<00:01:37.189> very<00:01:37.340> appropriate<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:38.210> us

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
raw and seemed very appropriate to us

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.899 
raw and seemed very appropriate to us
looking<00:01:38.720> at<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.380> within<00:01:39.920> those<00:01:40.159> 2000

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
looking at and within those 2000

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.800 
looking at and within those 2000
photographs<00:01:41.390> there<00:01:42.229> was<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.680> subset<00:01:43.460> of

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
photographs there was a subset of

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.149 
photographs there was a subset of
photographs<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.990> people<00:01:45.079> writing<00:01:45.979> messages

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
photographs of people writing messages

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.530 
photographs of people writing messages
on<00:01:46.610> their<00:01:46.939> walls<00:01:47.149> with<00:01:47.360> spray<00:01:47.719> paint<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:50.450> they

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
on their walls with spray paint and they

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.539 
on their walls with spray paint and they
wrote<00:01:50.719> him<00:01:50.750> on<00:01:50.930> their<00:01:51.110> homes<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.710> their<00:01:52.280> cars

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
wrote him on their homes on their cars

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.090 
wrote him on their homes on their cars
on<00:01:52.850> trees<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:57.290> realized<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.799> there<00:01:57.950> was<00:01:58.070> a

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
on trees and I realized that there was a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.340 
on trees and I realized that there was a
complete<00:01:58.520> narrative<00:01:59.090> about<00:01:59.689> what<00:02:00.079> was<00:02:00.200> going

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
complete narrative about what was going

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.770 
complete narrative about what was going
on<00:02:00.439> Katrina<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.130> their<00:02:01.520> words<00:02:01.880> not<00:02:02.539> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
on Katrina in their words not the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.510 
on Katrina in their words not the
photographer's<00:02:03.439> words<00:02:03.710> not<00:02:04.130> all<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
photographer's words not all the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.850 
photographer's words not all the
editorial<00:02:04.909> views<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.960> we've<00:02:06.079> seen<00:02:06.500> all

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
editorial views that we've seen all

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.759 
editorial views that we've seen all
along<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:08.090> their<00:02:08.509> words<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.350> thought<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.679> was

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
along but their words I thought it was

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.780 
along but their words I thought it was
really<00:02:09.950> important<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.459> out<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:12.790> went

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
really important to get that out I went

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
really important to get that out I went
through<00:02:13.910> all<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> pictures<00:02:14.299> I<00:02:14.930> printed<00:02:15.380> them

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
through all the pictures I printed them

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.729 
through all the pictures I printed them
like<00:02:15.890> crazy<00:02:16.370> fast<00:02:16.640> lay<00:02:17.540> them<00:02:17.750> out<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
like crazy fast lay them out then the

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.740

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
sub-themes within the larger narrative

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.780 
sub-themes within the larger narrative
came<00:02:21.200> out<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:22.130> knew<00:02:22.250> there<00:02:22.400> was<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.519> book<00:02:22.760> I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790
