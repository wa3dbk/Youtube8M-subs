00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
achievement is probably easiest done if

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
you can have infinite grenades and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.289 
you can have infinite grenades and
that'll<00:00:37.899> make<00:00:37.929> it<00:00:38.109> so<00:00:38.409> much<00:00:38.469> easier<00:00:38.909> use<00:00:39.909> sin

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:40.299 
that'll make it so much easier use sin

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.500 
that'll make it so much easier use sin
the<00:00:41.019> bandana<00:00:41.799> skull<00:00:42.159> has<00:00:42.429> good<00:00:42.729> synergy<00:00:42.999> with

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
the bandana skull has good synergy with

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.689 
the bandana skull has good synergy with
boom<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.710> that'll<00:00:45.100> make<00:00:45.219> getting

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
boom that so that'll make getting

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.439 
boom that so that'll make getting
through<00:00:45.999> this<00:00:46.149> part<00:00:46.659> easier<00:00:48.120> notably<00:00:49.120> you

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
through this part easier notably you

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.509 
through this part easier notably you
have<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.780> do<00:00:49.929> this<00:00:50.049> on<00:00:50.289> heroic<00:00:50.829> difficulty<00:00:51.249> or

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
have to do this on heroic difficulty or

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.419 
have to do this on heroic difficulty or
higher<00:00:51.819> so<00:00:52.719> I've<00:00:53.109> done<00:00:53.379> it<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.589> heroic<00:00:54.100> so<00:00:54.280> i'll

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
higher so I've done it on heroic so i'll

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.160 
higher so I've done it on heroic so i'll
die<00:00:54.639> less<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.209> you'll<00:00:55.389> still<00:00:55.539> see<00:00:55.839> me<00:00:55.869> die

for<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.100> for<00:02:00.249> the<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.460> reason<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:01.229> he's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
for just for the one reason that he's

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.020 
for just for the one reason that he's
got<00:02:02.409> an<00:02:02.499> energy<00:02:02.859> sword<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.700> don't<00:02:03.880> want

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
got an energy sword and you don't want

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.639 
got an energy sword and you don't want
to<00:02:04.090> get<00:02:04.210> your<00:02:04.299> explosives<00:02:04.899> too<00:02:05.049> close<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.530> him

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
to get your explosives too close to him

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.150 
to get your explosives too close to him
so<00:02:07.259> yeah<00:02:08.259> you're<00:02:08.410> gonna<00:02:08.500> have<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.830> watch<00:02:08.950> out

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
so yeah you're gonna have to watch out

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.030 
so yeah you're gonna have to watch out
for<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.340> one<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.869> died<00:02:10.869> again<00:02:11.470> right<00:02:11.769> here

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
for that one I died again right here

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.130 
for that one I died again right here
because<00:02:12.970> i'm<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> bit<00:02:13.599> foolish<00:02:13.840> but

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
because i'm a bit foolish but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.170 
because i'm a bit foolish but
well<00:02:17.140> maybe<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.530> don't<00:02:17.770> die<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.220> anywho<00:02:21.180> I've

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
well maybe I don't die but anywho I've

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.570 
well maybe I don't die but anywho I've
just<00:02:22.450> sped<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.380> if<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:24.010> didn't<00:02:24.370> it'd

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
just sped it up because if I didn't it'd

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.640 
just sped it up because if I didn't it'd
be<00:02:24.820> like<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.090> eight<00:02:25.420> minute<00:02:25.750> long<00:02:25.900> video<00:02:26.110> so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
be like a eight minute long video so

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.130 
be like a eight minute long video so
I've<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.190> made<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.520> four<00:02:27.760> minutes<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.240> just

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
I've just made it four minutes now just

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
I've just made it four minutes now just
just<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.620> demonstration<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.990> pretty

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
just for demonstration it's pretty

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.830 
just for demonstration it's pretty
obvious<00:02:32.740> what<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> got<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.250> do<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:34.540> here's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
obvious what you got to do see here's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.910 
obvious what you got to do see here's
the<00:02:34.900> part<00:02:35.170> where<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.350> can<00:02:35.470> have<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.740> most

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the part where you can have the most

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.680 
the part where you can have the most
trouble<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.340> eat<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:37.270> not<00:02:37.390> even<00:02:37.420> going

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
trouble with eat and it's not even going

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.660 
trouble with eat and it's not even going
to<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.020> much<00:02:38.170> trouble<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.460> do

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
to be that much trouble but if you do

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.200 
to be that much trouble but if you do
have<00:02:39.850> any<00:02:39.880> form<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.450> trouble<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.200> part

have any form of trouble with this part

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.040 
have any form of trouble with this part
you're<00:02:43.210> probably<00:02:43.420> gonna<00:02:43.630> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> lot<00:02:44.020> of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you're probably gonna have a lot of

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.870 
you're probably gonna have a lot of
trouble<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> bit<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.550> rookie

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
trouble there that was a bit of a rookie

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.330 
trouble there that was a bit of a rookie
move<00:02:46.060> by<00:02:47.020> me<00:02:47.260> throwing<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:47.950> frag

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
move by me throwing that the frag

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
move by me throwing that the frag
grenade<00:02:48.700> at<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.000> ground<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.950> invisible<00:02:54.220> eats

might<00:02:54.880> give<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> bit<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.630> hassle<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
might give you a bit of a hassle but I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.570 
might give you a bit of a hassle but I
it's<00:02:59.050> probably<00:02:59.410> just<00:02:59.560> depends<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:00.550> you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
it's probably just depends on how you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.210 
it's probably just depends on how you
play<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.540> elites<00:03:02.200> aren't<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.980> hard

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
play the elites aren't really that hard

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.130 
play the elites aren't really that hard
they<00:03:03.490> only<00:03:03.640> take<00:03:03.850> one<00:03:04.090> frag<00:03:04.420> grenade<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> kill

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
they only take one frag grenade to kill

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.310 
they only take one frag grenade to kill
on<00:03:05.380> heroic<00:03:05.860> difficulty<00:03:06.959> or<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.170> can<00:03:08.290> use

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
on heroic difficulty or you can use

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.810 
on heroic difficulty or you can use
plasma<00:03:08.740> grenades<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.490> they'll<00:03:09.640> die

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
plasma grenades and they'll die

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.190 
plasma grenades and they'll die
instantly<00:03:10.330> as<00:03:10.480> well<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.790> um<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.900> pretty

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
instantly as well but um it's a pretty

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.770 
instantly as well but um it's a pretty
easy<00:03:14.410> treatment<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:16.240> shouldn't<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.630> too

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
easy treatment and it shouldn't be too

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.570 
easy treatment and it shouldn't be too
hard<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.110> miss<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:17.590> you're<00:03:17.740> using<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.040> bandana

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.110 
hard to miss if you're using the bandana
skull<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.690> boom<00:03:19.870> skull<00:03:23.850> well<00:03:24.850> it's<00:03:25.030> not
