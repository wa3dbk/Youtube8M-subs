00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
also your headphone jack so the reason

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
also your headphone jack so the reason
why<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.829> slit<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
why I see this little slit here is to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
why I see this little slit here is to
basically<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> difference<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.500> be

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
basically make up the difference to be

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.399 
basically make up the difference to be
able<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.070> cover<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.939> tops<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> bottom<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.990> the
