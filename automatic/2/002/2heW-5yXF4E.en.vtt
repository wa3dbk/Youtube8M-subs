00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.490
 Years explain welcome to a new episode of Technik Stream 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.340
 today it should go to the good piece 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.369
 the Archos little Leitha as a thousand w 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:11.899
 that is a 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:17.470
 wireless Carlos Tevez himself from OZ that comes in boxing so far 

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:18.699
 Percent 5 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.859
 they have reminded the point again 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.319
 Invensys front-run seat Soost 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.699
 you can get ten euros 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.849
 It can be folded and then take in the box 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.140
 if I do that al-islam cause 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.000
 then a little more complicated 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.490
 Yes together 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
 which is natural and I'll turn it off 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.200
 Do not be put off by this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.630
 a foldable 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.450
 in the bag of course this is a bit stable but it is really 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.370
 Not 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.700
 to have ridden this country well so well 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.580
 here is about this boom again 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.070
 Altenmünster additional Bühler that Inter still not everything as tight 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.230
 keeps 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.100
 then we open up here 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.870
 a cushion something really - you see Co 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.870
 there is good demand not too strong 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.300
 as well as the crossing on the earpieces say that too 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
 sufficient 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 that is not so thick enough 40 percent 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 Chances and Cell what it means for who 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.650
 Of course, first to turn it on and off, I should of course in 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 many if you do not use it 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.690
 if you get the lot out fast I have to say that you do that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.400
 that means one more 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 it flashes 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 as usual and not Neil Wallis and 4 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
 Munich 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.439
 I had to connect the receiver of the TIG to the PC 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.240
 Now everyone expects us to say something, of course, this one 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.460
 Normally Mertesdorf green means the connection is there 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 and stand somewhere 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.840
 Mimi's application, of course, still lurking loud online 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.150
 and above a button percent for connecting to the link 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.250
 built what you have to do only once 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.390
 After that, one finds that March will make the headset march up the connection 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.809
 turn on and off again 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.520
 already around the round a connection for 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.970
 at the mini USB cable over which then the last one is practically loaded 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:22.189
 which also intelligently solves it if della falls the current it really 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.639
 you can do everything 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.779
 connect the last team via Sarah usb cable to the computer one must have 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.639
 make it clear but can still make calls 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.639
 there is something about it is nice that Tales now afford 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.159
 but now it did not get that way 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.230
 but it's certainly a meter long humming per 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.669
 if you have a problem as synonymous s.and that the calculator is not right on 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.229
 understand it has to bleed you either 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.720
 a transfer too late but only temporary 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.969
 in the wireless USB 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.969
 he was still open at times 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.790
 Some perpetrators say sound quality so I'm serving as the people 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.459
 pure microphone of 3 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.939
 it's not that important right now 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.310
 but I've already sealed or heard about it in the game - the 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.459
 Quality really enough more than adequate 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.689
 It costs currently Wars and 45 Euro may it is really very good 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.419
 The range is mild at Arsenal 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.499
 two levels so far 15 to 20 meters tackle where the agrees on 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.109
 Pull open spaces with you 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.909
 I have here when I notice in the two three men two doors in between 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.679
 St but no difference so noted 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.659
 The transmission rate with two point four here should be his 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.799
 are sufficient to record annually 0 interfering signals 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.040
 The sooner the Ryanair gets used to, the time has come for music 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.739
 Responsibly give Sister Act with 8 hours 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.310
 because of course one of the microphone will help with that 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.369
 probably be a bit bigger though 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.369
 So it would have been at least three four hours anyway 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.489
 Radio longer wine barrels their piece now 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.279
 Andy is too long 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.400
 but what about time is given here with up to three months last year 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.969
 Coal is 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.279
 but I love you crime mistakes that you have to go to school 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.259
 or to work that's why 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.380
 Franz Kalla 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.449
 that's about 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.449
 after two and a half hours, according to Asus fully charged 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.710
 Japan has no problems with that either 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.839
 nice is that I believe since did not mention if you betrayed now 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
 press this switch Manuel for a while 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.960
 then people to blue 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.450
 that means that with great vocal manufacturer Baxter Dury Copper 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.199
 can reach 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.370
 and according to the manual there is also a possibility about the l these keys 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.440
 there were talks to accept accepting and ending percentages 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.380
 that also tried a factual zig but not until the end 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.900
 Light up 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.689
 So, as I said, the range is sufficient 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.689
 Office hours are also very good the quality for confusion 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.809
 the only thing is that by more me which starts all the time on whether 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.150
 want to inform to go around the ears 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.949
 furthermore, and still not from the three hours or so a game 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.930
 that's also possible with him 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.189
 and plugs or whatever else 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.029
 yes so as I said 45 euros currently Beamer son the wind farm I in the 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.719
 info-box had to order then and 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.469
 again succeeds two manufacturers page 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.719
 and then i hope i could have kept you so i just really can 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.539
 Highly recommend 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.729
 and Borchers Littmann I hope I could help you and 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.639
 He was still NGOs
