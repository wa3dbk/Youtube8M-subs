00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello everyone today we will 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.300
 cook chicken soup with pasta 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 for this we need 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.509
 directly chicken and here already 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.789
 put it in the pot today it will be 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 drumsticks further potato vegetables such as 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.810
 carrot onion in well here in such 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.789
 a product that I break if you have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
 there are already immediately small they even 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 probably better fit and there is seasoning 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 and so for this we have already lowered the chicken 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.260
 this carcass potatoes poked around and here I am 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 such a bowl seems to me 5 pieces big 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 potatoes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 that's quite aggressive enough 3 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.250
 adult person so on here alone 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.379
 carrot and lonely carrot can 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 rub as you like more on me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 more like this here too 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 chop onion cut as medium and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.969
 small, small-sized without a block, the juice will be 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 just not tasty so surely onions 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 add omit our from will fit 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.860
 which we will break under the shallow 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.530
 vermicelli is why it is called chicken 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.090
 noodles soup 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 by the way there is still such special noodles 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.729
 for soups stores she sells such 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 so to say well, that's such a tidy 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 because it is your 1 plus 5 looks like home 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 here the assistant already set up a little 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.810
 so just 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 The beauty of this multicooker is that to me 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.630
 you can immediately under what let never 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.509
 the pot you cook started the meat so that it 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 there was then sweat vegetables then at the end everything 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.670
 the rest here right away you can even 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.680
 commentators we have our assistant 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.080
 young cook he comments too 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.140
 cooking soup to at least some 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.140
 the background was yes yes it is we are cooking soup for 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.830
 all family 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:17.720
 now living here this victory so to speak 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:22.100
 so and a little more added then we 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.050
 one potato will turn out here as if on 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.360
 taste and color as they say comrades not 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.290
 so if you like these heads 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.440
 and at least a potato so that one meat was 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.870
 yes what is it 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.640
 she help so we go eat this 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.460
 by the way why do we do the slow cooker 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.000
 it will be the same effect as in Russian 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.460
 ovens 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.660
 then before grandmothers put chicken 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.820
 soups in pots 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.330
 right here just as well on pro dance and and 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.770
 so Salem added a little bit now I 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.770
 add a little more salt 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.960
 so on purpose why do we 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.120
 seasoning Zimin 3 cloves necessarily 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.190
 seasoning greens so here we have 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:19.210
 seasoning and sedrika natural 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:21.320
 components we need to eat dill 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.700
 if you still have parsley then 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.700
 add parsley 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.590
 blood will give flavor to this chicken 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.510
 Soup rustic that's my favorite 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.000
 the most seasoning it to all dishes 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:46.209
 I fit well just a little or 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.040
 I will complete here a mixture of peppers 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:54.920
 now you are necessary is already in 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.120
 property is already the first inhaled pepper 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.030
 a little bit all that's what we are 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.670
 now did we pour the usual cold 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.010
 water at the maximum mark which is 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.200
 each bun in each multicooker and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.200
 so neatly pour 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.049
 be sure to look us over the mark 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.340
 they didnâ€™t come out now 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.500
 I'll add a little bit 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.400
 very little bit 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400
 cold water 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:38.529
 as a finishing touch 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.819
 all here is the maximum mark I think here 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:47.649
