00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
drill is occurred if you see this hole

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
drill is occurred if you see this hole
minutes<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.230> large<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> hole<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.280> pretty

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
minutes be large the hole is pretty

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
minutes be large the hole is pretty
large<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.000> look<00:00:54.180> all<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.480> through

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
large but you look all the way through

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
large but you look all the way through
there<00:00:55.199> you'll<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.059> two

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there you'll see that it's actually two

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
there you'll see that it's actually two
holes<00:00:57.590> one<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.980> side<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.550> from

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
holes one from this side and one from

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
holes one from this side and one from
this<00:00:59.879> side<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.359> sort<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> meet<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
this side and they sort of meet in the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.459 
this side and they sort of meet in the
middle

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
middle

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
middle
and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> middle<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and then really in the middle you have

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
and then really in the middle you have
to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.570> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.870> bends<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to get kind of bends in there and so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
to get kind of bends in there and so
forth<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.489> modern<00:01:06.390> B<00:01:06.630> no<00:01:06.840> matter<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:07.140> old<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
forth a modern B no matter how old this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
forth a modern B no matter how old this
looks<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.010> looks<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.939> old<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.479> Jasper

looks this looks very very old is Jasper
being<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.790> through

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
being here but if you look right through

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.429 
being here but if you look right through
that<00:01:12.180> you'll<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.689> sonic<00:01:13.110> drill

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that you'll see that it's sonic drill

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
that you'll see that it's sonic drill
that's<00:01:13.650> straight<00:01:14.010> through<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.210> side<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's straight through from one side to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
that's straight through from one side to
the<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.290> exacts<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.009> exactly

the other that all exacts is all exactly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.810 
the other that all exacts is all exactly
the<00:01:17.430> same<00:01:17.520> sized<00:01:18.030> drill<00:01:18.869> hole<00:01:19.250> most<00:01:20.250> important

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the same sized drill hole most important

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.340 
the same sized drill hole most important

people have the entrance wound and an
exit<00:01:30.600> wound<00:01:30.750> does<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> work<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.500> they'll<00:01:32.369> be

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
exit wound does it work so they'll be

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
exit wound does it work so they'll be
there'll<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.070> larger<00:01:35.790> piece

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there'll be a little bit larger piece

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
there'll be a little bit larger piece
this<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.270> ston

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this one here you can see that's a ston

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.980 
this one here you can see that's a ston
bayview<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.890> way<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.299> drilling<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
bayview and this way the drilling that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
bayview and this way the drilling that
length<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> drill<00:01:43.860> makes<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> difference

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
length of the drill makes the difference

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
length of the drill makes the difference
for<00:01:45.030> instance<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> garden<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.280> to

smaller<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.440> other<00:02:30.590> side<00:02:30.920> would

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
smaller and then the other side would

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.550 
smaller and then the other side would
have<00:02:31.250> had<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.640> same<00:02:31.880> thing<00:02:32.300> which<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.260> large

this is small on the outside like this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.440 
this is small on the outside like this
is<00:02:40.280> much<00:02:40.430> larger<00:02:40.610> than<00:02:40.820> some<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> sickness

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
is much larger than some of the sickness

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.000 
is much larger than some of the sickness
and<00:02:42.160> there's<00:02:43.160> something<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.090> there<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
and there's something in there that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.800 
and there's something in there that
prevents<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.160> glass<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.630> thing<00:02:47.780> that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
prevents that glass but one thing that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.890 
prevents that glass but one thing that
usually<00:02:48.170> will<00:02:48.470> be<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.620> bronze<00:02:48.950> rod<00:02:55.840> show<00:02:56.840> you

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
usually will be a bronze rod show you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 
usually will be a bronze rod show you
them<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.320> meet<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.830> show<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.160> how<00:02:58.489> those<00:02:58.760> were

them to meet and show you how those were

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.790 
them to meet and show you how those were
made<00:02:59.209> because<00:02:59.570> that's<00:03:00.170> very<00:03:00.530> fascinating

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
made because that's very fascinating

that's<00:03:01.340> why<00:03:01.580> actually<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.239> got<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.019> collect<00:03:03.170> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
that's why actually I got to collect the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.960 
that's why actually I got to collect the
beads<00:03:03.560> because<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.280> technology

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
big and it goes into a tiny hole so the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.020 
big and it goes into a tiny hole so the
