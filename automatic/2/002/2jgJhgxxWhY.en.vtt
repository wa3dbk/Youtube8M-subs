00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 we had a small garden that 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.230
 we produced very few things would judge him 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.809
 the only thing we could have to stay 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.990
 small and yet in this that already 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.990
 we made bigger already we have great 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.900
 variety if you put what I feel 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:26.039
 because we sow tomato radish 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.039
 chilies tomato chard broccoli 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.410
 spinach beans jotero with 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.500
 and wason 3 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.750
 santi we did not have the fixed space and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.150
 now it's with the fabric and everything already 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.400
 we have to protect them from animals 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.680
 of all zones and saved 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.650
 because before I had to have our 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.030
 vegetables before we had no garden before 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.040
 to have the vegetables we had to 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.940
 go away to buy them sometimes 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.059
 the cars entered the chileros 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.549
 vegetables already of black waters I think 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.520
 because the vegetable not the water was not no 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.039
 it's like an organizer 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 and we use it for the basics for the house 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.950
 to eat the vegetable that we like 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.829
 and then now what exclusive are we going to have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.220
 a little more to be able to sell this one 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.490
 little bit 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.290
 that is , it will give us more harvest than 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 another or that is the other nothing else we have for 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.330
 eat and we do not have to sell but 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 Now we already have to sell 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.880
 the risk had we have to walk with 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.149
 some boats 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.700
 a 20-liter pot and a pot of 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.220
 bunnies to be able to play and now not 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 because nothing else with the river that makes me 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.700
 the first covered because it is already going to water 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.710
 there are only other things that then now that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.679
 we already have it be more protected so 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.770
 same mesh and then the mesh shadow 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.259
 also from water or ice and the other 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.569
 we had it with wooden stick that 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.240
 let's bring the mountain to do our 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.340
 flag to protect it little bit and 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.080
 Well now it's very different already you have 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.810
 all this is well protected from 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.780
 anything and the other then what 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.569
 we had more nice little of me 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.900
 cistern to the water that to stop of the sky of 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 the wta follows the water that rains is water 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.120
 it helps me 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.790
 my tank fills me up to water 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 my garden to wash for 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.710
 wash dishes and water my worms 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.420
 and my waste worms 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.850
 can make man if you've done the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.850
 organic fertilizer here to the body 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.620
 us instead of using chemical things 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.060
 let's use earthworm humus 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.319
 as a subscription 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.810
 It was all natural 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.079
 we already have more knowledge more 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.430
 experience and already with this new garden 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:09.209
 we are already putting it into practice 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.640
 and thinking about things the future of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.190
 our children more than anything 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.990
 I love how you eat here tomatoes 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.320
 said dining room 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.300
 and so they love it and they love it 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.300
 eat the tomato like this 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.459
 but 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.709
 Well, they are very grateful for all 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.319
 the supports that they give us since then we 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.330
 they serve so that our children are 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.459
 well nourished the family itself is a 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
 family project which is going to 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.640
 help have our own 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.400
 healthy clean vegetables and then many 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.010
