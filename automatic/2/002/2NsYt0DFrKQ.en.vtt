00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 You can get three ex towels from everyone 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 conceivable and unthinkable directions 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.269
 stretch out 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.860
 Today I'll show you a way you 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.519
 knit triangular scarf from the side 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.389
 can 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 I use this wool but for it 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.830
 Actually it does not matter which one did you want 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.189
 you can use any 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.560
 I use 450 meters of this 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.890
 wool used this scarf is very 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 long I appreciate such a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 wingspan of almost two meters 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.010
 the lower length is a tenant if 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.809
 you have gone a little too fast 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 i all elements of this strictly 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.460
 instructions in the infobox in detail 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 version linked 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 He starts with a stitch stop 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 and hit two stitches 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.770
 then it turned and knit both 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.730
 mesh right then it turned again 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.049
 to strictly make a stitch right one 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.340
 envelope and another stitch on the right 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.240
 then you turn it back to strictly 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.549
 a stitch on the right 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.549
 and straddle the envelope 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 and then a stitch on the right 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.720
 turn it over and that is actually 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 already had the series had to row 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.140
 one for the part 1 he knits one 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 mesh right makes an envelope and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.500
 knit the remaining stitches again 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.400
 right 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.760
 Turn it right to the right 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.300
 made envelope the envelope strict 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.680
 her right off and another 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.680
 last stitch on the right 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.080
 a stitch on the right an envelope and the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.880
 knit the remaining stitches to the right 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 next row is up to the envelope 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.710
 stretch and fold the envelope 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 Mark out 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.040
 and that goes on almost like that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
 Half of the wool consumed is ever 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.140
 after how to hedge later 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.750
 you want a little more left over 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.250
 He can decide for himself how long 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.920
 shall be 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.890
 You can also do this with Dreieckstuch 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.740
 200 meter make but then the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.350
 triangle scarf not very big at present you 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.480
 slowly arrived at half already 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.210
 now I show you how you the second 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.180
 You can stretch half of the branch 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.520
 listen to the pattern row where he has the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.090
 knit crossed from knitted 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.260
 so conscious delight because he knits two 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 mesh right together strictly until 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.830
 make the end of the series right and the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.600
 second row is totally complicated i 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.550
 I'm going to do something here 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.320
 cheat I have so much stitches up 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.240
 that not so many can talk 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.980
 in between that I row with a 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.620
 I'm done and already have one 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.340
 shorter series now this complicated 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.460
 second row 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.730
 In this series, everything was strictly legal 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.870
 mesh 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.100
 in the mermaid 1 knit two 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.710
 mesh right together 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.710
 and the remaining stitches only right 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.190
 and in the pattern row 2 you knit 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.380
 everything just real mesh and so far 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.480
 number three stitches on the needle 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.030
 if you only have three stitches on the needle 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.350
 Of course, you have to be strict again 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.590
 had row 1 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.450
 the last two right together and the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.560
 third right 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.620
 and chain the last two stitches 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.550
 and I have the whole thing still crochet with 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.190
 I'll go straight too 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.709
 video of it may be online 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.459
 comes that is tomorrow because I have to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.209
 rotate 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.760
 I was already in the video today 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.880
 finished and uploaded 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.090
 have a trip with my cloth 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.550
 and have taken the most beautiful photos 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.830
 I want to show you now 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.280
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.639
 and I wish you a knick-full 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.639
 Day
