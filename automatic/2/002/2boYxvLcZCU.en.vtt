kind<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:05.989> thing<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.410> mean<00:03:07.010> quite<00:03:07.370> good<00:03:07.610> well

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
kind of thing I mean quite good well

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.600 
kind of thing I mean quite good well
good<00:03:08.870> compensation<00:03:09.260> at<00:03:09.860> least<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.370> blitz

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
good compensation at least in a blitz

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.560 
good compensation at least in a blitz
game<00:03:11.410> well<00:03:12.410> his<00:03:12.680> king<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.190> wide<00:03:13.640> open<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.239> the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
game well his king is wide open and the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.940 
game well his king is wide open and the
light<00:03:14.810> squares<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.620> my<00:03:17.410> my<00:03:18.410> compensation

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
light squares are my my compensation

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.130 
light squares are my my compensation
here<00:03:19.430> Bishop<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.030> come<00:03:20.270> to<00:03:20.450> be<00:03:20.630> seven<00:03:20.959> maybe

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
here Bishop can come to be seven maybe

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.210 
here Bishop can come to be seven maybe
ever<00:03:22.130> oxy<00:03:22.580> eight<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.850> tempo<00:03:23.330> 95<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.470> kind<00:03:25.040> of

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
ever oxy eight with tempo 95 is kind of

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.850 
ever oxy eight with tempo 95 is kind of
backward<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.060> development<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.680> is

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
backward in development so this is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.370 
backward in development so this is
probably<00:03:28.459> enough<00:03:28.910> compensation<00:03:29.380> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
probably enough compensation the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.280 
probably enough compensation the
computer<00:03:30.920> here<00:03:31.130> gives<00:03:31.340> equal<00:03:31.630> yeah<00:03:32.630> maybe<00:03:32.959> I

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
computer here gives equal yeah maybe I

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.410 
computer here gives equal yeah maybe I
don't<00:03:33.650> know<00:03:33.709> it's<00:03:34.640> difficult<00:03:34.820> difficult

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
don't know it's difficult difficult

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.220 
don't know it's difficult difficult
really<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> sense<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:38.230> certainly

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
really to to a sense but certainly

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.540 
really to to a sense but certainly
possible<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.040> blitz<00:03:40.280> game<00:03:41.470> yeah<00:03:42.470> came<00:03:43.280> i

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
possible in a blitz game yeah came i

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.120 
possible in a blitz game yeah came i
also<00:03:44.360> had<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.989> one<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:45.890> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
also had this one this is what the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.070 
also had this one this is what the
engine<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.880> suggesting<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.570> have<00:03:47.690> very

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
engine is suggesting we have very

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.220 
engine is suggesting we have very
sensible<00:03:49.030> very<00:03:50.030> sense<00:03:50.330> of<00:03:50.510> what<00:03:50.720> i<00:03:50.750> was<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.050> I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
sensible very sense of what i was it I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.430 
sensible very sense of what i was it I
was<00:03:51.350> attracted<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.580> this

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
was attracted to this to this

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.670 
was attracted to this to this
to<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.490> sacrifice<00:03:54.760> them<00:03:55.480> by<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.200> way<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.440> can

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
to the sacrifice them by the way you can

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.730 
to the sacrifice them by the way you can
also<00:03:56.920> ignore<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.270> and<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.840> continue<00:03:59.470> like

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
also ignore this and just continue like

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.250 
also ignore this and just continue like
we<00:03:59.920> should<00:04:00.100> be<00:04:00.220> 3<00:04:00.490> or<00:04:00.520> something<00:04:01.060> let<00:04:02.020> me

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
we should be 3 or something let me

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.050 
we should be 3 or something let me
capture<00:04:02.470> them<00:04:04.740> this<00:04:05.740> kind<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.100> thing<00:04:06.190> but

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
capture them this kind of thing but

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.510 
capture them this kind of thing but
quite<00:04:07.420> often<00:04:07.690> Black<00:04:08.440> has<00:04:08.620> those<00:04:08.890> ideas<00:04:09.310> or

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
quite often Black has those ideas or

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.300 
quite often Black has those ideas or
queen<00:04:09.790> a5<00:04:10.210> is<00:04:10.240> also<00:04:10.780> moving<00:04:11.010> yeah<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.040> think

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
queen a5 is also moving yeah I think

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.229 
queen a5 is also moving yeah I think
this<00:04:12.430> should<00:04:12.760> be<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.940> good<00:04:13.060> counter<00:04:13.480> play

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
this should be a good counter play

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.640 
this should be a good counter play
currently<00:04:16.239> I'm<00:04:16.330> even<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.660> poner<00:04:16.959> which<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.410> not

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
currently I'm even a poner which is not

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.160 
currently I'm even a poner which is not
that<00:04:17.980> relevant<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:18.670> at<00:04:18.970> least<00:04:19.840> something

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
that relevant but at least something

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.760 
that relevant but at least something
white<00:04:21.100> probably<00:04:21.519> has<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.850> spend<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.300> move<00:04:22.510> at

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
white probably has to spend a move at

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.640 
white probably has to spend a move at
one<00:04:23.770> moment<00:04:23.980> to<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.610> recapture<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.240> pawn<00:04:25.650> yeah

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
one moment to to recapture the pawn yeah

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.650 
one moment to to recapture the pawn yeah
I<00:04:26.680> think<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.070> was<00:04:27.190> okay<00:04:27.610> in<00:04:27.880> general<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.630> think

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
I think that was okay in general I think

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.580 
I think that was okay in general I think
that<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:30.580> early<00:04:30.910> nights<00:04:31.330> if<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.780> cannot<00:04:32.320> be

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that this early nights if I cannot be

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.950 
that this early nights if I cannot be
that<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.910> much<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.390> challenge<00:04:34.630> for

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
that that that much of a challenge for

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.310 
that that that much of a challenge for
black<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:36.820> often<00:04:37.180> more<00:04:37.360> interesting<00:04:38.110> for

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
black it's often more interesting for

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.980 
black it's often more interesting for
white<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.860> play<00:04:39.850> something<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.630> four<00:04:40.960> a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
white to play something like a four a

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.130 
white to play something like a four a
five<00:04:41.610> trying<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.790> use<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.300> unprotected

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
five trying to use this unprotected

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.460 
five trying to use this unprotected
bishop<00:04:44.590> somehow<00:04:45.570> 193<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.750> also<00:04:47.200> an

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
bishop somehow 193 is also an

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.520 
bishop somehow 193 is also an
interesting<00:04:48.280> way<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:49.780> ignoring<00:04:50.230> that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
interesting way to go just ignoring that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.710 
interesting way to go just ignoring that
this<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:50.890> hanging<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.850> for<00:04:52.120> might<00:04:52.510> be

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
this is hanging because you for might be

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.010 
this is hanging because you for might be
good<00:04:52.870> compensation<00:04:53.260> or<00:04:53.770> 95<00:04:54.340> here<00:04:54.640> those<00:04:55.630> ideas

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
good compensation or 95 here those ideas

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.810 
good compensation or 95 here those ideas
are<00:04:56.170> interesting<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:57.190> he<00:04:57.400> didn't<00:04:57.700> go<00:04:57.790> for

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
are interesting that he didn't go for

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.040 
are interesting that he didn't go for
that<00:04:58.030> okay<00:04:58.960> well<00:04:59.169> thanks<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.740> watching
