controlling the ball with the inside of
the<00:00:35.650> foot<00:00:35.830> so<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.550> method<00:00:36.970> in<00:00:37.060> curriculum<00:00:37.510> we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
the foot so the method in curriculum we

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.170 
the foot so the method in curriculum we
use<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.250> force<00:00:39.520> them<00:00:39.700> to<00:00:39.760> use<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
use is going to force them to use the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.420 
use is going to force them to use the
bottom<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.660> foot<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.680> outside<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.370> the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
bottom of the foot the outside of the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240 
bottom of the foot the outside of the
foot<00:00:42.640> which<00:00:43.210> is<00:00:43.360> how<00:00:43.560> you<00:00:44.560> can<00:00:44.740> really<00:00:45.010> gain

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
foot which is how you can really gain

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.870 
foot which is how you can really gain
maximum<00:00:45.520> control

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.300 

it's<00:00:51.450> interesting<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.320> each<00:00:53.010> kid

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
it's interesting because as each kid

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's interesting because as each kid
have<00:00:53.670> watched<00:00:54.000> them<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:55.020> progress<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
have watched them and they progress the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.150 
have watched them and they progress the
interesting<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.880> is<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.540> as<00:00:57.890> as<00:00:58.890> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
interesting thing is is that as as they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.619 
interesting thing is is that as as they
start<00:00:59.430> working<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.879> skills<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.600> they

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
start working on skills because they

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
start working on skills because they
don't<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.110> get<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.830> technical<00:01:02.460> at

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
don't really get that the technical at

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.420 
don't really get that the technical at
practices<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.710> focused<00:01:05.339> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
practices it's all a lot focused on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
practices it's all a lot focused on
tactical<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
tactical so out here it's more of the

tactical so out here it's more of the
technical<00:01:07.140> components<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.220> you'll<00:01:08.400> see

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
technical components because you'll see

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the skills and the repetition that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920 
the skills and the repetition that
happens<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.490> weeks<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.150> months<00:01:12.180> and

happens over weeks and then months and
then<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> interesting<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
then the interesting thing is is that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
then the interesting thing is is that
the<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.810> muscle<00:01:16.200> memory<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the the muscle memory and the time that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
the the muscle memory and the time that
they<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.580> automatically<00:01:18.360> applies<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.640> to
