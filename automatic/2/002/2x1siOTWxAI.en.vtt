and<00:01:29.820> he<00:01:30.330> needs<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.659> banelings<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.289> think<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and he needs some banelings I think that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
and he needs some banelings I think that
would<00:01:31.830> be<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.250> move<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.380> get<00:01:34.380> like

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would be a good move right now get like

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.719 
would be a good move right now get like
10<00:01:34.890> banelings<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.819> watch<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.539> destruction

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
10 banelings and watch the destruction

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
10 banelings and watch the destruction
but<00:01:38.729> no<00:01:38.880> where<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.179> he<00:01:39.390> roaches<00:01:40.080> with<00:01:40.319> one

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
army built to kill roaches so he needs

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.149 
army built to kill roaches so he needs
to<00:01:55.280> switch<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.459> hydras<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.539> they<00:01:57.720> are

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
to switch to hydras and there they are

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.160 
to switch to hydras and there they are
hydras<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.539> pretty<00:02:00.539> darn<00:02:00.780> effective

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
what's so tough about zerg though is the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.920 
what's so tough about zerg though is the

start picking off all these centuries I
was<00:06:49.400> just<00:06:49.520> huge<00:06:50.030> damage<00:06:50.360> dealt<00:06:51.169> to<00:06:51.470> the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
was just huge damage dealt to the

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.540 
was just huge damage dealt to the
Protoss<00:06:52.190> player

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.750 

army<00:06:54.880> oh<00:06:55.440> he<00:06:56.440> gives<00:06:57.100> a<00:06:57.280> GG<00:06:57.670> I<00:06:58.770> think<00:06:59.770> he<00:06:59.890> really

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
army oh he gives a GG I think he really

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.070 
army oh he gives a GG I think he really
could<00:07:00.940> have<00:07:00.970> won<00:07:01.900> that<00:07:01.930> game<00:07:02.320> still<00:07:02.920> I<00:07:04.080> think

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
could have won that game still I think

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.990 
could have won that game still I think
the<00:07:05.170> Zerg<00:07:06.720> probably<00:07:07.720> had<00:07:08.050> more<00:07:08.260> creepier

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
the Zerg probably had more creepier

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.730 
the Zerg probably had more creepier
creep<00:07:10.000> highway<00:07:10.420> and<00:07:10.630> use<00:07:11.200> their<00:07:11.410> speed<00:07:11.710> and

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
creep highway and use their speed and

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.140 
creep highway and use their speed and
everything<00:07:12.130> affects<00:07:12.340> the<00:07:12.610> Protoss<00:07:12.970> is

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
everything affects the Protoss is

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.230 
everything affects the Protoss is
nothing<00:07:13.810> he's<00:07:14.710> got<00:07:15.070> this<00:07:15.250> expansion<00:07:15.670> going<00:07:16.090> up

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
nothing he's got this expansion going up

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.330 
nothing he's got this expansion going up
but<00:07:16.450> he's<00:07:16.600> completely<00:07:17.080> mined<00:07:17.440> out<00:07:17.650> I<00:07:17.890> won't

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
but he's completely mined out I won't

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.770 
but he's completely mined out I won't
see<00:07:18.460> his<00:07:18.580> income<00:07:18.910> aw<00:07:19.090> didn't<00:07:19.360> use<00:07:19.450> this<00:07:19.570> menu

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
see his income aw didn't use this menu

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.950 
see his income aw didn't use this menu
at<00:07:19.990> all<00:07:20.110> this<00:07:20.260> whole<00:07:20.440> game<00:07:20.760> alright<00:07:21.760> 720<00:07:22.690> but

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
at all this whole game alright 720 but

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.930 
at all this whole game alright 720 but
that's<00:07:23.140> basically<00:07:23.530> off<00:07:23.950> of<00:07:23.980> just<00:07:24.520> the<00:07:24.700> space

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
that's basically off of just the space

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.660 
that's basically off of just the space
and<00:07:25.690> that's<00:07:26.530> not<00:07:26.680> even<00:07:26.770> saturated<00:07:27.430> it's<00:07:27.550> not

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
and that's not even saturated it's not

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.510 
and that's not even saturated it's not
even<00:07:27.850> close<00:07:28.090> to<00:07:28.150> saturated<00:07:28.810> I<00:07:29.370> really<00:07:30.370> think

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
even close to saturated I really think

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.380 
even close to saturated I really think
the<00:07:30.760> other<00:07:30.940> could<00:07:32.520> stuck<00:07:33.520> this<00:07:33.730> game<00:07:33.940> out<00:07:33.970> and

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390 
the other could stuck this game out and

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.630 
the other could stuck this game out and
won<00:07:34.570> it<00:07:34.750> definitely<00:07:36.120> had<00:07:37.120> an<00:07:37.270> income<00:07:37.720> I<00:07:38.640> mean

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640 
won it definitely had an income I mean

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.670 
won it definitely had an income I mean
yeah<00:07:40.600> he's<00:07:40.780> got<00:07:40.930> a<00:07:40.960> pretty<00:07:41.050> good<00:07:41.200> army<00:07:41.530> right

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 
yeah he's got a pretty good army right

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.780 
yeah he's got a pretty good army right
now<00:07:41.830> and<00:07:41.920> he<00:07:42.010> probably<00:07:42.280> taking<00:07:42.730> this

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.790 
now and he probably taking this

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.730 
now and he probably taking this
expansion<00:07:43.270> out<00:07:43.510> but<00:07:43.810> I<00:07:43.990> still<00:07:44.230> think<00:07:44.470> it<00:07:44.590> would

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
expansion out but I still think it would

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.430 
expansion out but I still think it would
have<00:07:44.830> been<00:07:44.890> possible<00:07:45.240> but<00:07:46.240> can't<00:07:47.110> see<00:07:47.320> what

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 
have been possible but can't see what

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.130 
have been possible but can't see what
you<00:07:47.500> want<00:07:47.680> um<00:07:48.370> that's<00:07:49.060> going<00:07:49.330> to<00:07:49.390> be<00:07:49.450> all<00:07:49.990> the
