00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.280 
about the new prices of the base plates
and<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.950> color<00:05:47.220> change<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:47.970> that's<00:05:48.290> even

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
and the color change to that's even

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.920 
and the color change to that's even
almost<00:05:49.440> more<00:05:49.830> disappointing<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.580> me<00:05:50.610> because

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
almost more disappointing to me because

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.910 
almost more disappointing to me because
that<00:05:51.930> tells<00:05:52.140> me<00:05:52.260> when<00:05:52.500> they<00:05:52.590> come<00:05:52.800> out<00:05:52.860> with

that tells me when they come out with

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.700 
that tells me when they come out with
the<00:05:53.130> new<00:05:53.250> blue<00:05:54.140> eventually<00:05:55.140> when<00:05:55.320> they<00:05:55.410> do<00:05:55.470> it

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
the new blue eventually when they do it

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.560 
the new blue eventually when they do it
maybe<00:05:55.920> it'll<00:05:56.160> be<00:05:56.250> like<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.490> friends<00:05:57.000> blew<00:05:57.300> it

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570
