00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 new tutorial from me 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.580
 today it's about a trail around a very 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 great half on an area and to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.950
 can you now once the hair one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 environmentally aware and goes with that 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.320
 thumb on the ears wobble arrange land 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.320
 The hair has two parts 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.370
 you have it hidden on the bottom 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.239
 that I really have all the hair together 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 have that nice out of the way then 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.870
 I could be around the upper hair 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.580
 and could all come to one side so can 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.040
 her too often on the other side 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.890
 start as you really feel better 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.560
 and braid and then I start 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 at the side on the bad take 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.610
 three strands of hair 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.740
 and bad ones then like one 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.570
 French braid 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 if always from below of the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.460
 loose open hair still hair 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.990
 And it is really great in the hairstyle 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.320
 she lives off her when she is a bit 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.730
 messy in the little bit yes so messi 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.720
 hairstyle really at home it looks is 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.790
 absolutely beautiful 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 You also need a lot of attention 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.840
 that every strand is the same size or 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.080
 The surface is just as thick 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.030
 as it just gets hold of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.979
 maybe in the ideal case maybe 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.660
 is a strand a bit thicker 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.740
 or the other bit thinner that it 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.150
 no problem yet 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.710
 Potsdam always taking from the bottom one at that 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.729
 so at the moment really nice on the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.729
 scalp rests 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.920
 if you like me like that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.920
 lock of hair have forgotten 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.770
 and then there will be more character 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.720
 to have 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 So I always think it's great when 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.160
 then not everything is so accurate I stand 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 not so accurate things anyway 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.250
 as when cooking or at the hairstyles 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.940
 I think it's great if it's a bit 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.940
 looks individual and when I experienced 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 because maybe then I just 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.910
 under the french software about 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:08.260
 the head to get all hairs have the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.950
 upper hair piece and then all hair 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.520
 interwoven and maybe me 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.520
 just continue down to normal 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.780
 normal braid pulled up my braid 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.780
 completely through 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.500
 and fix the part to the best one 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.260
 very small thin hair elastic but if 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.910
 you like me just a thin something 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.380
 you must have a bigger one 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.210
 wrapping more often is better for the pest 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.410
 But do not be afraid with the haag around now 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.910
 why not happen 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.450
 We open the back part of the hair 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.360
 and take the braid back to the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.420
 scalp to the lively hairline and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.040
 then we put the pressure best 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.060
 over the hair elastic with dull 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.060
 hair clips stuck 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.950
 then you get more hold if you like that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.570
 I like a little thin hair 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.760
 they had a little bit brave 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.220
 then just cling a few more 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.030
 take and cross each other over 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.090
 stick 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.040
 then that will hold really good 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.360
 it has to be already stuck back there 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.680
 so that you do not get out of the braid there 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.240
 flutscht 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.660
 if that is then, I think so 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.110
 synonymous so 34 hair clips needed 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.520
 then you catch emergency hair for me 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.560
 a thin strand of the top then still 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.970
 a strand from below toupet the lightly 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.970
 through and the bottom hair as well 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.379
 then I go with that just came 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.509
 gently over the surface 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.909
 So that's not how it works 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.409
 i type of krause does not look so easy 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.599
 Smooth in the surface but not 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.330
 really know the volume because of the volume 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.689
 hinterkopf torrent files and so looks 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.909
 it off when he finishes is totally great 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.979
 I think that's a bit messy 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:16.069
 but nice 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.199
 yes is a great spring hairstyle yes 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.740
 Have fun imitating and I'm happy 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.740
