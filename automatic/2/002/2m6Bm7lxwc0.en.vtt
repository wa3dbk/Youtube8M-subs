on revolution network maybe a month ago
I'm<00:00:28.660> going<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:28.810> start<00:00:28.990> off<00:00:29.080> by<00:00:29.140> just<00:00:29.320> kind<00:00:29.770> of

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
I'm going to start off by just kind of

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.850 
I'm going to start off by just kind of
going<00:00:29.950> over<00:00:30.250> some<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:31.710> frequencies<00:00:32.710> on

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
going over some of the frequencies on

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.350 
going over some of the frequencies on
the<00:00:32.949> coffee<00:00:33.129> hug<00:00:33.400> that<00:00:33.610> kind<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.820> stand<00:00:34.059> out<00:00:34.180> to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
the coffee hug that kind of stand out to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.670 
the coffee hug that kind of stand out to
me<00:00:34.390> where<00:00:34.540> this<00:00:34.629> guy<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:34.840> being<00:00:35.470> really

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
me where this guy is being really

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.009 
me where this guy is being really
exploitable<00:00:36.160> which<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.820> for<00:00:37.330> this<00:00:37.449> guy<00:00:37.600> pretty

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
exploitable which is for this guy pretty

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.070 
exploitable which is for this guy pretty
much<00:00:38.199> everywhere<00:00:39.390> isn't<00:00:40.390> raised<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.809> button

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
much everywhere isn't raised a button

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.020 
much everywhere isn't raised a button
yet<00:00:41.230> over<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.930> know<00:00:44.050> 21<00:00:44.920> hands<00:00:45.370> at<00:00:45.550> 12<00:00:45.879> big

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
yet over you know 21 hands at 12 big

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
yet over you know 21 hands at 12 big
blinds<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.510> higher<00:00:48.360> limping<00:00:49.360> mostly<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
blinds and higher limping mostly and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.610 
blinds and higher limping mostly and
actually<00:00:50.379> folding<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.980> decent<00:00:51.340> amount<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.790> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
actually folding a decent amount to and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.720 
actually folding a decent amount to and
as<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.739> can<00:00:53.829> see<00:00:53.890> slim<00:00:54.190> trapping<00:00:54.579> some

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
as you can see slim trapping some

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.190 
as you can see slim trapping some
obviously<00:00:55.329> which<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.660> expected<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.390> not

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
obviously which is expected and not

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.529 
obviously which is expected and not
playing<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.520> know<00:01:00.610> incredibly<00:01:01.059> wide<00:01:01.270> out<00:01:01.420> of

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
playing you know incredibly wide out of

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.930 
playing you know incredibly wide out of
position<00:01:01.629> we<00:01:02.110> can<00:01:02.140> probably<00:01:02.620> assume<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.850> know

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
position we can probably assume you know

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.170 
position we can probably assume you know
eight<00:01:04.180> hands<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.809> deeper<00:01:05.199> stack<00:01:05.820> he's<00:01:06.820> folded

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
eight hands a deeper stack he's folded

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.490 
eight hands a deeper stack he's folded
half<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.509> them<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:07.810> he's<00:01:07.960> probably<00:01:08.050> not<00:01:08.320> too

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
half of them so he's probably not too

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.100 
half of them so he's probably not too
out<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.619> line<00:01:08.710> no<00:01:09.610> three<00:01:09.880> bets<00:01:10.060> yet<00:01:10.240> so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
out of line no three bets yet so

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.320 
out of line no three bets yet so
basically<00:01:12.070> my<00:01:12.450> adjustment<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:13.539> position<00:01:15.330> for

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
basically my adjustment in position for

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.240 
basically my adjustment in position for
myself<00:01:16.660> in<00:01:16.840> position<00:01:16.960> she's<00:01:17.830> going<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.979> be<00:01:18.070> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
myself in position she's going to be to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.340 
myself in position she's going to be to
be<00:01:18.280> raising<00:01:18.759> bunch<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.479> buttons<00:01:19.630> definitely

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
be raising bunch of buttons definitely

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.990 
be raising bunch of buttons definitely
not<00:01:20.649> folding<00:01:21.160> any<00:01:21.340> buttons<00:01:22.470> I'll<00:01:23.470> be<00:01:24.000> opening

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
not folding any buttons I'll be opening

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.380 
not folding any buttons I'll be opening
probably<00:01:25.599> 85<00:01:26.500> 90<00:01:27.039> percent<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
probably 85 90 percent and then the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.330 
probably 85 90 percent and then the
bottom<00:01:28.750> ten<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.200> fifteen<00:01:29.470> percent<00:01:29.709> of<00:01:29.830> hands<00:01:30.160> I

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
bottom ten to fifteen percent of hands I

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.969 
bottom ten to fifteen percent of hands I
definitely<00:01:31.149> think<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:32.530> going<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.709> have<00:01:32.860> that

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
definitely think are going to have that

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.490 
definitely think are going to have that
better<00:01:33.280> expectation<00:01:34.119> either<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:34.959> a<00:01:34.990> raise<00:01:35.259> or

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
better expectation either as a raise or

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.490 
better expectation either as a raise or
a<00:01:35.530> limp<00:01:35.830> than<00:01:36.670> folding<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.470> preferred<00:01:38.470> to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
a limp than folding I preferred to

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.499 
a limp than folding I preferred to
probably<00:01:38.830> limp<00:01:39.130> until<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.729> have<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.330> bigger

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
probably limp until I have a bigger

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.219 
probably limp until I have a bigger
sample<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.670> know<00:01:42.789> see<00:01:42.940> was<00:01:43.149> doing<00:01:43.360> he

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
sample and you know see was doing he

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.479 
sample and you know see was doing he
really<00:01:44.470> hasn't<00:01:44.619> folded<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.069> lot<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.340> seat

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:45.489 
really hasn't folded to a lot of seat

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.020 
really hasn't folded to a lot of seat
bets<00:01:45.670> yet<00:01:45.849> like<00:01:46.209> if<00:01:46.660> he<00:01:47.649> had<00:01:47.860> folded<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.580> Morsi

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
bets yet like if he had folded to Morsi

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.430 
bets yet like if he had folded to Morsi
bets<00:01:49.239> you<00:01:49.479> know<00:01:49.599> I<00:01:49.630> might<00:01:49.869> be<00:01:50.080> considering

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
bets you know I might be considering

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.499 
bets you know I might be considering
just<00:01:50.649> raising<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.069> hundred<00:01:51.369> percent<00:01:51.509> since

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
just raising a hundred percent since

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.410 
just raising a hundred percent since
he's<00:01:52.660> not<00:01:52.780> three<00:01:53.050> betting<00:01:53.319> me<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.670> pretty<00:01:55.030> it

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
he's not three betting me but pretty it

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.240 
he's not three betting me but pretty it
was<00:01:55.539> that's<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.380> six<00:01:56.649> seventeen

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
was that's a one of six seventeen

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.630 
was that's a one of six seventeen
percent<00:01:57.429> so<00:01:58.000> not<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.750> huge<00:01:58.959> sample<00:01:59.200> but<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.979> think

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
percent so not a huge sample but I think

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.919 
percent so not a huge sample but I think
as<00:02:00.729> long<00:02:00.880> as<00:02:01.060> you're<00:02:01.149> not<00:02:01.179> folding<00:02:01.569> a<00:02:01.630> button

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
as long as you're not folding a button

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.449 
as long as you're not folding a button
versus<00:02:02.319> somebody<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.770> has<00:02:02.890> stats<00:02:03.099> like<00:02:03.280> this

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
versus somebody that has stats like this

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.910 
versus somebody that has stats like this
you're<00:02:03.610> doing<00:02:03.789> pretty<00:02:03.880> good<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.649> position

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
you're doing pretty good out of position

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.990 
you're doing pretty good out of position
I<00:02:07.679> mean<00:02:08.679> obviously<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.099> not<00:02:09.190> raising<00:02:09.640> buttons

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
I mean obviously is not raising buttons

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.580 
I mean obviously is not raising buttons
who's<00:02:10.179> not<00:02:10.330> giving<00:02:10.690> me<00:02:10.750> an<00:02:10.810> opportunity<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.319> do

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
who's not giving me an opportunity to do

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.199 
who's not giving me an opportunity to do
a<00:02:11.620> whole<00:02:11.860> lot<00:02:11.920> preflop<00:02:12.520> but<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.790> think<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.060> one

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
a whole lot preflop but I think the one

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.360 
a whole lot preflop but I think the one
thing<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:13.450> probably<00:02:14.230> stands<00:02:14.770> out<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.190> me<00:02:15.220> is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
thing that probably stands out to me is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.850 
thing that probably stands out to me is
like<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.989> guys<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.410> coach<00:02:17.590> will

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
like a lot of the guys that I coach will

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860 
like a lot of the guys that I coach will
say<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.340> they<00:02:18.489> want<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> attack<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.660> limp

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
say like they want to attack the limp

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.020 
say like they want to attack the limp
and<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.319> allow<00:02:20.590> your<00:02:21.190> opponent<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.670> limp<00:02:21.849> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and not allow your opponent to limp and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.970 
and not allow your opponent to limp and
stuff<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.480> think<00:02:22.709> tends<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.950> a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
stuff which I think tends to be a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.560 
stuff which I think tends to be a
misconception<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.620> any<00:02:27.430> time<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
misconception you know any time for the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.820 
misconception you know any time for the
most<00:02:28.720> part<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.260> know

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
most part you know

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.470 
most part you know
most<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.640> our<00:02:30.700> opponents<00:02:31.120> when<00:02:31.210> they<00:02:31.270> limp

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
most of our opponents when they limp

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.730 
most of our opponents when they limp
against<00:02:31.810> us<00:02:31.930> they're<00:02:32.110> kind<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.320> doing<00:02:32.530> us<00:02:32.620> a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
against us they're kind of doing us a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.500 
against us they're kind of doing us a
favor<00:02:32.980> they're<00:02:33.340> allowing<00:02:33.610> us<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.910> realize

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
favor they're allowing us to realize

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.840 
favor they're allowing us to realize
expectation<00:02:35.320> with<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.770> bunch<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.490> hands<00:02:36.820> that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
expectation with a bunch of hands that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.310 
expectation with a bunch of hands that
we<00:02:37.090> would<00:02:37.210> just<00:02:37.330> fold<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.690> preflop<00:02:38.080> raise

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
we would just fold do a preflop raise

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.760 
we would just fold do a preflop raise
usually<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.510> mean<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.080> our<00:02:41.260> opponent<00:02:41.710> is

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
usually that I mean if our opponent is

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.860 
usually that I mean if our opponent is
limping<00:02:42.100> most<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.520> his<00:02:42.640> bit<00:02:42.880> most<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.780> this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
limping most of his bit most of this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.380 
limping most of his bit most of this
buttons<00:02:44.260> are<00:02:44.470> limping<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.860> lot<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.390> we're

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
buttons are limping a lot and we're

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.790 
buttons are limping a lot and we're
raising<00:02:46.570> most<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.260> buttons<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.740> be

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
raising most of our buttons can be

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.320 
raising most of our buttons can be
pretty<00:02:48.100> hard<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.430> him<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.850> doing<00:02:49.090> very

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
pretty hard for him to be doing very

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.870 
pretty hard for him to be doing very
well<00:02:49.510> versus<00:02:49.900> us<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:51.460> think<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.700> want

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
well versus us so I don't think you want

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.150 
well versus us so I don't think you want
to<00:02:51.940> just<00:02:52.090> necessarily<00:02:52.570> punish<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> limp<00:02:53.890> but

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
to just necessarily punish the limp but

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.240 
to just necessarily punish the limp but
just<00:02:54.370> make<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.730> highest<00:02:55.060> expectation<00:02:55.780> play

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
just make the highest expectation play

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.790 
just make the highest expectation play
in<00:02:57.250> each<00:02:57.400> spot<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.540> otherwise<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.500> only<00:02:59.680> other

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
in each spot so otherwise the only other

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.990 
in each spot so otherwise the only other
stat<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.100> kind<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.460> stands<00:03:00.670> out<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.940> me

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
stat that kind of stands out to me

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.020 
stat that kind of stands out to me
initially<00:03:01.240> is<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.160> as<00:03:03.160> limp<00:03:03.490> see<00:03:03.700> bet<00:03:03.880> he

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
initially is the as limp see bet he

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.930 
initially is the as limp see bet he
hasn't<00:03:04.180> stabbed<00:03:04.600> out<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.620> five<00:03:05.800> times<00:03:06.130> one

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
hasn't stabbed out of five times one

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.330 
hasn't stabbed out of five times one
check<00:03:07.180> two<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> limp<00:03:07.690> pot<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:08.950> going<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
check two and a limp pot so I'm going to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.270 
check two and a limp pot so I'm going to
be<00:03:09.430> leading<00:03:09.700> out<00:03:10.260> limped<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:12.130> than<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
be leading out limped more than I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.100 
be leading out limped more than I
normally<00:03:12.459> would<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.880> would<00:03:13.090> normally<00:03:13.209> be

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
normally would I would normally be

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.110 
normally would I would normally be
checking<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:17.110> most<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.500> my<00:03:17.560> range<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.910> lot

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
checking with most of my range on a lot

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.400 
checking with most of my range on a lot
of<00:03:19.240> boards<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.780> pretty<00:03:23.020> good<00:03:23.200> spot

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
of boards but this is a pretty good spot

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.340 
of boards but this is a pretty good spot
normally<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.080> board

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
normally like this is this is a board

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.140 
normally like this is this is a board
where<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.500> would<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.740> leading<00:03:26.920> typically<00:03:27.490> as<00:03:28.120> a

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
where I would be leading typically as a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.530 
where I would be leading typically as a
standard<00:03:28.660> versus<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.440> weak<00:03:30.100> player<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.610> just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
standard versus a weak player I just

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020 
standard versus a weak player I just
think<00:03:31.690> it's<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> spot<00:03:32.110> where<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:33.310> lead<00:03:33.580> you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
think it's a spot where you lead you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670 
think it's a spot where you lead you
know<00:03:34.150> half<00:03:34.390> pot<00:03:34.660> on<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> flop<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.500> think

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
know half pot on the flop and I think

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.050 
know half pot on the flop and I think
they've<00:03:35.830> most<00:03:36.340> people<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:36.640> going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.850> fold

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
they've most people are going to fold

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.030 
they've most people are going to fold
anything<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.630> has<00:03:37.780> no<00:03:38.200> equity<00:03:38.620> which<00:03:38.830> is

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
anything that has no equity which is

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.949 
anything that has no equity which is
there's<00:03:40.030> definitely<00:03:40.390> enough<00:03:40.570> hands

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
there's definitely enough hands

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.190 
there's definitely enough hands
considering<00:03:41.890> how<00:03:41.980> much<00:03:42.130> we're<00:03:42.310> risking<00:03:42.459> so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
considering how much we're risking so

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
considering how much we're risking so
small<00:03:44.200> bet<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.440> don't<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.890> need<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.040> bet

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
small bet I don't think you need to bet

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.600 
small bet I don't think you need to bet
any<00:03:45.340> bigger<00:03:45.580> than<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.920> obviously<00:03:47.920> good

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
any bigger than that and obviously good

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.280 
any bigger than that and obviously good
turn<00:03:48.790> card<00:03:49.060> for<00:03:49.330> us<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.930> think<00:03:49.989> there's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
turn card for us and I think there's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.690 
turn card for us and I think there's
some<00:03:50.440> definitely<00:03:50.860> some<00:03:51.010> value<00:03:51.310> here<00:03:53.700> pretty

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
some definitely some value here pretty

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.309 
some definitely some value here pretty
standard

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319
