00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.240
 kids to this new video tutorial my 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.640
 name is Jorge and good this time 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.210
 we would be seeing how to install 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.390
 or how to give a good effect to your 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.450
 folders in windows 7 and well then this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.490
 it's a customization tutorial and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.560
 right now I will be giving you the preview 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 how will this look 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.480
 how will the animation be in the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.320
 folders and well let's go into a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 folder that here in libraries will come and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.360
 they decided us to the effect that comes 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.360
 going down the new stairway 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.260
 and good here I bring you this tutorial 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.520
 There are 5 folder animations and good 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.950
 then the download link will be in 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:01.060
 mediafire already downloaded the file 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.140
 and it does not weigh much and it is installable does not pass 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.140
 nothing and good 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.400
 today we are going to look for the point file that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.980
 we have downloaded 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.790
 we have it here that says is explorer 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.790
 frame animation and studies because we bring 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.770
 and we get this folder that is waiting for the 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:32.039
 frame animation seen 2 we enter and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.979
 here you do not know what the good setup is 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.630
 what is this benefits you a lot because you do not 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.619
 you have to change the explorer in prime 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.539
 as he says to me and good because this 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.759
 bring an installer so you do not 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.939
 you can install other things you do not move anymore 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.299
 nothing just install the installer and it would be 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.789
 all that, so it 's very good I know 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.399
 I recommend download it and well then 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.620
 let's click right click right 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.180
 on Sherwood we will 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.180
 will give us something like that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:14.180
 and well let's go to give enter and 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:18.530
 here we get 555 this for more of this 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.280
 of animation and here for example I'm going to 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.550
 give the 2 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.890
 we put the number you want and then 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.770
 we choose 1 2 3 and 4 only one I choose 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.730
 the 2 and I give enter you can choose 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.040
 any animation that is 1 2 3 and 4 and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.069
 put him there 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.930
 and we give enter and it will not restart 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.909
 the taskbar 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.670
 and now we are going to enter the 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.299
 folders let's see how we have been 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.299
 The effect 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.520
 concentrated libraries and you can not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.060
 appreciate what 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.690
 like coming out and going down stairs 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.330
 well the truth is it had a good effect 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.410
 equally if they want to change that they have 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.220
 to renew tutti all that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.220
 and enter 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.070
 and good and now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.620
 to see how to install this I'm going to 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.200
 teach how to install if you 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.680
 they do not want to have it and well, this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.310
 it's super easy, they're going to press a 5 on 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.850
 number 5 here for you to desist him that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.380
 it says of salt animation what to uninstall with 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.230
 the number 5 and by clicking enter enter them 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.940
 will remove the animation and good friends then 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.370
 this has been everything we see each other until a 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.370
 next tutorial until next ciao
