00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.660
 Y 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.299
 hello friends welcome to the academy of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.209
 Mr. 5 today in the physics of my 35 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.880
 let's talk about something more advanced than 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:20.300
 is the lift of an airplane the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.090
 support of an airplane you had seen 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.439
 a plane we are going to see now you have 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.440
 seen that an airplane was sustained because 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.410
 because he had a profile 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.810
 that was asymmetric about the xy axis 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.510
 that allowed me when the current 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.340
 came to the plane because of the particles that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.530
 they went up they will accelerate and those that 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.120
 they go down they generate that provoked 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.880
 by bernoulli principle since 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.590
 there would be more pressure than up in the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.410
 intrados that is the bottom part 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.260
 there would be more pressure than in extra 2 and 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.180
 that ended up resulting in a force 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.130
 vertical and up we're going to go to the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 lift 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.150
 what I did not tell you then is that there 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.040
 other effects that contribute to the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.830
 airplane sustain and this is one but there 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.250
 others will see if to this we add that 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:10.530
 when I put that profile inclined or 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 the wing if you believe inclined I do so 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.040
 what I have done now I can imagine 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.600
 that what inclined alpha degrees then to 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.840
 this we call it by certain angle of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.670
 Aragon 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.829
 in aerodynamics this is the angle of 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.579
 attack then if I give it an angle of 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.520
 attack to the guadal profile this is going to 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.619
 generate more lift still and if 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.440
 besides that I give a thickness to 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.620
 profile 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.380
 I'll tell you something 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.440
 dynamic but good if I have a 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.630
 flat plate and the orientation oriented alpha 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.090
 degrees in front of the imaginative current 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.370
 that the current is coming here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 then the support of this plate 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.380
 is 2 and alpha 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.830
 then if I this plate now I give it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.690
 thickness because that plate will support 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.330
 even more is to say here there is an effect 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.330
 would save us this there is an effect 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.130
 additional thickness that makes 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.820
 still support more therefore by the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.980
 Asymmetric geometry is by the angle 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 of attack and by the thickness these are the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520
 three main factors that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.740
 contribute to the sustainability of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 a sheet 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.700
 regarding the thickness I remind you this is 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.700
 important and if I had given 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.000
 a profile so imagine the plate that you 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.230
 I just told you but with thickness but 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 no angle of attack ie funds 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.330
 this sustains us because because 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.760
 although I change the speeds here of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.890
 here as astrometry being up and 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 down the same in inter managed the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.829
 pressures are equal up and down and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.290
 therefore, it generates support for us 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.680
 what eye with put thickness the thickness by 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.959
 yes only does not imply support we have 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.180
 to accompany other elements such as 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.269
 can be the angle of attack or the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.590
 profile astrometry profile well ya 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.230
 we know something more about the support to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.750
 let's see analytically or 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.709
 mathematical if you want here is the same 71 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.319
 Well, it's going to be equal to a rock medium 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.260
 it's usually square rain let's 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.400
 analyze 11 rock is the density of the air 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.190
 obviously you know that the density 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.500
 air are very gaining height goes down 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.079
 but on cruise to about 30 thousand feet or thousand 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.299
 meters high this is pretty much 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.470
 constant is soon a constant 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.660
 on cruise 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.710
 when we are not cruise do not know 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.660
 the surface that is the surface is 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.550
 say if I have the plane seen from 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 above 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.570
 it was a bit in such a way that it 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.730
 would correspond with all this surface 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.830
 the surface of the wing and it looks pretty 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.470
 coherent that the more surface the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.260
 therefore have more global support 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.319
 the plane gives 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.540
 it is usually a constant with a 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.000
 geometric variable crispe tends to be 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.970
 I can overtake we have another video if 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.459
 you want is a function of alpha how much 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.989
 bigger is the alpha attack angle 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.480
 older c about l 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.730
 we are not going to spend much more time here 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.950
 because if we have been in videos of 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 basic radiant level but that you know 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.870
 which is usually a geometric function 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.489
 of the angle of attack and that for each wing 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.190
 will have a different form this is something 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.740
 so according to alpha increase x is usually going 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.710
 increasing here what happens this is a 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.990
 Stop the maximum because as soon as I pass it 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.699
 went into loss we will make another video for 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.990
 talk about that that an airplane enters 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.789
 in loss but you will have heard many 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.740
 Sometimes you will see when it enters 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.449
 loss is that I have increased both the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.880
 angle of attack that I have already reached 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.180
 angles in which he no longer supported the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.130
 otherwise it caused a breaking effect 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.960
 sustentaciÃ³n we will see in another video 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.490
 Well, you usually know that 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.040
 it depends on alpha the higher in 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.050
 principle is usually more and therefore more 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.330
 and v is the velocity velocity of the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.580
 plane but look good 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.260
 bbva squared with which will be 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.680
 much more important than any of 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.590
 the others 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.930
 it's going to be much more important so 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.310
 so much in cruise the ra is constant 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.050
 pressure this inclusion is to tell us of 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.449
 a constant flight height is not going to 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.120
 be constant the surface is constant 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.610
 depends depends because if I have a 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.159
 to 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.530
 many times you will have seen that here 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.770
 they extend the things to the wing these are 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.139
 the flaps 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.759
 and they are used in the maneuvers of 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.259
 landing and takeoff-- are critical 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.240
 because the speed is very low 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.560
 note the thanks are very low and it goes 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.180
 squared which is very critical 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.069
 you have to compensate and how do I do it 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.349
 increasing the surface increasing 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.520
 you are therefore extending flaps that 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.129
 you will have seen it when you land 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.270
 you wait and what I do is that that 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:50.480
 effective surface you see the increase 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.500
 well they are the flans also very 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.570
 important with which the jce in 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.620
 principle will be constant except in 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.170
 landing and takeoff maneuvers 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.720
 when deploy deployment these 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.030
 surfaces then you have usually seen 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.070
 that depends on the angle is here in 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.840
 Cruise the plane at an angle of attack 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.560
 constant with which will be constant 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.920
 but in the maneuvers of ascent 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.320
 imagine the plane is ascending then 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.370
 in these maneuvers, fix that the angle 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.700
 of attack will increase notice that the 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.220
 plane tilts a lot and therefore the 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.260
 profile in front of the current that 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.630
 enter what you see are attack angles 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.510
 older therefore 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.210
 and it angle of attack is also going to 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.520
 vary and good speed because 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.130
 depends on it also depends a lot on 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.460
 how the driver manages the engines 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.480
 then the takeoff that is very critical 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.290
 we pass at zero speed fix 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.940
 what we do is the pilot puts the 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.380
 maximum motor power because it 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.630
 interest to reach speeds very soon 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.410
 for this squared to fire and 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.050
 get support to take what 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.030
 they call the pilots of the plane to the air 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.270
 going on air means that got 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:10.390
 that the speed is already such that high 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.280
 squared allows this to compensate for 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.200
 weight of the airplane and therefore the 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.050
 lift is greater than the weight and I 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.900
 I'm going to the air 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.509
 Well, these are basic notions , 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.509
 what I wanted is that you will stay with this 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:26.550
 first equation in cruise notice 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.490
 that will be equal to the weight of the plane 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.229
 w so in cruise this expression the 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.449
 you will see many times maybe with a medium 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:38.430
 of rock is that usually juve squared in 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.889
 cruise we're also going to go to the same 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.330
 Ro height is constant I carry two 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.000
 folded surfaces with which is the 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.129
 wing that constant and I will fly 11 usually 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.870
 alpha coast so you can see that 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:51.330
 in cruise the speed is in 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.879
 inconstant everything is constant for being 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.650
 good friends this has been a video 

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.050
 basic so you can see a little more 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:02.280
 ordered so basic a little more advanced 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.719
 but with very general ideas that 

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.509
 contributes to the support of an airplane 

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:08.699
 and what is the analytical formula for 

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:10.349
 work with the support of a mine 

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:12.690
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:14.400
 the video and we keep seeing in more 

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.550
 videos of the academy Mr. 5 up 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.550
 soon
