00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.630
 already existing in the world server 2008 r2 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.470
 for those who did not see watch the video 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.369
 installing here I had to go actor in the world server 2008 r2 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.470
 because this video continuation of him 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 for our example we will use the domain learn because the location that is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.660
 an existing domain that we created in the previous video 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.550
 let's go to the requirements 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.610
 run all updates from windows the pdt is important that the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.969
 server is 100% up-to-date 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.610
 this time and ready space 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.160
 so that in the 1930s 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 the next step is to join the server on Sunday will be promoted when I 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.210
 meeting 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 so come on 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.790
 she will have the name of the server here 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.360
 and I already left my state on Sunday the first one told Carol 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 protect our time, I did not stay either 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.810
 next step is to establish the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 so come on 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 already warns you to reiterate 6 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.060
 Let's impose losses to lose 4 I've already left 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.640
 fixed in perm 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.790
 and the important thing is that that of my beer which is our first of the man bought 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.120
 great spoken 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.210
 on the network 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 that's a 2008 0 10 so I was not 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.650
 the next step is to trigger the function here direct from the right man sitting the 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.470
 students to be a member 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.549
 Function 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.300
 pressed the function 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.040
 advance 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.330
 direct tim dawn dictionary dictionary 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.540
 spread 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 move forward install 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.499
 installation completed successfully 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.359
 the China 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.870
 and the next step is to perform the foam points do so let's go there 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.269
 in this sector with cheese and say 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.309
 opened installation I do not vote explaining all the exchanges screens here 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.309
 because I explained the first wine so let's move on 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.459
 to advance here is an already existing forest and the man 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.829
 control for an existing domain the first option 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.729
 advance 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.919
 here is the domain name front of the additional learn local point ' 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.379
 and here the challenge side as agent of the domino tennis has already identified the 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.859
 aphrodisiacs let's move forward 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.909
 domain learn with change forward 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.129
 here it will be in the standard ct let's move forward 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.549
 good the one of the option for us 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.809
 This vacancy in series B 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.159
 in this period 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.989
 starts marked 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.309
 and that already the option also to uncheck the global catalog 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.230
 because it is not the first of the meeting already having the meeting on Sunday 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.989
 but we'll leave it to capturing it globally as well 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.540
 and this one has the option to make the name found only iturra cleaner 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.959
 in this example we are not doing 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.349
 so let's move forward 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.639
 here in giving the notice informing a delegation of the table can be created 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.159

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:45.929
 he takes the password 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.929
 in a statement 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.619
 advance 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:54.480
 and is wanted installation reason 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.409

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.610
 So we have two eat four years 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.449
 the global catalog 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.479
 we can also stay here, it's already a good dns server 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.770
 spare 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
