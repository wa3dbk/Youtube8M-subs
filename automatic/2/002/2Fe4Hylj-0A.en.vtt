00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.140
 billions of human beings populate the planet 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.749
 to feed this population 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.749
 we had to increase food production 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.329
 the use of fertilizers in agriculture allowed this increase 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.379
 increasing the production of the fields of crop 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.870
 during the 19th century 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.080
 the only complete and concentrated fertilizer that was available in the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.529
 world for several decades was 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.529
 the Peruvian guano 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.230
 sometimes guards 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 the most valuable birds in the world 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.470
 guano is the accumulation of the excrement of seabirds 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 the birds that produce it are the guano birds 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.260
 the main guano areas are the pelican, the piquero 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.240
 and the guanare 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.389
 eluana and that is the most abundant 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:01.489
 and together with the other species formed pandas of millions of birds that covered 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.790
 heaven 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.850
 these birds 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.189
 they could become so numerous 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.419
 thanks to the immense goodness the anchoveta yields its main food 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.430
 but the sea 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.990
 It also makes the Peruvian coast one of the driest climates in the world 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.850
 usually 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.719
 it does not rain 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.640
 and there are only garÃºas 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.899
 this prevents the guano from dissolving 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.430
 deposited on the ground 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.829
 keeping like this 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.210
 a high nitrogen content 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.030
 for hundreds of years 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 the guano accumulated in the islands and islets 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.650
 of the Peruvian coast 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 at the beginning of the 19th century 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 European scientists learned from the Peruvian settlers 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.020
 about the use of this fertilizer 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.770
 and they realized how useful it would be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.220
 in the agriculture of their countries 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.490
 the guano started exporting 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.520
 the guano was extracted as if it were a mineral 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 between 1840 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.280
 and 1880 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.680
 Peru exported 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 12 eat 7 million tons of guano 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.979
 with an equivalent value to today 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.219
 of 13 billion dollars peru 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.629
 It was very rich but like all mining 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.629
 the resource when it's over 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.780
 but the when 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.179
 It is not a mineral 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:24.629
 the guano is produced by birds and the mining activity frightened them with nothing 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.279
 it was done for them 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.989
 a group of experts realized that taking care of them while preserving these 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.019
 could increase in number if produce and accumulate when it was possible that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.709
 return to be the Peruvian guano industry but now to favor the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.189
 Peruvian agriculture 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:48.749
 In 1909, the guano management company was created. 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.519
 the islands had to become sanctuaries of birds and the almost the collection 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.019
 of eggs should be suspended 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 the extraction had to be ordered 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.470
 no guano should be extracted 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.470
 when the greatest number of birds was reproducing 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:10.129
 there should be a period of several years between guano extraction campaigns 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.159
 more years better 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.159
 it was necessary to guarantee the quality of the water they have extracted 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.710
 maintain a surveillance system on the islands 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.290
 and in the coastal area to prevent birds from being disturbed 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.350
 establish a permanent group of scientists 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.160
 that assess the status of bird populations and their environment 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.299
 the bird population and the production of guano began to grow 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.349
 the researchers realized that two factors were important for 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.690
 increase the size 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.109
 of the bird population 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.269
 the food the anchoveta 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.760
 from time to time it decreased dramatically due to the occurrence of 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.659
 event the child 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.399
 and the nesting area for which birds competed by increasing their number 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.259
 As with food, little could be done 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.179
 we worked on what could be controlled 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.259
 the nesting area 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.489
 the guano management company 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.969
 built walls to create 14 artificial islands at the ends of the coast 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.459
 Peruvian 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 the population of birds and the production of guano increased 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.909
 considerably 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.350
 the year 1956 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.100
 they produced more than three hundred thirty two thousand tons 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.740
 of the best natural fertilizer in the world 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.860
 obtained from more than 33 million guano birds 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.180
 income 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.710
 allowed to have a team of scientists 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.290
 that investigated the ocean 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.110
 and another team dedicated to agricultural research on how to better use the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.099
 guano 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.480
 in your investigations 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.610
 were disseminated to the general public through newsletters and memoirs 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.990
 Peru 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.380
 It was recognized as having the largest industry in the world 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.860
 based on the conservation of wild animals 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.960
 in the mid-50s 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.030
 the development of the anchoveta industrial fishery began 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.129
 initially promoted by the company's own scientists 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.279
 guano administrator 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.099
 but this became a problem to which others joined 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.110
 the Peruvian guano industry if the guano bird populations were 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.100
 affected by competition with the fishery the occurrence of a server 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.670
 event the child and the competition with interests to establish plants of 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.469
 production of artificial fertilizers 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.950
 it was even said that the guano birds 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.319
 it was a threat to the national development of Peru 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.509
 the guano management company 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.540
 it was deactivated 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.540
 to create the national fertilizer corporation 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.360
 the regulations that protected the guano birds and the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.939
 population of these birds 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.939
 decreased to 615 thousand individuals 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.169
 but the guano birds did not become extinct 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.300
 and the administration of the guano-tip islands 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.280
 He went from the national fertilizer corporation 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.750
 up to the current 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.740
 special project to promote the use 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.280
 of fertilizers from seabirds 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.419
 we try 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.629
 We test is aimed at the conservation of marine biodiversity 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:21.760
 The recollection 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.810
 processing and marketing of guano from the islands and administering and practicing 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.460
 domain 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.860
 on the 22 islands and nine points of the Peruvian coast 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.490
 the protection work on some islands and guano points have allowed 

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:39.599
 the modest recovery of the guano bird populations 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.190
 plus 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.810
 that of other bird species like the jumbo penguins 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.250
 in marine mammals 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.180
 like the sea lions 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.240
 at present 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.699
 there are good opportunities for our when and our guano birds 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.819
 the world demand 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.389
 of organic products made from seabird guano 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.939
 an exceptional fertilizer 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.049
 Synthetic fertilizers have gone up enormously in prices 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.370
 improving the protection of the islands and guano points 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.669
 knowing the marine environment better and using the best way 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.860
 marine resources available 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.050
 if it was possible that our guano birds 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.889
 return to be the most valuable birds in the world
