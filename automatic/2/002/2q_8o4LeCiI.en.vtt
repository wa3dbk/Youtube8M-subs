Lita has learned from previous attacks
that<00:04:57.300> he<00:04:57.450> needs<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.720> stay<00:04:57.960> there<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.380> defend

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
gasps mean stop some mining a little bit

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.990 
gasps mean stop some mining a little bit
that<00:05:07.680> natural<00:05:08.130> expansion<00:05:08.340> but<00:05:08.610> he<00:05:08.700> hasn't

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
that natural expansion but he hasn't

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.380 
that natural expansion but he hasn't
really<00:05:09.180> taken<00:05:09.330> out<00:05:09.570> anything<00:05:10.050> else<00:05:10.200> important

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
really taken out anything else important

he's finally coming in here now with
lurkers<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.310> looks<00:05:14.460> like<00:05:14.580> there's<00:05:14.730> not<00:05:14.880> enough

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
lurkers it looks like there's not enough

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.740 
lurkers it looks like there's not enough
to<00:05:15.180> defend<00:05:15.420> again<00:05:15.840> for<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.500> gas<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.750> looks

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
to defend again for the gas so looks

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.270 
to defend again for the gas so looks
like<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.990> radiate<00:05:19.380> on<00:05:19.560> both<00:05:19.770> workers<00:05:20.010> so

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
like the radiate on both workers so

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.160 
like the radiate on both workers so
those<00:05:20.430> workers<00:05:20.610> won't<00:05:20.850> be<00:05:21.030> alive<00:05:21.300> too<00:05:21.900> much

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
those workers won't be alive too much

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.610 
those workers won't be alive too much
longer<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:24.480> now<00:05:24.660> by<00:05:24.810> heroes<00:05:25.170> working<00:05:25.500> from

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.710 
longer and now by heroes working from
two<00:05:25.770> bases<00:05:26.160> again<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:26.880> as<00:05:27.000> macro<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.450> kind<00:05:27.660> of

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
two bases again so as macro is kind of

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.450 
two bases again so as macro is kind of
failing<00:05:28.050> him<00:05:28.140> there<00:05:28.320> Lita<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.950> getting<00:05:29.340> his

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
failing him there Lita is getting his

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.890 
failing him there Lita is getting his
third<00:05:29.640> base<00:05:29.880> i<00:05:30.060> think<00:05:30.120> his<00:05:30.270> third<00:05:30.480> base<00:05:30.660> might

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
third base i think his third base might

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.740 
third base i think his third base might
be<00:05:31.020> up<00:05:31.140> and<00:05:31.290> running<00:05:31.440> already<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:33.120> heroes<00:05:33.480> in

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
be up and running already so heroes in

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.810 
be up and running already so heroes in
major<00:05:34.230> trouble<00:05:34.530> here<00:05:34.740> he<00:05:35.010> should<00:05:35.220> have<00:05:35.310> been<00:05:35.790> a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
major trouble here he should have been a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.700 
major trouble here he should have been a
little<00:05:36.090> bit<00:05:36.360> more<00:05:36.510> aggressive<00:05:36.660> earlier<00:05:37.560> in

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
little bit more aggressive earlier in

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.890 
little bit more aggressive earlier in
the<00:05:37.800> game<00:05:37.880> it<00:05:38.880> looks<00:05:39.090> like<00:05:39.150> Lita<00:05:39.420> is<00:05:39.510> going<00:05:39.810> to

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
the game it looks like Lita is going to

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.200 
the game it looks like Lita is going to
take<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.290> radiate<00:05:40.890> on<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.220> Defiler<00:05:41.940> in<00:05:42.090> the

waypoints for his buildings Lita is kind

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.230 
waypoints for his buildings Lita is kind
of<00:06:16.830> wiping<00:06:17.070> his<00:06:17.160> nose<00:06:17.220> there<00:06:17.640> I<00:06:17.670> think<00:06:18.000> he

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
of wiping his nose there I think he

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.260 
of wiping his nose there I think he
knows<00:06:18.450> that<00:06:18.930> he<00:06:19.050> pretty<00:06:19.230> much<00:06:19.320> has<00:06:19.590> this<00:06:19.740> game

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
knows that he pretty much has this game

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.720 
knows that he pretty much has this game
if<00:06:21.270> he<00:06:21.420> can<00:06:21.600> keep<00:06:21.840> by<00:06:22.500> hero<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:23.040> his<00:06:23.220> face<00:06:23.430> keep

if he can keep by hero in his face keep

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.100 
if he can keep by hero in his face keep
him<00:06:23.850> from<00:06:24.000> expanding<00:06:24.510> long<00:06:24.690> enough<00:06:27.110> more

zerglings<00:06:28.680> this<00:06:29.070> is<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.280> same<00:06:29.550> old<00:06:29.790> trick

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
zerglings this is the same old trick

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.910 
zerglings this is the same old trick
from<00:06:30.150> by<00:06:30.300> hero<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.630> think<00:06:30.870> this<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:31.110> this<00:06:31.740> was

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
from by hero I think this is this was

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.230 
from by hero I think this is this was
pretty<00:06:32.100> much<00:06:32.250> his<00:06:32.400> only<00:06:32.640> plan<00:06:32.820> going<00:06:33.030> into

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
pretty much his only plan going into

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.510 
pretty much his only plan going into
this<00:06:33.420> too<00:06:33.690> sends<00:06:34.050> her<00:06:34.140> limbs<00:06:34.380> down<00:06:34.590> there<00:06:34.830> to

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
this too sends her limbs down there to

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.790 
this too sends her limbs down there to
take<00:06:35.670> out<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:35.910> gas<00:06:36.060> or<00:06:36.300> whatever<00:06:36.450> and<00:06:37.440> he's

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
take out the gas or whatever and he's

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.250 
take out the gas or whatever and he's
sticking<00:06:38.010> with<00:06:38.280> his<00:06:38.430> plan<00:06:38.700> which<00:06:39.540> is<00:06:39.780> not

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
sticking with his plan which is not

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.490 
sticking with his plan which is not
going

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
going

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.770 
going
work<00:06:40.590> out<00:06:40.740> too<00:06:40.920> well<00:06:41.250> for<00:06:41.400> him<00:06:41.730> now<00:06:42.390> that<00:06:42.600> Leda

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
work out too well for him now that Leda

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.590 
work out too well for him now that Leda
is<00:06:42.930> coming<00:06:43.200> behind<00:06:43.350> his<00:06:43.680> base<00:06:44.540> kind<00:06:45.540> of

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
is coming behind his base kind of

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.720 
is coming behind his base kind of
incredible<00:06:45.840> that<00:06:46.260> by<00:06:46.470> hero<00:06:46.740> broke<00:06:47.400> his<00:06:47.580> own

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
incredible that by hero broke his own

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.520 
incredible that by hero broke his own
map<00:06:47.910> artifact<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.600> loudly<00:06:48.840> to<00:06:49.230> get<00:06:49.380> back

there the eraser trick going to take

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.280 
there the eraser trick going to take
down<00:06:51.630> a<00:06:51.690> ton<00:06:52.110> of<00:06:52.970> drones<00:06:53.970> there<00:06:54.330> I<00:06:54.600> was<00:06:55.200> looking

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
down a ton of drones there I was looking

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.810 
down a ton of drones there I was looking
bad<00:06:55.710> for<00:06:55.740> my<00:06:56.040> hero<00:06:56.310> GG<00:06:57.180> from<00:06:58.140> by<00:06:58.380> hero<00:06:58.820> Leda

with that one he stayed at two bases a

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.670 
with that one he stayed at two bases a
little<00:07:09.300> bit<00:07:09.420> too<00:07:09.570> long<00:07:09.750> without<00:07:10.230> being
