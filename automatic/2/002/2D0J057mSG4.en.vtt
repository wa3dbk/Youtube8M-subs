00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
actually put 2 3 volt lithium batteries

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.509 
actually put 2 3 volt lithium batteries
on<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.690> post<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> one<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:14.370> pretty

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
on it the post just the one it's pretty

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
bright with just the one battery but I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.120 
bright with just the one battery but I
figured<00:00:16.109> having<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.560> it'll<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.890> little<00:00:16.980> bit

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
figured having to it'll be a little bit

enough<00:00:22.260> duct<00:00:22.410> tape<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.800> electrical<00:00:23.250> tape

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
enough duct tape use electrical tape

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.790 
enough duct tape use electrical tape
holding<00:00:23.730> together<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.470> soon<00:00:25.680> as

pier finger placement we're taking our
reactor<00:01:34.210> fly<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.420> thing<00:01:36.790> hole<00:01:37.790> go<00:01:38.480> ahead<00:01:38.660> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
reactor fly that thing hole go ahead and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.610 
reactor fly that thing hole go ahead and
check<00:01:38.960> through<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.200> back<00:01:39.380> make<00:01:39.590> sure

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
check through the back make sure

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.540 
check through the back make sure
everything's<00:01:40.010> through<00:01:40.190> properly<00:01:40.550> in<00:01:41.240> today's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
everything's through properly in today's

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.530 
everything's through properly in today's
so<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.580> think<00:01:43.729> it<00:01:43.910> see<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.180> lot<00:01:44.330> brighter

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
so I think it see it's a lot brighter

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.990 
so I think it see it's a lot brighter
than<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.810> previous<00:01:45.200> version<00:01:45.350> with<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.220> 13

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
than a previous version with just a 13

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.090 
than a previous version with just a 13
volt<00:01:47.180> lithium<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.620> can<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:48.770> also

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
volt lithium and as you can see also

when<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.280> turned<00:01:49.460> sideways<00:01:50.229> it's<00:01:51.229> still<00:01:51.440> the
