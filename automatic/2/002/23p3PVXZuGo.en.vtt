00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.040
 will also need a can of milk 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.730
 condensed milk girl in case I used 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.650
 half a can and a half there rate you might be 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.640
 using a little more than half a can or 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.450
 less dependent on the both of you 2 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.890
 like, huh 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.410
 in the case of the half tin I think it is ideal 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.050
 for this recipe and you will also need 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.869
 of a can of sour cream and here 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.909
 also a sachet of grape juice in the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.249
 If I chose grapes, you may be 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.880
 choosing from strawberry or some other 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.770
 flavor 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.999
 since it is for a liter already comes sweetened 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.369
 more can be also can be without 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:21.850
 sweetener already in the south the sun just a little bit 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.399
 no sweet up and is as follows you go 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 use an electric mixer but in this case 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.450
 do not have a mixer you could be 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.130
 also doing in the blender 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.139
 Ok, let's go then the sequence is the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.639
 next you will hit the sour cream 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:39.279
 will not let whipped cream you 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:44.289
 it will only give a slight thickening 

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:47.829
 touch and done that you will add 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.209
 natural orkut and hit to mix 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.520
 It gets well mixed. 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.369
 a spoon in the bottom of the pot here is 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.689
 for certified and was what the well was 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.419
 well mixed 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.639
 then the next sequence and then you 

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:02.469
 is going to add the milk girl goes will 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.499
 stirring goes here turns on and 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:10.890
 adding that it will slightly right 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:13.430
 As you like, there you go. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.950
 put a whole can or too much 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.819
 It will get very sweet so I do not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.739
 I advise and done it, you will. 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.090
 cancel the check in play and will clear 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.950
 a little bit in a bit of a stir 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.049
 running round you 're everything 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.390
 done this you give another stir and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.680
 then again and gradually 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.000
 stirring with the spoon to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.799
 well mixed dinho ok 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 then it will look more or less like this 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 consistency here is more or less 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.389
 Digg this consistency even're 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.170
 seeing 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:47.450
 only that when taking to the refrigerator how much 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.349
 The more time you leave later, it 's here. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.359
 It's ice cold and that's why if you eat 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.959
 the next day in the case if e.g. 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.909
 do today and run tomorrow he will stay 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.290
 very tasty how much longer in the 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.810
 refrigerator it will get more consistent 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.950
 will still be more consistent than 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.689
 This is where you see him going. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.510
 thicken further right 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:12.590
 after you put it in the fridge and it's the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.340
 next this pot I'm going to use 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.139

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.629
 remaining 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.419
 So do not throw it away, and empty it . 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.340
