00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.750
 very good and welcome to um boxing 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 from lg flex 2 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.780
 well to begin we will teach a little bit 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.970
 the box is a normal box 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.580
 it has no novelty or anything strange 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.380
 in the back we can see 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.110
 some of the features like 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.100
 example that the screen is a pellet of 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.770
 5.5 inches to 1080 we have also 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.129
 fast loading and that the back of 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.590
 this terminal is self repairable well 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.920
 we open the box and we see that we have the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.980
 gray gray titanium model but 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.870
 is the 2 gb ram model is not the one that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.670
 has 3 gigas of ram because because this one 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.950
 It has 16 gigs of internal storage 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 instead of 32 that's why it takes only two 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.030
 gigas of ram inside the box 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.690
 we see that we have the typical little pieces of paper 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.580
 that we get the charger that I eat 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.619
 we can read the back part puts 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.420
 fasta charger that will make us 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.860
 charge our 3000 thousand battery 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 amps in a more or less time 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.649
 reasonable also comes a cable 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.410
 normal and usb micro usb 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.100
 black color and we also come the 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.200
 lg headphones that are pin- type heart 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.850
 well we went to look at the smartphone 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.009
 smartphone that carries inside 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.390
 apart from the 2 gb of ram because it's the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.190
 16gb model carries the snapdragon 810 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.399
 which is 8 cores and with one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.490
 64 - bit architecture like the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.830
 lg 3 on the sides we will not find 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.750
 no type of button what yes 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 we will find in the top part it will be 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.250
 the microphone to cancel the noise and the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.649
 infrared to be able to handle by 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.240
 example our TVs while 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.429
 that the bottom part we find the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 jack to connect the headphones the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.610
 microphone and the microusb connector if we 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.800
 we fixed well we can see a kind of 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.740
 movie that that's the treatment that 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.869
 you have this device so you can auto 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.399
 repair the scratches is not that you have a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.150
 plastic put is a kind of 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.069
 painting 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.130
 that's why we also see that it's a bit more 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.200
 bright has a finish like gloss and 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.200
 brighter than maybe the lg 3 that does not 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.670
 Has this anti scratch finish or author 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.739
 palante 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.360
 the lid is removable what is not 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.799
 removable is the 3000 battery 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.730
 milliamps this time we can not 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.370
 remove 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.659
 like on axis 3 and that we could what 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.610
 yes we found in the bottom 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.590
 is the speaker that is placed in the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.780
 same position as axis 3 and that also 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.970
 sounds in a similar way sounds pretty 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.890
 well in the upper right 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.890
 we have the space to put our 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.090
 microsim card and over I would put the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.769
 micro SD card up to 128 GB in the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.900
 central part we have the classic 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.900
 lone keypad with the button 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.629
 blocking in the center and that of climbing and 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.140
 lower volume up and down and the camera 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.750
 13 megapixel with laser focus 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.540
 so characteristic of the lg besides 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 a double color led flash we remove the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.129
 plastic front to be able to see your 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.900
 screen and the different sensors and the 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.480
 front camera that has in the part of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.760
 up has the sensors and the camera 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.180
 which is 2 megapixels capable of recording 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.890
 to 1080 at the bottom the only thing that 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.049
 we found is the logo of the axis since 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.209
 the buttons are inside the screen 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.489
 certainly the chrome frame that 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.480
 shines so much I would say it's plastic 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.209
 almost sure because it does not weigh or 155 grams 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.330
 it looks very light and I would bet that this 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.650
 It is plastic painted chrome while 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.349
 we make the first understood we are going to 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.019
 Compare it in size against the samsung 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.069
 galaxy to 5 that I have around here so that 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.959
 do you have an idea of ​​the dimensions 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.480
 that has one in front of the other 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.879
 Galaxy 5 has 5 inches of 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.930
 screen while the flex 2 has 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.910
 5.5 as in the LG g3 we can see 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.620
 that take advantage of the size of the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.440
 terminal and get to put a screen 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.680
 5.5 inches in a pretty space 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.480
 reduced when we put them one against 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.450
 the other we can see the curvature that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.400
 has the lex gef all besides this 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.310
 screen has the characteristic that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.139
 it's a bit flexible so it will be a 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.000
 little more protected in the event that we 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.669
 put the device in some pocket 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.710
 of some pants that are very narrow and 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.560
 maybe with a screen that was not 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.270
 curved and that can be doubled 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.770
 maybe we would split the screen to 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.970
 sit in the car or somewhere 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 in this case the lg reflex 2 helps 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.590
 this does not happen thanks to its screen 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.330
 curved and flexible 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.980
