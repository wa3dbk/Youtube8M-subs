second row captains chairs those could

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
second row captains chairs those could
be<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> problem<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:12.120> taller<00:02:12.390> car<00:02:12.660> seats

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
be a problem with some taller car seats
but<00:02:13.050> they<00:02:13.170> were<00:02:13.260> not

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
but they were not

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.830 
but they were not
problem<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.849> graco<00:02:15.359> head<00:02:15.599> wise<00:02:15.859> 70<00:02:17.840> and

problem with this graco head wise 70 and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.429 
problem with this graco head wise 70 and
you<00:02:19.829> can<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.219> there<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.670> latch<00:02:21.140> for<00:02:22.140> the

that<00:02:45.930> could<00:02:46.079> be<00:02:46.169> a<00:02:46.200> problem<00:02:46.349> if<00:02:46.739> they<00:02:46.769> are<00:02:46.950> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that could be a problem if they are a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.399 
that could be a problem if they are a
little<00:02:47.159> bit<00:02:47.400> wider<00:02:47.609> or<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> design<00:02:49.379> that

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
little bit wider or have a design that

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
may not perfectly puzzle in there so

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.899 
may not perfectly puzzle in there so
that's<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.650> consideration<00:02:53.189> with<00:02:53.489> those<00:02:53.639> fixed

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
that's a consideration with those fixed

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
buckle stocks but they do tend to be a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.740 
buckle stocks but they do tend to be a
little<00:02:55.950> bit<00:02:56.099> easier<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.060> longer<00:02:57.569> ones

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
little bit easier for the longer ones

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.119 
little bit easier for the longer ones
for<00:02:57.959> kids<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.290> buckle<00:02:58.530> themselves<00:02:58.980> and

for kids to buckle themselves and

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.780 
for kids to buckle themselves and
boosters<00:02:59.459> so<00:03:00.389> some<00:03:00.629> pros<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.049> cons<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.439> that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
boosters so some pros and cons to that

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.149 
boosters so some pros and cons to that
we'll<00:03:02.790> take<00:03:02.969> a<00:03:03.000> look<00:03:03.239> at<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.500> third<00:03:04.680> row<00:03:04.919> with

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.899 
the latch anchors you can see buried
only<00:03:52.169> slightly<00:03:52.470> down<00:03:52.799> between<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.430> seats<00:03:53.669> the

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
only slightly down between the seats the

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.330 
only slightly down between the seats the
third<00:03:54.090> row<00:03:54.359> pretty<00:03:55.109> typical<00:03:55.379> there's<00:03:56.189> no

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
third row pretty typical there's no

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.399 
third row pretty typical there's no
crossover<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:57.060> belts<00:03:57.449> so<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.989> may<00:03:58.169> make<00:03:58.349> it

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
crossover of belts so that may make it

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.189 
crossover of belts so that may make it
easy<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.459> get<00:03:59.669> three<00:04:00.150> car<00:04:00.359> seats<00:04:00.389> adjacent<00:04:01.079> but

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
easy to get three car seats adjacent but

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.409 
easy to get three car seats adjacent but
it<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.439> fairly<00:04:01.739> narrow<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.939> that's<00:04:03.120> something

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
it is fairly narrow so that's something

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.619 
it is fairly narrow so that's something
to<00:04:03.599> consider<00:04:03.780> when<00:04:04.349> you<00:04:05.129> are<00:04:05.629> installing

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
to consider when you are installing

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.179 
to consider when you are installing
three<00:04:07.049> seats<00:04:07.290> you'll<00:04:07.409> have<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.739> select<00:04:07.949> very

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
three seats you'll have to select very

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.469 
three seats you'll have to select very
carefully<00:04:08.729> if<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.879> are<00:04:08.970> trying<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.299> get<00:04:09.419> a

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
carefully if you are trying to get a

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.749 
carefully if you are trying to get a
three<00:04:09.750> across<00:04:10.019> situation<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.829> there<00:04:11.099> the

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
three across situation back there the

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.969 
three across situation back there the
center<00:04:12.239> shoulder<00:04:12.659> belt<00:04:12.900> does<00:04:13.290> come<00:04:13.560> from<00:04:13.859> the

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
center shoulder belt does come from the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.490 
center shoulder belt does come from the
ceiling<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.669> that<00:04:14.849> is<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> consideration

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
ceiling so that is a consideration

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.560 
ceiling so that is a consideration
pretty<00:04:16.500> typical<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.979> many<00:04:17.159> vehicles<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
pretty typical of many vehicles the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.509 
pretty typical of many vehicles the
shoulder<00:04:18.900> belts<00:04:19.229> are<00:04:19.349> not<00:04:19.500> adjustable<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:20.250> any

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
shoulder belts are not adjustable in any

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.459 
shoulder belts are not adjustable in any
of<00:04:20.759> the<00:04:20.880> rear<00:04:21.030> seating<00:04:21.299> positions<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.440> that

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
of the rear seating positions so that

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.379 
of the rear seating positions so that
may<00:04:22.740> be<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.889> consideration<00:04:23.340> for<00:04:23.789> teens<00:04:24.060> and

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
may be a consideration for teens and

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.840 
may be a consideration for teens and
older<00:04:24.719> kids<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.200> boosters<00:04:25.669> that
