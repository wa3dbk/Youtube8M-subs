00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello welcome to a little video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.269
 I wanted to number what to do 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.940
 say say minecraft completely 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.160
 yes and indeed wanted to come yes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.400
 new update out and there it is still one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.109
 bit different because the texture pack 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 and I just wanted to explain it that way 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 how it works 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.699
 now I have one as such 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 self-created text from eckball of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.829
 from the side penteli that would be so now 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.420
 not work anymore like then 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.790
 it's not even possible to do anything like that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.510
 I had it where it is possible 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.070
 you create that on a yes that me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 once again new folder the whole stuff 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.620
 table unpack in there does all 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.440
 again to go to the new folder and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.270
 grabs that for example me 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.189
 so I can say now 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 okay and then very important 17 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.210
 and that would be a texture pack new 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.240
 year 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.740
 For example, there are two new ones 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.570
 things and once that the pag png 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 that is already on Thursdays opec and the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.979
 pag text so you do it when you get it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 also needs to pack in here 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 that means that after packing heavy 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.970
 Now go and say here the pag 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.979
 text as an okay but just at 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.229
 do it at the same time and put it in there 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.360
 I 'll explain what it is 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.939
 is as much to explain as me 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 put a new texture pack 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.450
 yes, I'll go to rap 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 switch over to show just like that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.400
 whole 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.310
 in game then it works like that I am 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 now here in minecraft 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 we now see the new menu of the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 version 1.2 point 2 carpet to texts like 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 you look at watson texture pack that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.590
 is that interesting there we see already 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.700
 there you need it so it was okay then 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.590
 I say friend now in the video unfortunately 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210
 not shown i just send you 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.280
 on it 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.280
 this is our open texture pack folder 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.980
 data domain point minecraft texture pack 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.860
 is a folder there would be the zip files 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.720
 which he put in here was the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.209
 Folders put the file in if we 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.980
 right here I have now 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.240
 talk spec is activated 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.730
 I take mine now and then do it 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.870
 is it the singleplayer in one 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 third world 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.580
 and then you can see it now 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.760
 there is now even created this 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.260
 penta dear corner in it so that 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.020
 it just works just now 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.120
 at least it should only be so 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.319
 but that works you can 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.260
 said to it but how well the pag png 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.750
 is the picture and the pag text is this 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.640
 small description here you can 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.230
 I can write pictures 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.030
 a photoshop then let's play 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.570
 writing my own picnic it stands 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.280
 here below 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.019
 These are actually a few innovations 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.060
 like the multiplayer, they became like that 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.250
 Vessel and singleplayer also multiplayer 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.780
 for example the mine cards and the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.739
 were just for that too 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.519
 update and how to then texture pack ins 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.519
 play purely, I'll thank you for 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.519
