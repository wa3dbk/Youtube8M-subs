strengths I when I go dual wield i
usually<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.830> dual<00:00:32.160> wield<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
usually use dual wield just like a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
usually use dual wield just like a
shotgun<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.719> anything<00:00:34.050> past<00:00:34.440> medium

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
shotgun if it's anything past medium

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.950 
shotgun if it's anything past medium
range<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.430> chased<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.809> why

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
range I just chased them down that's why

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.930 
range I just chased them down that's why
I<00:00:36.989> consider<00:00:37.380> marathon<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> plus<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> any<00:00:38.730> kind

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I consider marathon a plus for any kind

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
I consider marathon a plus for any kind
of<00:00:39.059> dual<00:00:39.270> wield<00:00:39.540> kit<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:41.070> used

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of dual wield kit and I used

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
of dual wield kit and I used
sleight-of-hand<00:00:42.149> mainly<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.899> don't

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
sleight-of-hand mainly because I don't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229 
sleight-of-hand mainly because I don't
expect<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.680> kill<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.460> person<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
expect to kill more than one person at a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.619 
expect to kill more than one person at a
time<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.890> 40<00:00:47.280> bullets<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.450> that's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
time with with all 40 bullets and that's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
time with with all 40 bullets and that's
another<00:00:48.899> reason<00:00:49.020> why<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> scavenger

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
another reason why I have the scavenger

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
another reason why I have the scavenger
pack<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.719> pretty<00:00:51.930> much<00:00:52.020> explains

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
pack on so that's pretty much explains

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
pack on so that's pretty much explains
my<00:00:52.620> kit<00:00:52.800> set<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> gate
