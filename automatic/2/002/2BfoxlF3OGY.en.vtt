00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
keys and I'm gonna use the input manager

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.760 
keys and I'm gonna use the input manager
to<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.750> easier<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.650> we

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
to make all of this much easier so if we

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
to make all of this much easier so if we
open<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.100> our<00:01:38.250> script<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.570> look<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
open up our script we can look at the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
open up our script we can look at the
way<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.170> did<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.759> doing<00:01:42.119> input<00:01:42.720> get

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
way we did this so we're doing input get

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
way we did this so we're doing input get
key<00:01:43.500> W<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.520> WASD<00:01:45.390> QE<00:01:45.930> +<00:01:46.380> spacebar<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:47.970> we

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
key W for WASD QE + spacebar now what we

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.060 
key W for WASD QE + spacebar now what we
want<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.509> instead<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> button

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
want to do instead is get the button

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.399 
want to do instead is get the button
from<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> input<00:01:51.030> manager<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> do

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
from the input manager the way we can do

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
from the input manager the way we can do
that<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.799> by<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.670> unity<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> going

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that is by going back to unity and going

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250 
that is by going back to unity and going
to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> input<00:01:55.140> manager

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.670

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
and do the horizontal first and we don't

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.510

actually need this equals equals true if
you<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.750> will<00:02:55.840> take<00:02:55.900> this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
you just do this it will take this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.810 
you just do this it will take this
method<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.770> return<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.130> true<00:02:57.430> or<00:02:57.610> false

been<00:03:00.280> pushed<00:03:00.550> or<00:03:00.700> not<00:03:00.850> we<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:01.750> go<00:03:01.930> down

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
been pushed or not we can then go down

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:11.240 
been pushed or not we can then go down
here<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.540> add<00:03:04.540> an<00:03:04.930> input<00:03:05.790> dot<00:03:06.790> get<00:03:07.209> axis

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.070 

horizontal<00:03:13.620> times<00:03:14.620> what<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.400> already<00:03:15.550> had<00:03:16.080> now

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
horizontal times what we already had now

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.170 
horizontal times what we already had now
what<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.410> does<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:18.070> input<00:03:18.280> dot<00:03:18.610> get<00:03:18.790> access

what this does this input dot get access

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
what this does this input dot get access
horizontal<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:20.050> returns<00:03:20.350> either<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.620> negative

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
horizontal it returns either a negative

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.890 
horizontal it returns either a negative
one<00:03:21.160> or<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> positive<00:03:21.880> one<00:03:22.030> depending<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.600> which

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
one or a positive one depending on which

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.470 
one or a positive one depending on which
key<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.040> positive<00:03:24.520> or<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.670> negative<00:03:24.730> key<00:03:25.270> is

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
key the positive or the negative key is

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.870 
key the positive or the negative key is
being<00:03:25.720> pressed<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.920> W<00:03:27.340> would<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.700> positive

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
being pressed so W would be the positive

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.030 
being pressed so W would be the positive
key<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.540> s<00:03:28.810> would<00:03:29.050> be<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.260> negative<00:03:29.410> key<00:03:29.770> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
key and s would be the negative key you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.920 
key and s would be the negative key you
can<00:03:30.220> kind<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.520> see<00:03:30.700> how<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.180> one<00:03:31.600> line

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
can kind of see how this one line

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.710 
can kind of see how this one line
actually<00:03:32.590> represents<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.489> line<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.120> this

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
actually represents this line and this

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.620 
actually represents this line and this
line<00:03:34.780> then<00:03:35.260> because<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.709> only<00:03:35.860> difference<00:03:36.010> is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
line then because the only difference is

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.780 
line then because the only difference is
one<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> negative<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.440> one<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.680> not<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.640> this

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
one is a negative and one is not so this

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.340 
one is a negative and one is not so this
will<00:03:39.940> automatically<00:03:40.450> determine<00:03:41.140> whether

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
will automatically determine whether

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.170 
will automatically determine whether
it's<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.620> negative<00:03:41.830> one<00:03:42.190> or<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> positive<00:03:42.730> one

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
it's a negative one or a positive one

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.290 
it's a negative one or a positive one
and<00:03:43.360> will<00:03:43.750> already<00:03:44.050> apply<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:45.000> now<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> can

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
and will already apply that now I can

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.420 
and will already apply that now I can
add<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.080> same<00:03:47.320> thing<00:03:52.980> except<00:03:53.980> this<00:03:54.160> time

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
add in the same thing except this time

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.130 
add in the same thing except this time
we're<00:03:54.640> going<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.790> get<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.120> vertical<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.989> we

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
we're going to get the vertical and we

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.310 
we're going to get the vertical and we
can<00:03:56.260> get<00:03:56.380> rid<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.660> then<00:03:58.660> we<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:58.840> add

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
can get rid of this and then we can add

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.080 
can get rid of this and then we can add
in<00:03:59.650> the<00:04:00.070> input<00:04:00.760> dot<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:02.140> axis<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
in the input dot get axis for the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.569 
in the input dot get axis for the
vertical

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.459 

multiply<00:04:07.579> it<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> now<00:04:09.079> we<00:04:09.109> have<00:04:09.349> our

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
multiply it so now we have our

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.949 
multiply it so now we have our
horizontal<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.219> our<00:04:10.370> vertical<00:04:10.640> our<00:04:11.000> WS<00:04:11.629> and

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
horizontal and our vertical our WS and

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.029 
horizontal and our vertical our WS and
our<00:04:12.170> ad<00:04:12.560> keys<00:04:12.829> but<00:04:13.640> not<00:04:13.819> only<00:04:13.939> that<00:04:14.109> since<00:04:15.109> the

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
our ad keys but not only that since the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.370 
our ad keys but not only that since the
primary<00:04:16.449> positive<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.570> negative<00:04:17.870> keys<00:04:18.079> for

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
primary positive and negative keys for

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.349 
primary positive and negative keys for
horizontal<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:18.949> vertical<00:04:19.430> are<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.180> arrow

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
horizontal and vertical are the arrow

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.749 
horizontal and vertical are the arrow
keys<00:04:20.750> those<00:04:21.709> will<00:04:21.949> also<00:04:22.310> work<00:04:22.490> for<00:04:22.550> the

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
keys those will also work for the

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.260 
keys those will also work for the
movement

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
movement

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.909 
movement
so<00:04:23.419> essentially<00:04:23.840> what<00:04:24.080> we've<00:04:24.229> done<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.710> we've

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
so essentially what we've done is we've

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.310 
so essentially what we've done is we've
transformed<00:04:25.580> these<00:04:26.060> lines<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.780> code<00:04:26.840> into

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
transformed these lines of code into

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.969 
transformed these lines of code into
these<00:04:28.220> lines<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.669> code<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.530> we<00:04:30.590> can<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.830> get

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
these lines of code so we can just get

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.379 
these lines of code so we can just get
rid<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:33.970> actually<00:04:34.970> what<00:04:35.090> we're<00:04:35.240> going<00:04:35.360> to

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
rid of that actually what we're going to

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.719 
rid of that actually what we're going to
want<00:04:35.539> to<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:35.810> is<00:04:36.080> change<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.979> transformed

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
want to do is change this transformed

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.640 
want to do is change this transformed
forward<00:04:39.009> to<00:04:40.009> transform<00:04:40.789> right<00:04:41.560> because<00:04:42.560> our

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
forward to transform right because our

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.960 
forward to transform right because our
horizontal<00:04:43.190> we<00:04:43.280> don't<00:04:43.460> want<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.699> be<00:04:43.789> moving

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
horizontal we don't want to be moving

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.640 
horizontal we don't want to be moving
forward<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.690> backward<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:45.229> want<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.530> be

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
forward and backward we want to be

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.279 
forward and backward we want to be
moving<00:04:45.919> left<00:04:46.099> and<00:04:46.220> right<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:47.900> we<00:04:48.020> could<00:04:48.169> build

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
moving left and right so we could build

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.510 
moving left and right so we could build
it<00:04:49.630> go<00:04:50.630> back<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.990> our<00:04:51.080> scene<00:04:51.349> and<00:04:51.530> test<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.099> out

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.719 

the<00:04:55.520> WASD<00:04:56.090> still<00:04:56.630> works<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.340> now<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.400> arrow

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
the WASD still works and now the arrow

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.020 
the WASD still works and now the arrow
keys<00:04:59.030> work<00:04:59.270> as<00:04:59.419> well<00:05:00.849> okay

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
keys work as well okay

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.939 
keys work as well okay
another<00:05:02.780> cool<00:05:02.990> thing<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.410> we<00:05:03.530> can<00:05:03.680> do<00:05:03.800> with

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
another cool thing that we can do with

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.790 
another cool thing that we can do with
the<00:05:04.039> input<00:05:04.310> manager<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.880> we<00:05:05.030> can<00:05:05.180> add<00:05:05.800> inputs

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
the input manager is we can add inputs

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.250 
the input manager is we can add inputs
so<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:07.699> can<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.090> in<00:05:08.270> here<00:05:08.860> name<00:05:09.860> this<00:05:10.180> rotation

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
so I can go in here name this rotation

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.890 
so I can go in here name this rotation
give<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.409> a<00:05:12.590> negative<00:05:13.190> button<00:05:13.430> Q<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.180> a

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
give it a negative button Q and a

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.920 
give it a negative button Q and a
positive<00:05:15.320> button<00:05:15.650> e<00:05:16.030> go<00:05:17.030> back<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.419> our<00:05:17.539> script

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
positive button e go back to our script

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.189 
positive button e go back to our script
take<00:05:18.680> this<00:05:20.560> copy<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.800> over<00:05:22.630> change<00:05:23.630> vertical

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
take this copy it over change vertical

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:32.379 
take this copy it over change vertical
to<00:05:24.320> rotation<00:05:25.000> get<00:05:26.000> this<00:05:29.530> change<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.740> out<00:05:31.389> and

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
to rotation get this change it out and

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.080 
to rotation get this change it out and
in<00:05:33.020> front<00:05:33.260> of<00:05:33.380> time.deltatime<00:05:34.159> here<00:05:34.940> we're

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
in front of time.deltatime here we're

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.950 
in front of time.deltatime here we're
gonna<00:05:35.210> add<00:05:36.159> input<00:05:37.159> dot<00:05:37.780> get<00:05:38.780> axis<00:05:40.960> for

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
gonna add input dot get axis for

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.890 
gonna add input dot get axis for
rotation<00:05:45.669> this<00:05:46.669> does<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:47.030> same<00:05:47.240> thing<00:05:47.539> as<00:05:47.720> all

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
rotation this does the same thing as all

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.210 
rotation this does the same thing as all
these<00:05:48.110> lines<00:05:48.639> so<00:05:49.639> actually<00:05:50.680> can<00:05:51.680> just<00:05:51.710> copy

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
these lines so actually can just copy

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.280 
these lines so actually can just copy
this

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
this

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.520 
this
now<00:05:55.580> we<00:05:56.580> can<00:05:56.790> build<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.240> go<00:05:57.750> back<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.110> our<00:05:58.200> scene

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
now we can build it go back to our scene

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:10.200 
now we can build it go back to our scene
test<00:05:59.100> out<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.790> rotation<00:06:04.100> yep<00:06:05.130> just<00:06:05.520> works

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.790 

the<00:06:10.690> same<00:06:10.930> as<00:06:11.110> when<00:06:11.260> we<00:06:11.290> first<00:06:11.410> put<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.130> in<00:06:12.280> and

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
the same as when we first put it in and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.980 
the same as when we first put it in and
the<00:06:14.800> last<00:06:15.010> thing<00:06:15.340> we<00:06:15.430> can<00:06:15.640> do<00:06:15.790> is<00:06:16.330> go<00:06:16.570> back<00:06:16.600> and

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
the last thing we can do is go back and

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.470 
the last thing we can do is go back and
change<00:06:17.500> this<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:18.100> get<00:06:19.050> button-down<00:06:21.480> change

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
change this to get button-down change

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.210 
change this to get button-down change
space<00:06:22.840> to<00:06:23.020> jump<00:06:23.850> get<00:06:24.850> rid<00:06:25.030> of<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.210> true<00:06:26.220> get

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
space to jump get rid of the true get

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.470 
space to jump get rid of the true get
rid<00:06:27.310> of<00:06:27.370> this<00:06:27.520> it<00:06:27.850> was<00:06:27.970> something<00:06:28.270> I<00:06:28.330> was<00:06:28.420> doing

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
rid of this it was something I was doing

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.110 
rid of this it was something I was doing
earlier<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.230> then<00:06:29.620> we've<00:06:29.770> got<00:06:29.920> our<00:06:30.070> jump<00:06:30.310> we

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
earlier and then we've got our jump we

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.360 
earlier and then we've got our jump we
build<00:06:31.360> it<00:06:31.510> we<00:06:31.840> go<00:06:31.960> back<00:06:32.140> to<00:06:32.290> the<00:06:32.380> scene<00:06:32.650> test

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
build it we go back to the scene test

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.020 
build it we go back to the scene test
out<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.640> jump<00:06:35.280> yep<00:06:38.490> now<00:06:39.490> something<00:06:39.850> that<00:06:39.880> I

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
out the jump yep now something that I

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.820 
out the jump yep now something that I
realized<00:06:40.270> before<00:06:40.900> was<00:06:41.260> going<00:06:41.530> on<00:06:41.650> with<00:06:41.770> the

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
realized before was going on with the

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.430 
realized before was going on with the
jump<00:06:42.070> as<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.370> can<00:06:42.550> actually<00:06:42.780> get<00:06:43.780> it<00:06:43.960> over<00:06:44.290> and

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
jump as you can actually get it over and

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.900 
jump as you can actually get it over and
over<00:06:44.650> again<00:06:44.740> it'll<00:06:45.040> go<00:06:45.220> up<00:06:45.400> I<00:06:45.550> know<00:06:45.640> that<00:06:45.820> we

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
over again it'll go up I know that we

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.550 
over again it'll go up I know that we
designed<00:06:46.300> it<00:06:46.480> so<00:06:46.690> that<00:06:46.870> when<00:06:46.990> you<00:06:47.110> hold<00:06:47.290> down

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
designed it so that when you hold down

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.650 
designed it so that when you hold down
the<00:06:47.800> space<00:06:48.460> bar<00:06:48.670> it<00:06:48.820> doesn't<00:06:48.970> keep<00:06:49.210> going<00:06:49.510> up

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
the space bar it doesn't keep going up

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.030 
the space bar it doesn't keep going up
but<00:06:50.050> now<00:06:50.170> you<00:06:50.230> can<00:06:50.440> click<00:06:50.620> it<00:06:50.740> a<00:06:50.800> bunch<00:06:50.920> of

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
but now you can click it a bunch of

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.560 
but now you can click it a bunch of
times<00:06:51.100> which<00:06:51.520> doesn't<00:06:52.030> make<00:06:52.120> a<00:06:52.180> whole<00:06:52.420> lot<00:06:52.540> of

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
times which doesn't make a whole lot of

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.480 
times which doesn't make a whole lot of
sense<00:06:52.780> either<00:06:53.050> so<00:06:53.350> a<00:06:53.620> way<00:06:53.830> we<00:06:53.980> can<00:06:54.130> get<00:06:54.250> rid<00:06:54.460> of

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
sense either so a way we can get rid of

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.430 
sense either so a way we can get rid of
that<00:06:54.730> is<00:06:55.060> by<00:06:55.090> going<00:06:55.510> back<00:06:55.690> to<00:06:55.720> the<00:06:55.840> script<00:06:56.230> and

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
that is by going back to the script and

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.570 
that is by going back to the script and
in<00:06:56.710> this<00:06:56.920> if<00:06:57.130> statement<00:06:57.820> we<00:06:58.030> can<00:06:58.060> put<00:06:58.420> an<00:06:58.540> end

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
in this if statement we can put an end

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.420 
in this if statement we can put an end

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
we want to do this is because if we look

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.140 
we want to do this is because if we look
at<00:07:10.660> our<00:07:10.750> cube<00:07:11.170> our<00:07:11.410> player<00:07:12.310> and<00:07:12.610> we<00:07:12.820> look<00:07:13.030> at

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
at our cube our player and we look at

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.270 
at our cube our player and we look at
the<00:07:13.240> Y<00:07:13.420> position<00:07:13.720> when<00:07:14.410> it's<00:07:14.560> down<00:07:14.890> on<00:07:15.160> the

the Y position when it's down on the

the Y position when it's down on the

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
ground it's at point four eight so it's

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520 
ground it's at point four eight so it's
gonna<00:07:18.610> be<00:07:18.790> under<00:07:19.000> five<00:07:19.210> now<00:07:19.990> if<00:07:20.020> I<00:07:20.170> want<00:07:20.350> to<00:07:20.410> get

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
gonna be under five now if I want to get

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.140 
gonna be under five now if I want to get
really<00:07:20.710> strict<00:07:21.190> I<00:07:21.310> could<00:07:21.490> put<00:07:21.640> point<00:07:21.880> four

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
really strict I could put point four

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.440 
really strict I could put point four
eight<00:07:23.190> now<00:07:26.250> it<00:07:27.250> waits<00:07:27.490> for<00:07:27.580> me<00:07:27.790> to<00:07:27.880> land<00:07:28.090> before

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
eight now it waits for me to land before

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.800 
eight now it waits for me to land before
I<00:07:28.480> jump<00:07:28.860> and<00:07:29.940> if<00:07:30.940> we<00:07:31.060> look<00:07:31.210> at<00:07:31.330> our<00:07:31.420> script

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
I jump and if we look at our script

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:38.130 
I jump and if we look at our script
we've<00:07:32.650> actually<00:07:34.500> gotten<00:07:35.500> it<00:07:35.590> down<00:07:35.770> to<00:07:37.140> 39

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140 
we've actually gotten it down to 39

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.520 
we've actually gotten it down to 39
lines<00:07:38.560> including<00:07:39.220> all<00:07:39.310> the<00:07:39.460> brackets<00:07:40.380> we<00:07:41.380> can

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
lines including all the brackets we can

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.280 
lines including all the brackets we can
actually<00:07:42.390> get<00:07:43.390> rid<00:07:43.450> of<00:07:43.540> that<00:07:43.690> as<00:07:43.840> well<00:07:44.020> and

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.290 
actually get rid of that as well and

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.560 
actually get rid of that as well and
actually<00:07:45.250> we<00:07:45.670> can<00:07:45.760> cut<00:07:45.970> this<00:07:46.090> down<00:07:46.270> even<00:07:46.540> more

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.570 
actually we can cut this down even more

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.410 
actually we can cut this down even more
by<00:07:46.840> getting<00:07:46.900> rid<00:07:47.260> of<00:07:47.320> this<00:07:47.610> function<00:07:48.610> make

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.420 
by getting rid of this function make

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.070 
by getting rid of this function make
that<00:07:49.660> 32<00:07:50.200> lines<00:07:50.710> of<00:07:50.890> code<00:07:51.570> one<00:07:52.570> last<00:07:52.810> time

that 32 lines of code one last time

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.380 
that 32 lines of code one last time
let's<00:07:53.410> build<00:07:53.680> and<00:07:53.950> now<00:07:54.940> we<00:07:55.000> have<00:07:55.270> our
