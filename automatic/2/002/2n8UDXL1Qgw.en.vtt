I've<00:00:29.019> been<00:00:29.109> doing<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.439> pretty<00:00:29.470> good<00:00:29.710> amount<00:00:29.920> of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
I've been doing a pretty good amount of

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.540 
I've been doing a pretty good amount of
research<00:00:30.369> so<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.820> I<00:00:30.850> don't<00:00:30.970> mess<00:00:31.779> this<00:00:32.110> up<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
research so that I don't mess this up so

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.080 
research so that I don't mess this up so
one<00:00:34.059> of<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.269> things<00:00:34.480> that<00:00:35.160> Sony<00:00:36.160> did<00:00:36.580> now<00:00:36.790> was

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
one of the things that Sony did now was

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.960 
one of the things that Sony did now was
a<00:00:37.120> burst<00:00:37.629> mood<00:00:38.080> for<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:38.949> still<00:00:39.220> shots<00:00:39.519> so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
a burst mood for the still shots so

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.759 
a burst mood for the still shots so
you're<00:00:40.150> going<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.300> go<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.540> set<00:00:41.350> up<00:00:41.530> you're

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
you're going to go to set up you're

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.630 
you're going to go to set up you're
going<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:41.920> go<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.040> fps<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:45.309> three

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
going to go to fps so there's three

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.969 
going to go to fps so there's three
different<00:00:45.760> moods<00:00:46.210> what<00:00:46.989> they<00:00:47.140> mean<00:00:47.320> this<00:00:47.710> is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
different moods what they mean this is

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.860 
different moods what they mean this is
10<00:00:48.820> frames<00:00:49.210> per<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.690> second<00:00:50.670> five<00:00:51.670> frames<00:00:52.269> two

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
10 frames per one second five frames two

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.610 
10 frames per one second five frames two
seconds<00:00:53.909> two<00:00:54.909> frames<00:00:55.269> five<00:00:55.780> seconds

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.670 

so<00:01:00.310> I'm<00:01:00.700> going<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.090> set<00:01:01.420> 10<00:01:02.200> frames<00:01:02.590> per<00:01:02.800> second

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so I'm going to set 10 frames per second

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.900 
so I'm going to set 10 frames per second
then<00:01:05.680> we<00:01:05.770> go<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> my<00:01:06.070> photo<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.400> still<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.530> my

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
then we go to my photo I still have my

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.340 
then we go to my photo I still have my
timer<00:01:09.910> on<00:01:10.210> there<00:01:10.390> as<00:01:10.479> well<00:01:10.510> so<00:01:10.780> it's<00:01:11.170> going<00:01:11.260> to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
timer on there as well so it's going to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.340 
timer on there as well so it's going to
be<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.470> ten-second<00:01:12.220> timer<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.930> now<00:01:14.050> I<00:01:14.080> hit<00:01:14.260> the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
be a ten-second timer so now I hit the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.960 
be a ten-second timer so now I hit the
button<00:01:14.470> that's<00:01:14.740> on<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.890> count<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.220> 10<00:01:15.580> it's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
button that's on the count to 10 it's

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.690 
button that's on the count to 10 it's
going<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.180> take<00:01:16.390> 10<00:01:17.290> shots<00:01:17.740> for<00:01:18.250> each<00:01:18.340> burst

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
going to take 10 shots for each burst

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.330 
going to take 10 shots for each burst
mode<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.119> 10<00:01:19.390> shots<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.250> my<00:01:22.150> understanding<00:01:22.270> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
mode is 10 shots so my understanding is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.290 
mode is 10 shots so my understanding is
that<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:25.350> 10<00:01:26.350> frames<00:01:26.800> 1<00:01:27.610> second<00:01:28.090> is<00:01:28.150> going<00:01:28.210> to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
that the 10 frames 1 second is going to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.630 
that the 10 frames 1 second is going to
have<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.510> lowest<00:01:28.780> resolution<00:01:29.520> followed<00:01:30.520> by

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
have the lowest resolution followed by

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.870 
have the lowest resolution followed by
the<00:01:31.300> 5<00:01:31.600> 2<00:01:32.320> seconds<00:01:32.830> is<00:01:32.890> going<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.190> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
the 5 2 seconds is going to have the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.420 
the 5 2 seconds is going to have the
next<00:01:34.210> lowest<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.810> then<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.470> best<00:01:35.740> resolution

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
next lowest and then the best resolution

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.310 
next lowest and then the best resolution
is<00:01:36.670> going<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:37.030> be<00:01:37.180> 2<00:01:37.630> frames

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
is going to be 2 frames

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.530 
is going to be 2 frames
5<00:01:39.160> seconds<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> burst<00:01:42.399> mode<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.970> supposed<00:01:43.420> to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
5 seconds so burst mode is supposed to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.730 
5 seconds so burst mode is supposed to
be<00:01:43.630> used<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.200> use<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.530> for<00:01:44.619> like

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
be used you can use it for like

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.700 
be used you can use it for like
self-portraits<00:01:45.670> but<00:01:46.300> it'll<00:01:46.690> take<00:01:46.869> 10<00:01:47.229> shots

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
self-portraits but it'll take 10 shots

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.100 
self-portraits but it'll take 10 shots
and<00:01:48.190> then<00:01:48.940> it'll<00:01:49.180> catch<00:01:49.390> people<00:01:49.750> at<00:01:49.840> different

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and then it'll catch people at different

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.060 
and then it'll catch people at different
moments<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.649> can<00:01:50.680> go<00:01:50.830> through<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
kind of like action sequence that you're

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.840 
kind of like action sequence that you're
skateboarding<00:01:56.710> or<00:01:57.220> something<00:01:57.580> you're<00:01:57.759> going

skateboarding or something you're going
to<00:01:57.910> use<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.479> burst<00:01:58.750> mode<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.110> help<00:01:59.289> you<00:01:59.440> catch

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
to use the burst mode to help you catch

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.109 
to use the burst mode to help you catch
a<00:01:59.950> really<00:02:00.220> good<00:02:00.490> shot<00:02:02.550> I'm<00:02:03.550> going<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.850> go<00:02:03.910> back

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
a really good shot I'm going to go back

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.930 
a really good shot I'm going to go back
to<00:02:04.300> my<00:02:04.420> setup<00:02:04.750> again

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.880 

we're<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.660> go<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:12.020> I'm<00:02:12.590> going<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.770> do

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
we're going to go to I'm going to do

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.430 
we're going to go to I'm going to do
this<00:02:13.040> one

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.510 

you<00:02:19.440> see<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.740> one's<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> little

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you see this one's going to go a little

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.860 
you see this one's going to go a little
bit<00:02:20.730> slower<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> take<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
bit slower it's going to take the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:34.820 
bit slower it's going to take the
pictures<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> different<00:02:23.070> intervals<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.620> see

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
pictures and different intervals you see

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.350 
pictures and different intervals you see
and<00:02:35.010> then<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.220> does<00:02:35.400> take<00:02:35.610> some<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.150> write

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and then it does take some time to write

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.730 
and then it does take some time to write
to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.690> memory<00:02:36.960> card<00:02:36.990> as<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.410> see<00:02:37.620> it's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
to the memory card as you see it's

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.250 
to the memory card as you see it's
waiting<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> feature<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.780> does

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
waiting so this is a feature that does

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
waiting so this is a feature that does
take<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> couple<00:02:40.770> seconds<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> write<00:02:41.490> it's<00:02:41.760> not

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
take a couple seconds to write it's not

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.140 
take a couple seconds to write it's not
right<00:02:42.900> away

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
right away

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.930 
right away
so<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:46.140> very<00:02:47.100> good<00:02:47.340> feature<00:02:47.580> this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
so this is on a very good feature this

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.600 
so this is on a very good feature this
is<00:02:48.000> probably<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:49.070> second<00:02:50.070> favorite<00:02:50.370> feature

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
is probably my second favorite feature

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.860 
is probably my second favorite feature

little tutorial so you know how to set

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.870 
little tutorial so you know how to set
up<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:31.230> different<00:03:31.740> first<00:03:32.490> shot<00:03:32.730> modes<00:03:34.880> let's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
up the different first shot modes let's

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.980 
up the different first shot modes let's
go<00:03:36.060> again<00:03:36.330> I'm<00:03:36.780> gonna<00:03:36.960> get<00:03:37.050> my<00:03:37.170> setup<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.840> then

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
go again I'm gonna get my setup and then

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.290 
go again I'm gonna get my setup and then
I<00:03:40.110> go<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.940> FPS<00:03:43.010> will<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.310> five

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
I go to FPS will do the five

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.340 
I go to FPS will do the five
so<00:03:46.900> for<00:03:47.110> each<00:03:47.200> one<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.620> does<00:03:47.770> take<00:03:47.980> 10<00:03:48.250> photos

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
so for each one it does take 10 photos

and I really do like the self-timer so
together<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.840> self-timer<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.590> burst

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
together the self-timer in the burst

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.490 
together the self-timer in the burst
shot<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.880> really<00:03:55.270> cool<00:03:55.480> feature<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.990> kind<00:03:56.410> of
