00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
thought he was going to jump down and

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.900 
thought he was going to jump down and
hit<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.469> off<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.649> camera<00:00:44.800> off<00:00:45.039> so<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.700> hope

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
looks in here it's just such a pretty

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.800 
looks in here it's just such a pretty
color<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> coral<00:02:47.010> peachy<00:02:47.700> color<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
color like a coral peachy color so I

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.900 
color like a coral peachy color so I
think<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.470> really<00:02:49.710> nice<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.640> this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
think it's really nice so I think this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.610 
think it's really nice so I think this
is<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.390> nice<00:02:57.540> color<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:58.080> has<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.410> same

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
is a really nice color it has the same

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
is a really nice color it has the same
scent<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.370> taste<00:02:59.520> as<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.940> other<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:00.360> so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
scent and taste as the other one so

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.670 
scent and taste as the other one so
they're<00:03:00.690> probably<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:01.140> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
they're probably all going to be that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.060 
they're probably all going to be that
way

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
way

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.030 
way

chapped like I feel like I needed to put

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.260 
chapped like I feel like I needed to put
something<00:03:34.200> else<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.620> first<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:36.000> put

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
something else on first and then put

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.990 
something else on first and then put
this<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.560> didn't<00:03:38.459> want<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
this on but I didn't want to do that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
this on but I didn't want to do that
because<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.540> said<00:03:39.720> they're<00:03:39.810> medicated<00:03:40.380> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
because it said they're medicated I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.870 
because it said they're medicated I
wanted<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.740> see<00:03:40.920> how<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.190> work<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.850> think

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
wanted to see how they work but I think

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.940 
wanted to see how they work but I think
this<00:03:42.240> one<00:03:42.450> especially<00:03:42.900> accentuates<00:03:43.770> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
this one especially accentuates the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.190 
this one especially accentuates the
dryness<00:03:44.400> because<00:03:44.550> it's<00:03:45.300> such<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> light<00:03:45.930> color

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
dryness because it's such a light color

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.310 
dryness because it's such a light color
and<00:03:46.620> stuff<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.370> let<00:03:47.970> me<00:03:48.060> try<00:03:48.240> some<00:03:48.720> more<00:03:48.930> but

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
and stuff so let me try some more but

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.110 
and stuff so let me try some more but
yeah<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:50.130> actually<00:03:50.550> won't<00:03:50.700> stop<00:03:50.940> me<00:03:51.090> from

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
yeah that actually won't stop me from

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.150 
yeah that actually won't stop me from
wearing<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.720> because<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.230> really<00:03:52.590> do<00:03:52.800> like<00:03:52.980> this

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
wearing it because I really do like this

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.790 
wearing it because I really do like this
color<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.760> especially<00:03:54.660> maybe<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.530> time

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
color and especially maybe over time

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.949 
color and especially maybe over time
since<00:03:56.580> its<00:03:56.790> medicated<00:03:57.420> then<00:03:57.660> they<00:03:57.810> would

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
since its medicated then they would

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.630 
since its medicated then they would
start<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.350> heal<00:03:58.530> up<00:03:58.740> and<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.070> better<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.610> I

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
start to heal up and get better so I

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.220 
start to heal up and get better so I
guess<00:03:59.880> I'll<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.510> next<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:01.050> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
guess I'll have to see next one is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.590 
guess I'll have to see next one is
called<00:04:01.410> soothing<00:04:02.040> sorbet<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.209> like<00:04:03.420> how

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
called soothing sorbet and I like how

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:15.540 
called soothing sorbet and I like how
this<00:04:03.750> looks<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.510> let's<00:04:06.510> put<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.900> on

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.360 

so<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.900> went<00:04:17.140> on<00:04:17.230> so<00:04:17.530> much<00:04:17.709> better<00:04:18.070> I

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
so this one went on so much better I

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.620 
so this one went on so much better I
don't<00:04:18.430> know<00:04:18.580> what's<00:04:18.730> up<00:04:18.850> with<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.090> formula<00:04:19.420> of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
don't know what's up with the formula of

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.449 
don't know what's up with the formula of
that<00:04:19.780> other<00:04:19.959> one<00:04:20.200> because<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.950> was<00:04:21.190> like

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
that other one because it was like

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.610 
that other one because it was like
making<00:04:22.270> my<00:04:22.390> lips<00:04:22.540> worse<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:23.410> one

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
making my lips worse but this one

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.350 
making my lips worse but this one
actually<00:04:23.770> feels<00:04:24.280> nice<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.790> went<00:04:24.940> on<00:04:25.030> smooth

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
actually feels nice it went on smooth

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.660 
actually feels nice it went on smooth
and<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:26.680> this<00:04:26.890> color<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.250> think<00:04:27.340> it's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
and I do like this color I think it's

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.290 
and I do like this color I think it's
really<00:04:27.820> pretty

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
really pretty

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.780 
really pretty
it's<00:04:28.540> just<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.500> kind<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> pinky<00:04:30.550> red

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
it's just like kind of like a pinky red

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.300 
it's just like kind of like a pinky red
color<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.360> one<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.600> called<00:04:31.900> berry<00:04:32.380> soft<00:04:32.860> and

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
color this one is called berry soft and

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.580 
color this one is called berry soft and
it<00:04:33.910> does<00:04:34.090> look<00:04:34.330> really<00:04:34.540> nice<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:34.930> here<00:04:35.170> just

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it does look really nice in here just

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.470 
it does look really nice in here just
something<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.250> really<00:04:36.520> natural<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.390> you

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
something like really natural that you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.700 
something like really natural that you
could<00:04:37.690> wear<00:04:37.900> oh<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:43.810> is<00:04:43.960> not<00:04:44.290> how<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.530> expected

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
could wear oh this is not how I expected

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.830 
could wear oh this is not how I expected
it<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.280> go<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:45.790> now<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.150> look<00:04:46.390> at<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.720> it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
it to go on but now that I look at it it

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.110 
it to go on but now that I look at it it
does<00:04:47.050> look<00:04:47.320> like<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.710> for<00:04:48.670> some<00:04:48.820> reason<00:04:48.850> I

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
does look like this for some reason I

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.580 
does look like this for some reason I
think<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.450> name<00:04:49.660> threw<00:04:49.900> me<00:04:50.050> off<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.350> thought<00:04:50.500> it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
think the name threw me off I thought it

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.200 
think the name threw me off I thought it
was<00:04:50.680> just<00:04:50.770> gonna<00:04:50.980> be<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.490> berry<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.150> a

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
was just gonna be like a berry like a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.270 
was just gonna be like a berry like a
reddish<00:04:52.660> or<00:04:52.840> something<00:04:53.230> but<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.920> doesn't<00:04:54.220> even

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
reddish or something but it doesn't even

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.010 
reddish or something but it doesn't even
look<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.880> here<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.270> think<00:04:55.600> this<00:04:55.870> is

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
look like that in here I think this is

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.690 
look like that in here I think this is
such<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.290> pretty<00:04:56.560> color<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.950> really<00:04:57.040> like<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.580> it

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
such a pretty color I really like it it

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.820 
such a pretty color I really like it it
has<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:57.910> hint<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.510> purple<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.440> pinkish

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
has that hint of purple and the pinkish

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.860 
has that hint of purple and the pinkish
shade<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.610> think<00:05:00.910> it's<00:05:01.360> really<00:05:01.570> pretty<00:05:01.720> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
shade and I think it's really pretty and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.980 
shade and I think it's really pretty and
this<00:05:02.170> also<00:05:02.590> went<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.890> lot<00:05:03.130> better<00:05:03.340> than<00:05:03.490> that

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
this also went on a lot better than that

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.840 
this also went on a lot better than that
peachy<00:05:04.990> one<00:05:05.170> so<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.530> got<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.100> clear<00:05:06.340> one<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.610> lot

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
peachy one so I got the clear one a lot

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.430 
peachy one so I got the clear one a lot
of<00:05:06.970> times<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.300> don't<00:05:07.510> get<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.810> clear<00:05:07.990> ones<00:05:08.200> but

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
of times I don't get the clear ones but

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960 
of times I don't get the clear ones but
I<00:05:08.470> thought<00:05:08.740> oh<00:05:08.950> what<00:05:09.190> if<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.430> has<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.610> really

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
I thought oh what if it has a really

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.910 
I thought oh what if it has a really
good<00:05:10.120> scent<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.630> well<00:05:11.350> little<00:05:11.680> did<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.890> know

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
good scent to it well little did I know

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.250 
good scent to it well little did I know
none<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.550> them<00:05:12.700> are<00:05:12.910> scented<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.870> nice<00:05:14.050> way

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
none of them are scented in a nice way

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.010 
none of them are scented in a nice way
so<00:05:14.320> this<00:05:15.160> one<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.550> called<00:05:15.760> too<00:05:16.120> cool<00:05:16.480> and<00:05:16.870> it's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so this one is called too cool and it's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.360 
so this one is called too cool and it's
probably<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.590> going<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.770> be<00:05:17.920> a<00:05:17.950> clear

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
probably just going to be a clear

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.140 
probably just going to be a clear
version<00:05:18.640> of<00:05:18.940> these<00:05:19.470> yeah<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.680> smells<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.100> same

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.360 

actually<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.330> one<00:05:25.510> feels<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:26.020> little<00:05:26.140> better

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
actually this one feels a little better

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.010 
actually this one feels a little better
probably<00:05:27.370> without<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.940> all<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.360> coloring

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
probably without like all the coloring

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.200 
probably without like all the coloring
to<00:05:29.230> it<00:05:29.260> they<00:05:29.560> could<00:05:29.830> just<00:05:30.010> be<00:05:30.190> in<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.790> more<00:05:30.970> pure

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
to it they could just be in a more pure

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.780 
to it they could just be in a more pure
form<00:05:31.240> so<00:05:31.810> overall<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.500> actually<00:05:32.830> love<00:05:33.490> these

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
form so overall I actually love these

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.850 
form so overall I actually love these
colors<00:05:34.090> I'm<00:05:34.570> some<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.230> them<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.470> like<00:05:35.620> better

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
colors I'm some of them I like better

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.890 
colors I'm some of them I like better
than<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.220> original<00:05:36.820> baby<00:05:37.030> lips<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.720> baby

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
than the original baby lips and the baby

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.840 
than the original baby lips and the baby
lips<00:05:38.140> electro<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:39.010> all<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.250> other<00:05:39.400> ones<00:05:39.640> in

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
lips electro and all the other ones in

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.850 
lips electro and all the other ones in
between<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.450> really<00:05:41.050> do<00:05:41.200> think<00:05:41.410> there's<00:05:41.680> some

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
between I really do think there's some

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.010 
between I really do think there's some
really<00:05:42.190> pretty<00:05:42.520> colors<00:05:42.910> in<00:05:43.120> here<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.600> that's

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
really pretty colors in here so that's

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.560 
really pretty colors in here so that's
it<00:05:44.200> for<00:05:44.320> my<00:05:44.470> review<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:45.280> overall<00:05:46.060> most<00:05:46.360> of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
it for my review and overall most of

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.240 
it for my review and overall most of
them<00:05:46.690> do<00:05:46.900> feel<00:05:47.170> a<00:05:47.200> nice<00:05:47.410> on<00:05:47.680> there<00:05:48.130> was<00:05:48.220> just

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
them do feel a nice on there was just

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.640 
them do feel a nice on there was just
that<00:05:48.730> peach<00:05:49.330> one<00:05:49.540> I<00:05:49.570> think<00:05:49.720> was<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.020> worst<00:05:50.350> one

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
that peach one I think was the worst one

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.320 
that peach one I think was the worst one
and<00:05:50.980> then<00:05:51.100> they<00:05:51.310> seemed<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.730> get<00:05:51.850> better<00:05:52.090> and

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
and then they seemed to get better and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.940 
and then they seemed to get better and
better<00:05:52.450> and<00:05:52.780> then<00:05:52.930> with<00:05:53.110> the<00:05:53.200> clear<00:05:53.470> one<00:05:53.680> that

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
better and then with the clear one that

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.250 
better and then with the clear one that
just<00:05:54.130> topped<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.520> all<00:05:54.610> off<00:05:54.640> so<00:05:55.120> that's<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:56.080> hope

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
just topped it all off so that's it hope

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.570 
just topped it all off so that's it hope
that<00:05:56.410> you<00:05:56.500> enjoyed<00:05:56.860> seeing<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.250> colors
