00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.410
 another video for our channel 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.849
 offers gaming and that is now the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.809
 next part of me explain things the 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.120
 her sooner and how much learned and 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.780
 learning new in fifa 14 is short as 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.520
 the whole thing was jdf 14 nm and today 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.260
 it's about the gate and for it 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.030
 We look directly at a scene like 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.530
 before 13, where we move with balotelli 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.510
 you can shoot something on the goal 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.220
 It's really great the whole trees 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.450
 but again analyze it more closely and we 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.190
 want to pay attention to two things namely 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.780
 on the one hand, the run respectively 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.730
 Viewing direction of balotelli and this 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.890
 here on the short post or on the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.720
 short corner and then on the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.520
 Final shot direction and we 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.170
 shoot at the long corner and that 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.820
 was not in iced for two reasons 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.590
 really the best choice namely for 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.300
 it was just like that 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.800
 shot on the short corner resp 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.180
 Vollspannschuss on the short corner yes 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 he was a bit over powered 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.310
 was too strong only too often pure 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.750
 went 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.730
 That's why we want to stay here 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.410
 do not care but we want it 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.210
 take care of that, so to speak, then here 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.369
 another direction is like the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.560
 Running or viewing direction of balotelli 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.649
 and that has been a matter of someone 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.299
 413 should avoid because so often the 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.039
 shot came to us is easy 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.079
 so it's easier for the protect 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.689
 if he shoots the same direction as 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.130
 he also just runs or looks and that 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.509
 has then often led to the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.979
 Committees have become unplaced 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.659
 then we see as well as here the shot 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 comes and he comes very central 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.889
 today can hold him and so became one 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.450
 Good chances awarded and the problem 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.979
 see more examples 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.359
 there is then usually giving us the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.369
 short corner look in the long corner 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.600
 always shoot a deviation quasi 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.639
 between shot direction and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.869
 direction and then it has like 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.279
 I often feel like doing that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.079
 was held or he too and suddenly 

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:44.420
 has come and also next to the gate 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.099
 gone by or should therefore 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.959
 to do that in fifa 13 differently 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.329
 Either you direct the player differently 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.319
 before you look better or you have 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.659
 just shot on the short corner 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.959
 and that's a fifa 14 now 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.189
 bit different in those here 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.329
 you can be very successful now 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.189
 if you are in the long corner, for example 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.689
 although the player completes one 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.939
 looking in the short corner has 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.700
 there are probably two green ones for that 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.079
 namely, on the one hand , that meant that 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.849
 now the player more graduation 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.490
 has animations and some full to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.650
 for example, that he is the ball very easily 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 although lets slip over the spine and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.010
 This gets him in his light 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.990
 Australian and through the revised 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.730
 ball physics, it is then also so that the 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.100
 ball then really a trajectory 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.810
 where he then easily takes to the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.190
 teuto turns around in the long corner 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.380
 Shots come then just here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.060
 better placed and that's how you are then 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.650
 even with this variant home to quasi 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.840
 another shot direction than 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.420
 Viewing direction then chooses more successful 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.450
 and so it is more common in fifa 14 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.640
 a good option so we complete 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.020
 gaming now has the task 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.420
 the next days weeks and months 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.370
 find out exactly what it depends on 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.440
 When is which variant more successful 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 is or more promising and that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.220
 would then try to work out and 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.810
 to present you in a tutorial 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.640
 So there will be something like this where we are 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.990
 then explain when to go in the direction 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840
 you should shoot the one you are currently running 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.040
 one should deviate from it and for that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140
 we have to say easy as synonymous 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.340
 to experiment a little and yourself 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.450
 Of course, that could happen first 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.670
 let's do it you have to just here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.690
 experience generates this video 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.070
 should definitely first on 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.840
 make you aware that you are here now 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.130
 can also vary more so you have to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.600
 no longer dull just not 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.610
 shoot direction in which you are now 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.530
 or no one is watching 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.810
 it should have been for today from www 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.190
 dfg jdf 14 nm 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.840
 I hope you enjoyed it and you 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.520
 stay tuned for the next follow can 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.750
 happy suggestions in the comments 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.050
 do what we are going to do next 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.970
 should 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.360
 that's it from me half box 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 clean has beautiful here you can 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.540
 slowly purely also look out again 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.850
 call the deeper you are now, so to speak 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.180
 the purest the faster it runs 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.180
 player
