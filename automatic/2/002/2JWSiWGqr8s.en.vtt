00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
this is a book that I just read called

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.700 
this is a book that I just read called
barefoot<00:00:08.400> running<00:00:08.550> simple<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.780> I've<00:00:10.500> been

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
barefoot running simple and I've been

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
barefoot running simple and I've been
doing<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.340> about<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.580> year<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.480> reason<00:00:12.780> I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
doing it for about a year the reason I

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.860 
doing it for about a year the reason I
started<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.410> because<00:00:14.000> two<00:00:15.000> reasons<00:00:15.389> when<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
started is because two reasons when I

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.300 
started is because two reasons when I
saw<00:00:16.170> some<00:00:16.320> crazy<00:00:16.470> people<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.859> my<00:00:16.949> neighborhood

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
saw some crazy people in my neighborhood

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.130 
saw some crazy people in my neighborhood
doing<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.570> thought<00:00:18.750> look<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:18.990> those

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
doing it and I thought look at those

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.109 
doing it and I thought look at those
crazy<00:00:19.350> people<00:00:19.529> running<00:00:19.680> barefoot<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.760> the

crazy people running barefoot and the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.200 
crazy people running barefoot and the
other<00:00:21.270> reason<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.680> hurt<00:00:22.980> myself

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
other reason is because I hurt myself

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.950 
other reason is because I hurt myself

some good stuff in here but let me say
there<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.010> some<00:02:22.220> pseudoscience<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.240> here<00:02:23.680> for

there is some pseudoscience in here for

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.090 
there is some pseudoscience in here for
example<00:02:25.150> these<00:02:26.150> guys<00:02:26.390> say<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:29.450> running

so<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.940> read<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.079> they<00:03:24.890> got<00:03:25.190> they<00:03:25.400> also

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
so I read this and they got they also

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.160 
so I read this and they got they also
recommend<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.209> know<00:03:26.329> you<00:03:26.390> stand<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:26.989> some

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
recommend you know you stand on some

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.050 
recommend you know you stand on some
kind<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.440> freaking<00:03:27.739> charge<00:03:28.040> mat<00:03:28.459> or<00:03:28.730> something

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
kind of freaking charge mat or something

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.590 
kind of freaking charge mat or something

so<00:03:41.630> I<00:03:41.660> think<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.440> concept<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.890> grounding

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
so I think this concept of grounding

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.229 
so I think this concept of grounding
yourself<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> earth

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
yourself to the earth

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.370 
yourself to the earth
now<00:03:44.420> dezerter's<00:03:44.840> in<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.989> back<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.260> you're

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
now dezerter's in the back that you're

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
now dezerter's in the back that you're
touching<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.980> ground<00:03:46.160> all<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.310> time

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
touching the ground all the time

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.330 
touching the ground all the time
touching<00:03:46.820> grounded<00:03:47.480> things<00:03:48.340> seems

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
touching grounded things seems

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.220 
touching grounded things seems
ridiculous<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.299> then<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.810> idea<00:03:51.140> that

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
ridiculous and then this idea that

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.110 
ridiculous and then this idea that
there's<00:03:51.410> some<00:03:51.620> sort<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.860> resonance<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.640> that

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
there's some sort of resonance and that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.819 
there's some sort of resonance and that
they<00:03:53.269> they're<00:03:53.660> putting<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.320> ships

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
they they're putting it on ships

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.550 
they they're putting it on ships
spaceships<00:03:55.519> really<00:03:55.970> intrigued<00:03:56.360> me<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:57.200> I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
spaceships really intrigued me so I

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.920 
spaceships really intrigued me so I
googled<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.250> sure<00:03:59.209> enough<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.720> is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
googled it and sure enough this is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.590 
googled it and sure enough this is
completely<00:04:00.799> false<00:04:01.100> there<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:01.850> no<00:04:02.000> such<00:04:02.239> device

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
completely false there is no such device

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.480 
completely false there is no such device

in<00:04:22.380> short<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.920> would<00:04:23.130> say<00:04:23.460> run<00:04:24.030> barefoot<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:24.810> you

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
in short I would say run barefoot if you

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.710 
in short I would say run barefoot if you
would<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.220> rediscover<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:27.000> sort<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.570> a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
a different way to run because it's more

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.810 
energy conserving and finally run
barefoot<00:04:46.590> just<00:04:46.800> because<00:04:47.040> it's<00:04:47.190> absolutely

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
barefoot just because it's absolutely

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940

money<00:04:53.250> on<00:04:53.340> running<00:04:53.670> shoes<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.650> don't<00:04:55.650> run

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
money on running shoes but don't run

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.740 
money on running shoes but don't run
barefoot<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.640> grind<00:04:57.030> yourself<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.600> earth

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
barefoot to grind yourself to the earth

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.860 
barefoot to grind yourself to the earth
or<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.220> your<00:04:59.370> body<00:04:59.550> doesn't<00:04:59.870> implode

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
or so that your body doesn't implode

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.560 
or so that your body doesn't implode
like<00:05:01.260> some<00:05:01.560> space<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:03.360> basically<00:05:05.570> because

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
like some space it's basically because

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.480 
like some space it's basically because
that's<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:08.090> pseudoscience<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:11.280> must

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
that's just pseudoscience so if you must

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.490 
that's just pseudoscience so if you must
buy<00:05:11.670> Vibrams<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.420> guess<00:05:12.720> go<00:05:13.110> ahead<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.350> buy

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
buy Vibrams I guess go ahead and buy

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.770 
buy Vibrams I guess go ahead and buy
rhymers<00:05:13.890> but<00:05:14.040> why<00:05:14.820> not<00:05:14.970> just<00:05:15.240> run<00:05:15.390> barefoot

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
rhymers but why not just run barefoot

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.770 
rhymers but why not just run barefoot
and<00:05:16.310> enjoy<00:05:17.310> life<00:05:17.580> don't<00:05:17.940> hurt<00:05:18.060> yourself<00:05:18.360> put
