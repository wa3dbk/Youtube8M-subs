00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.380
 a 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.350
 while eight years ago when water came into effect was stopped 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.749
 Thursday in France with 5 points advanced 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.400
 it was midday of china build his house 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.150
 since that love story that has taken hold of him but a passion 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.510
 to take and we even did his job now professionals from the 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.119
 construction of straw houses he holds several workshops on this subject 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.590
 in the Seine he even wrote a first book build campaign and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.770
 working on his second vendee could talk hours it's a 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.430
 fair beast not to pay more the persistence of the capital where more 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 no area of ​​the plain of the orb to tell us about it 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.410
 still put a day where I fell more often by chance on a 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.160
 book on straw construction and beautiful photos 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.720
 and that I will buy 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.520
 it is out of respect to the possible and in fact we will live events accounts 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.600
 that I am quite possible and it's amazing it's really very 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.620
 very pleasant 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.830
 it's a very pretty and with an ecological advantage is clear that it seems 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.140
 easy enough to do 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 p the prevert 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.660
 I am with you 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.810
 so pretty took an advantage but 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810
 I might not be able to afford it 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.590
 for eight months 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.760
 but the advantage is that the two champagne slices or the use of 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.240
 straw boots in 2005 it's very demanding 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.729
 extremely isérois I do not know ours reproduced in sixth place for 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:28.660
 the same price 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.250
 % but that's easy to produce that device and it's a byproduct of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.780
 production from the outside him speak comfortable cereals are produced by 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 early and so cuttings all over the world and so is advised products 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.480
 very low-priced president of andra by basically putting these smugglers on it allows 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.860
 to undo base of two buildings oversees the% this meaning 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580
 there was surely more in the energy to produce the same 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.290
 approach by the survey products they consume no energy 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.490
 to later isolate the house so that's what I wanted to put the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.300
 straw what 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.870
 okay but the straw 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 d it's a big day for fires 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.590
 but they land in the facts that showed very well 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.560
 another one is in bulk but considering that we were nevertheless still 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.290
 size of a fake a bit in the yard i paid attention to a cleaning 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.119
 so once the wall is made it is coated are usually with the 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:33.180
 lime or a large victory but jean-guy land and suddenly there is more 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.339
 access for 100 euros fire directly on the dial which is the size so the 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.619
 paddocks 6th no cook patrick 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.619
 sastre who knows what comfort to the afp in vain 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.409
 do not be afraid of fire you see they will however 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.230
 the disadvantage of straw construction 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.870
 that's not a disadvantage because this concept I would tell you 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.729
 rather without weakness in the sense of its fragility 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.339
 to the fragility of building peace now 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.799
 besides any building that is too exposed to water it will first be 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.390
 wet and therefore badly but in the second time 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.730
 finally he also and the hero d they have but for this but I'm leaving 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.659
 the stone houses we had the tiles are removed from the front and they 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.340
 are not going to be 30 to 29 to 30 years old so for straw construction it's a bit 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.019
 the faster you have to pay more attention so design that protects 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.980
 well the walls% or put ko skidding eg wood siding this 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.370
 man very effective way if we can not afford to make it 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.520
 camps overflows month 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.219
 both roofs per year 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.370
 % so here we are paying more attention to water 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.750
 so if we prevent the water before entering the green but it will 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.849
 as eternal some concrete or another very long match and well 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.480
 finally a straw house is an advantage to sierre ecological insulation 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.249
 lyon to qualify 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:58.789
 I'm alone 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.789
 Sustainable development 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.709
 a record 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.599
 one she
