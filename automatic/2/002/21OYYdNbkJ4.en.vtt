00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:15.980
 and first we open the notebook and write 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:20.160
 this text should be placed here 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:29.490
 so that inside the window all is the name 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:39.390
 windows the name of the window we will have here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.760
