the<00:03:00.780> most<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> biggest<00:03:01.920> reactions

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the most you know the biggest reactions

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.670 
the most you know the biggest reactions
she<00:03:03.810> was<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.400> big<00:03:05.420> like<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.569> focal<00:03:07.260> points<00:03:07.650> of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
she was a big like the focal points of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.830 
she was a big like the focal points of
raw<00:03:08.159> for<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> while<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:09.030> she<00:03:09.209> became<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
raw for a while when she became the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.399 
raw for a while when she became the
general<00:03:10.200> manager<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:11.599> I<00:03:12.599> just<00:03:13.170> think<00:03:13.319> that's

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
general manager and I just think that's

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.290 
general manager and I just think that's
the<00:03:13.620> direction<00:03:13.860> you're<00:03:14.159> going<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.550> nej<00:03:15.060> as

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
the direction you're going in nej as

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.040 
the direction you're going in nej as
Divas<00:03:15.989> Champion<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:17.569> for<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:19.019> some

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
Divas Champion and for if for some

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.780 
Divas Champion and for if for some
reason<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.560> doesn't<00:03:19.769> take<00:03:20.069> place<00:03:20.099> at<00:03:20.580> payback

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
reason it doesn't take place at payback

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
reason it doesn't take place at payback
that<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.569> think<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.840> gonna<00:03:21.930> take<00:03:22.200> place<00:03:22.409> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that I think it's gonna take place and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.240 
that I think it's gonna take place and
rematch<00:03:23.040> may<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.340> out<00:03:23.519> money<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.970> bank<00:03:24.150> or

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
rematch may be out money to bank or

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.559 
rematch may be out money to bank or
maybe<00:03:26.250> even<00:03:26.370> summer<00:03:26.819> sign<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.180> honest<00:03:27.390> now

maybe even summer sign but honest now
honestly<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.049> don't<00:03:28.140> think<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.440> gonna<00:03:28.530> go

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
honestly I don't think it's gonna go

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.670 
honestly I don't think it's gonna go
that<00:03:29.519> far<00:03:29.879> where<00:03:30.239> AJ<00:03:30.810> wins<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.470> championship
