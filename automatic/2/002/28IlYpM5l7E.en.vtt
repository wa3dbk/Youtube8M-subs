00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.620 
bank if I still reply to elbow in here
and<00:05:50.170> you<00:05:51.170> see<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.590> finished<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:52.430> whole<00:05:52.670> test<00:05:53.330> I

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
and you see I finished the whole test I

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.450 
and you see I finished the whole test I
i<00:05:53.810> finished<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.500> testing<00:05:54.920> for<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.250> whole

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
i finished the testing for the whole

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.200 
i finished the testing for the whole
system<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:56.150> this<00:05:56.690> system<00:05:56.920> work<00:05:57.920> very<00:05:58.850> well

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
system and this system work very well

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.800 
system and this system work very well
perfectly<00:05:59.710> if<00:06:00.710> we<00:06:01.010> can<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.810> constant

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
perfectly if we can have a constant

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.520 
perfectly if we can have a constant
voltage<00:06:03.760> from<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.000> ordinator<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:06.020> check<00:06:06.320> into

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
voltage from the ordinator to check into

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.180 
voltage from the ordinator to check into
the<00:06:07.180> capacitor
