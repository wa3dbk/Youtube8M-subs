00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
here on them it gets a lot tighter here

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
here on them it gets a lot tighter here
and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> curve<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> sock

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and you see there's a curve to the sock

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
and you see there's a curve to the sock
and<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.640> cuz<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> fits<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.329> foot<00:00:54.780> really

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and that's cuz it fits your foot really

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.319 
and that's cuz it fits your foot really
tight<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.559> there's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> padding<00:00:57.120> here

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
tight and there's a lot of padding here

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.470 
tight and there's a lot of padding here
so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.579> nice<00:00:59.850> thick

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so you can see it's a really nice thick

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510 
so you can see it's a really nice thick
sock<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> guess<00:01:02.250> thinner

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
sock in here but then I guess thinner

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
sock in here but then I guess thinner
and<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.539> comfy<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.140> for<00:01:04.589> some

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and it's really comfy now for some

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.770 
and it's really comfy now for some
reason<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> pair<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
reason the pair I got they're out it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
reason the pair I got they're out it
usually<00:01:07.080> has<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.619> padding<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
usually has a lot more padding here a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
usually has a lot more padding here a
hex<00:01:08.790> pad<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> thing<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.350> gloves<00:01:10.619> but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
hex pad kind of thing like my gloves but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.260 
hex pad kind of thing like my gloves but
they<00:01:11.010> didn't<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> any<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:11.820> left<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
they didn't have any of those left so I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
they didn't have any of those left so I
just<00:01:12.420> got<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> cool

awesome<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.869> anything<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.469> them

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
awesome for really anything I use them

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.609 
awesome for really anything I use them
to<00:01:58.680> workout<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> use<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.509> football<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to workout I use them for football and I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.100 
to workout I use them for football and I
have<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.460> pair<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.780> feel<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
have the two pair because my feel that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.010 
have the two pair because my feel that
perhaps<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.799> muddy<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> use<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
perhaps not is really muddy so I use the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.240 
perhaps not is really muddy so I use the
black<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.619> doesn't<00:02:07.829> show<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.069> much

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
black one so it doesn't show that much

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440 
black one so it doesn't show that much
and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.610> leave<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.119> white<00:02:09.300> one

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.900 
and then I leave my white one
specifically<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.020> games<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> keep<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
on the left my left but this is how I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.229 
on the left my left but this is how I
wear<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.050> lock<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.590> my<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.150> how

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
wear this lock and my right this is how

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.759 
wear this lock and my right this is how
other<00:02:26.360> players<00:02:26.569> wear<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.989> socks<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.680> you

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
other players wear the socks so as you

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.559 
other players wear the socks so as you
can<00:02:27.890> see<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> sock<00:02:28.519> organ<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.420> should

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
can see with the sock organ I should

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.710 
can see with the sock organ I should
take<00:02:29.720> here<00:02:29.840> they<00:02:29.989> look<00:02:30.080> really<00:02:30.290> good<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
take here they look really good on the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.040 
take here they look really good on the
back<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:35.060> why<00:02:35.239> we're<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
back and so why we're like this on the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
back and so why we're like this on the
right<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.440> because<00:02:36.709> our<00:02:36.890> normal<00:02:37.040> sock<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.760> just

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
right is because our normal sock is just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
right is because our normal sock is just
white<00:02:38.239> solid<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.500> I'm<00:02:39.590> blue<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.099> like<00:02:40.250> to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
white solid and I'm blue so I like to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.890 
white solid and I'm blue so I like to
stick<00:02:40.549> with<00:02:40.700> our<00:02:40.790> team<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.180> some<00:02:41.390> players<00:02:41.720> do

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
stick with our team on some players do

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.199 
stick with our team on some players do

this the way they also try and stick

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.789 
this the way they also try and stick
with<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.599> they<00:02:44.750> take<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:46.160> like<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.370> Nike

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
with it is they take just like a Nike

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.180 
with it is they take just like a Nike
band<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.130> then<00:02:49.250> they<00:02:49.340> go<00:02:49.569> leg<00:02:50.569> band<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:52.040> that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
band and then they go leg band get that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.380 
band and then they go leg band get that
straight<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:52.700> any<00:02:52.790> matter<00:02:53.000> right<00:02:53.150> now

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
straight is there any matter right now

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.839 
straight is there any matter right now
but<00:02:55.150> something<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.340> little<00:02:58.489> leg

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
but something like that's a little leg

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.449 
but something like that's a little leg
band<00:02:59.060> on<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.420> make<00:02:59.569> it<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:01.099> that's<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> two

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
band on to make it and so that's the two

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.009 
band on to make it and so that's the two
looks<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.390> I'll<00:03:02.450> show<00:03:02.630> you<00:03:02.660> what<00:03:02.870> they

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
looks and so I'll show you what they

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.539 
looks and so I'll show you what they
look<00:03:03.049> like<00:03:03.200> what<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.220> little<00:03:04.430> message<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:06.549> so

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
look like what the little message now so

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.160 
look like what the little message now so
there's<00:03:07.700> what<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.940> message<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.569> as<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.049> can

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
there's what the message and as you can

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.979 
there's what the message and as you can
see<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:10.130> pretty<00:03:10.430> distorted<00:03:10.970> just<00:03:11.690> because<00:03:11.900> I

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
see it's pretty distorted just because I

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.229 
see it's pretty distorted just because I
have<00:03:12.140> really<00:03:12.380> big<00:03:12.560> calves<00:03:12.829> really<00:03:13.760> big<00:03:13.970> legs

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
have really big calves really big legs

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.330 
have really big calves really big legs
so<00:03:14.390> that's<00:03:14.569> why<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.989> don't<00:03:15.739> really<00:03:15.860> use<00:03:16.130> like

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
so that's why I don't really use like

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.720 
so that's why I don't really use like
that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
that

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.140 
that
so<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.750> looks<00:03:17.930> kind<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.230> dumb<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:19.340> lot<00:03:20.060> of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
so it looks kind of dumb but a lot of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.970 
so it looks kind of dumb but a lot of
kids<00:03:20.359> so<00:03:20.480> wear<00:03:20.750> these<00:03:20.900> socks<00:03:21.139> with<00:03:21.380> blue

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980
