00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.549
 is the teacher markarián and already knowing 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:10.579
 we are absolutely eliminated from this 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.650
 eliminatory how to face the next 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.259
 matches are those that remain of this 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.630
 competition will be located younger today 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.130
 they were carrillo portado that 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.769
 eventually they can be part of the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.259
 next process but we will continue to see 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.369
 suddenly new appearances for these 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.400
 two parties that suddenly already 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.310
 will play without the connotation of 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.720
 last games you know what I 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.620
 I said before I started 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.739
 eliminating everything that was a tournament 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.329
 I needed that in a group 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.290
 important 14 or 15 players 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.290
 they were always 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 we have done that until today 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.770
 however in one it seems to me that in a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 decision 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.840
 for which I congratulate myself we made a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.440
 young team started making games 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.180
 friendly and many of those young people who 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.470
 have stood out in those areas today and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.850
 are entering the selection 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 absolutely and surely 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.980
 they make up an important number that are going to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.380
 be the future of the selection of Peru 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.240
 but it seems a little premature to me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.570
 I answered that I'm going to do the matches 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 With Argentina in Bolivia, I'm going 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.100
 to consider surely will be in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.540
 my consideration but I do not think that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.909
 there's no time for us to talk about that 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 still not 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 where will everyone 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.630
 before starting today's match 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.580
 we read in the Peruvian media that you 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.440
 I had made the decision not to continue 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.670
 Peru on the bench yet 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.900
 we also made a statement of the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.970
 president of the Peruvian federation 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.860
 Manuel Burga saying that he was very 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.960
 premature and that there was possibility of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.430
 understand what has been beyond 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.850
 talk apart from what the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.850
 elimination matches 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.390
 to see what is so important is a 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.440
 coach who does everything all a 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.240
 drama with these things 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.200
 about seven or eight months ago 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.780
 explain to your colleagues in Peru 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 what was my position regarding the future 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.099
 and against the offer that the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.099
 Peruvian operation was doing to me and I said 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.560
 and classified the world cup play the world 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.800
 and I would consider the possibility 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.040
 would consider the possibility of initiating 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.010
 a new cycle in which I would never direct 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.650
 I still say the same thing today with a 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.590
 difference no longer ranked the World Cup and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.200
 therefore my time after the last 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.700
 party with Bolivia ended or it is not 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.180
 nothing new or I'm not inventing 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.150
 nothing I did not say here nothing also says the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.400
 requirement and very clearly yes that no 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.959
 let's make a drama of this 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.959
 life in carabobeño city 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.120
 humberto turinés and watching television 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.480
 a night like this teacher already spoke 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.510
 of the theme of the collective functioning of 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.710
 venezuela what he thought today 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.950
 national team show 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.800
 of the country now some individuality that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.990
 consider you marked the party that was 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.800
 difficult to control and they did not have it 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.800
 maybe planned 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.450
 We did not know everyone because we already 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.970
 I had complicated enough in the cup 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 America 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.760
 martínez also seems to us a player 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.220
 super interesting in a lot of mobility is 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.810
 all known or there are no surprises 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.050
 yes i think it makes a big difference 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.650
 track display a dynamic in the 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.900
 divided were from venezuela 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.659
 so it's very park because there was the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.140
 difference I anyway have to 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.640
 congratulate my players that even being 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.159
 in some passages far exceeded 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.689
 They did their best to try to 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.689
 take the game forward 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.659
 last two questions I'm a member of the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.659
 my own 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.710
 -8 teacher seems a bit 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.150
 strange let's say I already explain a little 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.100
 that was the rapprochement but why 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.500
 will reserve warrior town so long 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.330
 if we say we played everything for everything 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.840
 and I had to put all the great meat 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.040
 flavor I would like an explanation about 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.950
 at the end of the game of 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.740
 past we had the decision made 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.420
 that even for tactical reasons if we go 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.150
 to play with only center forward 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.210
 I was doubt the press if the groups 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.250
 we transmitted was one or the other and we knew 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.250
 that neither of them was going to play 90 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.840
 minutes because they would not support the 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.550
 so we decided to start by pizarro 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.290
 because he is the captain because it meant 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.570
 a representation inside the court 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.430
 important but knowing that in some 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.870
 moment I was going to decline in the effort and 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.640
 that the warrior was going to enter so 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.550
 the change was planned the only 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.730
 change in schedule after the 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.770
 Herrera's injury that forced 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.920
 the other change will also enter the line 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.630
 the result 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.940
 with the thousands who had played the 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.950
 previous match 2 was also 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.960
 expected that at some point it was going to 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.460
 producing the change we found that 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.680
 crossed was already 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.170
 very tired and we had to do the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.330
 sites were changes strictly by 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.620
 physical reasons all three the three 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.050
 changes for one for physical reasons 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.680
 last question 11 points behind the 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.680
 dotcom play 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.960
 good evening professor and for what 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.090
 change the equipment is already removed if 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520
 I had the opportunity to put a 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.290
 note to the selection during all this 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.290
 eliminator how much would you put 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.790
 and it's deficient that we have to 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.960
 to accept 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.940
 we had some good time 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.030
 but we are doing well in general all 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.280
 local matches 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.330
 and we did not play well at the visitor 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.330
 except the match with Bolivia 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.960
 in the pass with chile in chile we made a 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.870
 good match we tell you another result 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.360
 and out there no more than visitors we had 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.240
 a big deficit and especially not us 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.130
 the second match always cost a lot 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.840
 in the pair of games we did what 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.440
 possible to counter this that 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.720
 it seems already an ancient theme within 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.660
 the Peruvian national functions but 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.810
 good still floating as much as we have 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.300
 spent the front we have not got 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:06.090
 a good result we did not have tillage 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.419
 from producer only markarián shortly 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:13.340
 will be the teacher would be observed 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.340
 finally called the journalist
