00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.369
 of the story is the video and silly man 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.730
 gamer and I bring you a very nice boxing 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.380
 and very expected well many will know 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 because it says on twitter that this end 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.320
 I was going to spend the week with my girlfriend 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.899
 that she was going to come to my house and she 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.550
 brought a part in half of my 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.530
 Christmas gift because as in 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.660
 Christmas she returns to her home and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.309
 We are very far 3,000 kilometers away 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 two days then we are doing the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.469
 gifts this week and the next 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 then we are going to do the unboxing of the 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.390
 Friend of Kirby and the command adapter 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.719
 of liquids for nintendo wii 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.020
 ok let's start with the adapter 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.200
 let's go there I'll open it 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.170
 from behind tells us 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.610
 the parrots there four players at a time 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.199
 with an adapter of the gen knobs 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.740
 that it is possible to connect up to four 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.900
 controls 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.820
 if you use two adapters you can connect 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.460
 a total of eight hands simultaneously 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 but what I wonder if the water me 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.220
 It only has two usb ports and this takes up 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.530
 Two usb ports like connected cojones 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.300
 two adapters to see these needy 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.220
 you are going to have to buy 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.860
 a web controller must bet a 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.210
 concentrator of seve good says the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.979
 accessory are compatible with super 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.979
 smash bros pride does not work with others 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.450
 wii ni wii games thank you and the 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.330
 accessory connects wii console a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.800
 through two usb ports if it says so 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.020
 here if there were not two usb ports 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.150
 free you can use a multiplier of 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.040
 usb ports good what they've 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.810
 commented before here inside us 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.270
 we found the instruction pamphlet 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.550
 which measures approximately 400 kilometers 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.380
 and that I do not intend to deploy it at all 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.540
 because if I never do it again 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.659
 I will never get to leave it again 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.630
 in the place 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.420
 we keep looking inside 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.430
 from the box if we look cautiously 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 we can get this perfectly 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.090
 plasticized and well 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.709
 inside is the adapter 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.849
 and good as you see seen what 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.709
 happens that the lighting of the other 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.190
 camera is not the best thing in the world above 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.870
 We have the will you logo under good 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.450
 low front have four ports 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.760
 for command of gamecube here information 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.060
 optional and madness from behind 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 absolutely nothing and the eternal cable that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 has an output of two usb ports not 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.090
 I know why the state madness of putting 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.250
 one port of each color is not the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.530
 lighting let alone one is black 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.959
 and the other one is gray I do not know what madness is 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 this nintendo you are drunk and good 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.220
 but thanks to this you can play with me 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.810
 command gamecube to super smash bros and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 I did not charge the pro control it was 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.049
 that by the way so this case of what 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.239
 you told me the comments and he has 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.780
 revived and now we're going to have a boxing 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.879
 from Kirby's friend a very nice friend and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.819
 that will provide us hours and hours 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.620
 of fun well behind the typical 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.040
 picture of all friends in this case 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.040
 irving 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.370
 there we have it 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.860
 if you have not seen the boxes of my 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.940
 other friends I will leave the video in my 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 channel and you see it well we are going to 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.450
 explain it 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.440
 hello kirby 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.630
 to see if he wants to leave or this shy 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.670
 perfect the only thing for which the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.620
 Friends can not be used while being 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.450
 the box is for the piece of this silver 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.800
 that they put there under synoptics what is 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.000
 could show at least in mario kart 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.510
 because mario kart is at a distance 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 so the control takes them quietly what 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.030
 we open 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.230
 and we got it out then here is 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.230

 super funny is one of those who are 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.640
 better facts if we compare it with the 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.020
 others especially I think that both 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.690

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.880
