hi<00:00:02.490> folks<00:00:02.850> today<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.600> got<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.700> 2015<00:00:05.899> Yamaha

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
hi folks today we got a 2015 Yamaha

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:20.840 
hi folks today we got a 2015 Yamaha
Raptor<00:00:07.820> 700<00:00:08.820> our

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.880 

a<00:00:20.880> few<00:00:21.510> minor<00:00:22.370> updates<00:00:23.370> for<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:24.380> 15<00:00:25.380> model

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a few minor updates for the 15 model

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:39.000 
a few minor updates for the 15 model
over<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> 14

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.810 

I<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:40.480> it's<00:00:40.629> about<00:00:40.870> 10%<00:00:41.289> more<00:00:41.739> power<00:00:41.920> or<00:00:42.609> so

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
I think it's about 10% more power or so

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.670 
I think it's about 10% more power or so
at<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.980> Yamaha<00:00:44.980> extracted<00:00:45.850> from<00:00:46.680> redesigning

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
at the Yamaha extracted from redesigning

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.279 
at the Yamaha extracted from redesigning
the<00:00:47.920> camshaft<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:50.289> cylinder<00:00:50.829> head<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:53.140> have

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
the camshaft the cylinder head they have

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.609 
the camshaft the cylinder head they have
a<00:00:53.320> new<00:00:53.530> muffler<00:00:53.769> design<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.469> believe<00:00:56.469> they

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
a new muffler design and I believe they

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:04.439 
a new muffler design and I believe they
also<00:00:56.769> added<00:00:57.070> an<00:00:57.250> AI<00:00:57.549> system

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.370 

of<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.290> Yamaha<00:01:05.680> Baloo<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.689> this<00:01:11.080> blows

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
of that Yamaha Baloo but this blows

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.789 
of that Yamaha Baloo but this blows
power<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:12.100> know<00:01:13.200> surprisingly<00:01:14.200> gets<00:01:14.439> eight

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
power you know surprisingly gets eight

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.800 
power you know surprisingly gets eight
percent<00:01:15.280> better<00:01:15.430> fuel<00:01:15.580> economy<00:01:15.970> which<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:16.780> a

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
percent better fuel economy which is a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
percent better fuel economy which is a
little<00:01:17.049> bonus<00:01:18.689> turn<00:01:19.689> it<00:01:19.840> on<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:20.200> for<00:01:20.470> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.190 

it's<00:01:24.520> got<00:01:24.700> fuel<00:01:24.970> injection<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.049> just

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
it's got fuel injection so it just

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's got fuel injection so it just
starts<00:01:26.860> up<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.810> second<00:01:28.810> every<00:01:29.049> time<00:01:29.259> all<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
starts up in a second every time all the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:53.800 
starts up in a second every time all the
time

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.560 

Yamaha's<00:01:54.740> I'll<00:01:55.130> tweet<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.670> hailing<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.270> little

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
Yamaha's I'll tweet the hailing a little

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.620 
Yamaha's I'll tweet the hailing a little
I<00:01:56.689> believe<00:01:57.020> they<00:01:57.170> lengthen<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.180> rear<00:01:59.180> shock

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
I believe they lengthen the rear shock

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.460 
I believe they lengthen the rear shock
by<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.259> few<00:02:00.710> millimeters<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:02.200> little<00:02:03.200> tiny

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
by a few millimeters a little tiny

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.380 
by a few millimeters a little tiny
refinements<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.670> constantly<00:02:05.180> making

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
refinements that are constantly making

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:31.340 
refinements that are constantly making
this<00:02:06.460> machine<00:02:07.460> even<00:02:07.759> better<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.509> better

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.650 

this<00:02:32.010> year<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.430> well<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:32.970> pumped<00:02:33.360> up<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
this year as well they pumped up the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:44.220 
this year as well they pumped up the
tires<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.850> 22<00:02:35.850> inches<00:02:36.240> opposed<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.430> 21

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.880 

it's<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> reverse<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.550> as<00:02:45.670> well<00:02:46.890> sapling

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
it's got a reverse here as well sapling

00:02:47.890 --> 00:03:39.320 
it's got a reverse here as well sapling
comes<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.520> handy

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.650 

now<00:03:39.750> these<00:03:39.960> wrapped<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> really<00:03:41.660> wonderful

now these wrapped is a really wonderful

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
now these wrapped is a really wonderful
machine<00:03:43.440> they<00:03:43.680> got<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.100> looks

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
machine they got the looks

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.720 
machine they got the looks
huge<00:03:46.680> big<00:03:47.010> torque<00:03:48.860> awesome<00:03:49.860> solid<00:03:50.310> axle
