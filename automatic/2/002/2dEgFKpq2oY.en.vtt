00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
Xbox originally halo was supposed to be

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.619 
Xbox originally halo was supposed to be
like<00:00:52.559> Halo<00:00:52.770> Wars<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.309> top-down<00:00:53.910> strategy

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
like Halo Wars a top-down strategy

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
like Halo Wars a top-down strategy
realtime<00:00:55.410> strategy<00:00:55.500> shooter<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.760> was

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
realtime strategy shooter and it was

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
realtime strategy shooter and it was
supposed<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> mac<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.649> was

supposed to be on the mac and it was

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.040 
supposed to be on the mac and it was
supposed<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> prove<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.579> Mac<00:01:00.270> could<00:01:00.719> gain

supposed to prove that Mac could gain

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
supposed to prove that Mac could gain
because<00:01:01.379> Matt<00:01:02.190> Cain<00:01:02.489> games<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> lie

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because Matt Cain games that was a lie

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
which was pretty bad as in halo 3 which

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.940 
which was pretty bad as in halo 3 which
is<00:01:52.409> even<00:01:52.890> better<00:01:52.920> than<00:01:53.130> halo<00:01:53.369> 2<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.329> um<00:01:54.950> then

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is even better than halo 2 and um then

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399 
is even better than halo 2 and um then
it<00:01:56.159> fell<00:01:56.310> off<00:01:56.340> obviously<00:01:57.180> halo<00:01:57.450> ODST<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:58.229> not

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it fell off obviously halo ODST was not

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
it fell off obviously halo ODST was not
the<00:01:58.560> most<00:01:58.710> beloved<00:01:59.159> Halo<00:01:59.579> game<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the most beloved Halo game because I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.679 
the most beloved Halo game because I
mean<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> had<00:02:01.770> cool<00:02:02.040> story<00:02:02.579> player<00:02:02.909> aspect<00:02:03.479> but

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
mean it had cool story player aspect but

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.060 
mean it had cool story player aspect but
that<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.469> nothing<00:02:04.530> else<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that was it there was nothing else to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
that was it there was nothing else to
add<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.329> multiplayer<00:02:06.689> side<00:02:06.930> which<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
add to the multiplayer side which is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.470 
add to the multiplayer side which is
what<00:02:07.439> hey<00:02:07.560> people<00:02:07.860> were<00:02:07.920> playing<00:02:08.069> halo<00:02:08.399> 4<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
what hey people were playing halo 4 and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.360 
what hey people were playing halo 4 and
halo<00:02:11.480> reach<00:02:11.810> came<00:02:12.080> out<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:12.920> people<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
halo reach came out and then people the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.430 
halo reach came out and then people the
multiplayer<00:02:13.820> aspect<00:02:14.180> was<00:02:14.330> there<00:02:14.570> it's<00:02:15.230> just

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
multiplayer aspect was there it's just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.770 
multiplayer aspect was there it's just
it<00:02:15.650> wasn't<00:02:16.040> as<00:02:16.310> good<00:02:16.490> as<00:02:16.640> halo<00:02:16.820> 3<00:02:17.150> because<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it wasn't as good as halo 3 because it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.080 
it wasn't as good as halo 3 because it
wasn't<00:02:18.140> competitive<00:02:18.380> enough<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.130> plus<00:02:19.880> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
wasn't competitive enough and plus the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.460 
wasn't competitive enough and plus the
mechanics<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.600> they<00:02:20.780> put<00:02:20.960> into<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> game

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
mechanics that they put into the game

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.760 
mechanics that they put into the game
were<00:02:21.680> pretty<00:02:23.110> stupid<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.380> lot<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.680> people

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
were pretty stupid to a lot of people

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.730 
were pretty stupid to a lot of people
the<00:02:25.700> armor<00:02:26.030> lock<00:02:26.210> was<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:26.720> stupid<00:02:26.930> that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the armor lock was really stupid that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.380 
the armor lock was really stupid that
you<00:02:28.070> had<00:02:28.250> those<00:02:28.430> stupid<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.030> had<00:02:29.240> to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you had those stupid that you had to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.530 
you had those stupid that you had to
have<00:02:29.510> an<00:02:29.630> ability<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.530> run<00:02:31.090> which<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.270> stupid

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
have an ability to run which was stupid

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.980 
have an ability to run which was stupid
and<00:02:32.960> then<00:02:33.080> halo<00:02:33.320> 4<00:02:33.740> fell<00:02:33.980> off<00:02:34.160> um<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.540> it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
and then halo 4 fell off um because it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.500 
and then halo 4 fell off um because it
just<00:02:36.110> had<00:02:36.500> no<00:02:36.680> replayability<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.820> maps<00:02:38.120> were

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
just had no replayability the maps were

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.800 
just had no replayability the maps were
poorly<00:02:38.870> built<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.880> mechanics<00:02:41.390> were<00:02:41.510> okay<00:02:41.780> I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
poorly built the mechanics were okay I

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.840 
poorly built the mechanics were okay I
like<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.140> mechanics<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.070> graphics<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.730> my

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
like the mechanics the graphics in my

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.670 
like the mechanics the graphics in my
opinion<00:02:44.090> were<00:02:44.330> nowhere<00:02:44.720> near<00:02:45.200> as<00:02:45.350> good<00:02:45.380> as

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
opinion were nowhere near as good as

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.500 
opinion were nowhere near as good as
halo<00:02:45.860> reach<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.340> my<00:02:46.430> opinion<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:47.120> people<00:02:47.300> can

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
halo reach in my opinion now people can

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.170 
halo reach in my opinion now people can
say<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.720> halo<00:02:48.200> reach<00:02:48.470> was<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> bad<00:02:49.130> halo<00:02:49.580> but

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
say that halo reach was a bad halo but

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
say that halo reach was a bad halo but
if<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.390> if<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.290> back<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.860> if

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
if you if you really think back to it if

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.370 
if you if you really think back to it if
I<00:02:52.070> think<00:02:52.130> back<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.940> played<00:02:53.510> halo<00:02:53.750> reach<00:02:54.020> a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
I think back to it I played halo reach a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.330 
I think back to it I played halo reach a
lot<00:02:55.340> more<00:02:55.670> than<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:56.090> played<00:02:56.360> halo<00:02:56.840> 4<00:02:57.190> by<00:02:58.190> an

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
lot more than I played halo 4 by an

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.520 
lot more than I played halo 4 by an
exponential<00:02:59.270> amount<00:02:59.660> like<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.200> only<00:03:00.260> reason

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
exponential amount like the only reason

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.080 
exponential amount like the only reason
I<00:03:00.620> play<00:03:00.830> halo<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.280> because<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.520> wanted<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.910> get

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
I play halo is because I wanted to get

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.410 
I play halo is because I wanted to get
to<00:03:02.330> general<00:03:02.750> status<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:04.460> I<00:03:04.730> also<00:03:04.910> wanted<00:03:05.360> to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
to general status and I also wanted to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.510 
to general status and I also wanted to
unlock<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> certain<00:03:06.500> amo<00:03:06.800> because<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.220> get<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
unlock a certain amo because you get the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.430 
unlock a certain amo because you get the
armor<00:03:07.790> at<00:03:07.910> general<00:03:08.270> status<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.110> that's<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
armor at general status so that's the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.720 
armor at general status so that's the
only<00:03:09.560> reason<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.890> kept<00:03:10.100> playing<00:03:10.190> halo<00:03:10.550> reach

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
only reason I kept playing halo reach

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.340 
only reason I kept playing halo reach
and<00:03:10.970> once<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.240> got<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.930> stop<00:03:12.110> playing

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
and once I got that I just stop playing

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.460 
and once I got that I just stop playing
it<00:03:12.470> halo<00:03:13.010> 4<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.370> had<00:03:13.490> no<00:03:13.850> motivation<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.930> play

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it halo 4 and had no motivation to play

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
it halo 4 and had no motivation to play
all<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.890> was<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.459> running<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.360> kill

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
all it was is you running you kill

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.990 
all it was is you running you kill
people<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:18.200> there<00:03:18.410> was<00:03:18.530> no<00:03:19.000> competitive

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
people like there was no competitive

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.640 
people like there was no competitive
skill<00:03:20.270> ranking<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.780> mean<00:03:20.930> they<00:03:21.020> added<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.440> later

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
skill ranking I mean they added it later

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.130 
skill ranking I mean they added it later
on<00:03:21.739> but<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.850> had<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.060> actually<00:03:23.300> log<00:03:23.780> into<00:03:24.110> a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
on but you had to actually log into a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.380 
on but you had to actually log into a
website<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.950> look<00:03:25.520> up<00:03:25.730> your<00:03:25.910> competitive

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
website and look up your competitive

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.790 
website and look up your competitive
school<00:03:26.570> ranking<00:03:26.959> which<00:03:27.170> defeats<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.770> whole

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
school ranking which defeats the whole

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.250 
school ranking which defeats the whole
purpose<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.430> skill<00:03:29.180> ranking<00:03:29.570> halo<00:03:29.810> 3<00:03:30.020> was<00:03:30.140> so

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
purpose of skill ranking halo 3 was so

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.710 
purpose of skill ranking halo 3 was so
amazing<00:03:30.680> because<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.760> ranking<00:03:32.239> system<00:03:32.540> was

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
amazing because the ranking system was

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.900 
amazing because the ranking system was
completely<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.860> trueskill<00:03:34.310> ranking<00:03:34.640> system

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
completely the trueskill ranking system

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.580

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and that's why halo 3 was so fucking

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.800 
and that's why halo 3 was so fucking
amazing<00:03:48.160> because<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.310> actually<00:03:49.600> proved<00:03:50.600> that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
longer but you could do it halo reach I

longer but you could do it halo reach I
mean<00:04:04.280> with<00:04:04.430> Halo<00:04:04.640> 3<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.900> couldn't<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.260> that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
mean with Halo 3 you couldn't do that

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.170 
mean with Halo 3 you couldn't do that
with<00:04:06.530> halo<00:04:06.680> 2<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.040> could<00:04:07.220> do<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.519> that's<00:04:07.970> why

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
with halo 2 you could do that that's why

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.610 
with halo 2 you could do that that's why

obviously with Halo Reach when you threw

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.980 
obviously with Halo Reach when you threw
a<00:04:36.830> grenade<00:04:36.980> on<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.340> ground<00:04:37.630> there<00:04:38.630> would<00:04:38.840> be<00:04:38.870> a

a grenade on the ground there would be a

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
spokes and sparkles and flames and then

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.040 
spokes and sparkles and flames and then
there<00:04:43.700> would<00:04:43.790> be<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.910> crater<00:04:44.330> left<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
there would be a crater left in the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.390 
there would be a crater left in the
ground<00:04:45.170> as<00:04:45.560> if<00:04:45.740> there<00:04:45.890> was<00:04:46.010> an<00:04:46.130> explosion

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
ground as if there was an explosion

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.780 
ground as if there was an explosion
there<00:04:46.820> when<00:04:47.240> halo<00:04:47.450> 4<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:48.290> get<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:49.070> grenade<00:04:49.640> in

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
there when halo 4 you get the grenade in

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.280 
there when halo 4 you get the grenade in
there<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.210> would<00:04:50.360> explode<00:04:50.750> there<00:04:51.110> would<00:04:51.200> be<00:04:51.230> a

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
there it would explode there would be a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.600 
there it would explode there would be a
little<00:04:51.470> bit<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.710> smoke<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.040> that's<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.430> there

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
little bit of smoke and that's it there

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.210 
little bit of smoke and that's it there
was<00:04:52.730> no<00:04:52.910> sparks<00:04:53.900> no<00:04:53.990> flames<00:04:54.110> no<00:04:54.740> electricity

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
was no sparks no flames no electricity

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.850 
was no sparks no flames no electricity
no<00:04:55.640> smoking<00:04:56.450> or<00:04:56.600> no<00:04:56.720> craters<00:04:57.290> in<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.440> floor<00:04:57.740> it

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
no smoking or no craters in the floor it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.200 
no smoking or no craters in the floor it
looks<00:04:58.100> like<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.400> was<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.730> brand<00:04:58.970> new<00:04:59.090> place

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
looks like it was just a brand new place

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.420 
looks like it was just a brand new place
that's<00:04:59.360> why<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.410> graphics<00:05:00.770> just<00:05:01.010> weren't<00:05:01.190> as

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
that's why the graphics just weren't as

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.210 
that's why the graphics just weren't as
good<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:02.030> was<00:05:02.150> just<00:05:02.330> overall<00:05:03.140> better<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.920> halo

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
good it was just overall better in halo

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.760 
good it was just overall better in halo
reach<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.700> graphics<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:06.050> maps<00:05:06.290> were<00:05:06.500> poorly

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
reach the graphics the maps were poorly

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.100

built<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.430> Halo<00:05:07.670> 4<00:05:08.030> obviously<00:05:08.450> they<00:05:08.570> went<00:05:08.810> they

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
built in Halo 4 obviously they went they

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.680 
built in Halo 4 obviously they went they
called<00:05:09.350> it<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.500> figure<00:05:09.980> 8<00:05:10.270> maps<00:05:11.270> where<00:05:11.540> they

called it the figure 8 maps where they

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.160 
called it the figure 8 maps where they
just<00:05:11.930> drew<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> figure<00:05:13.010> eight<00:05:13.250> like<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:15.020> whole

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
just drew a figure eight like the whole

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.360 
just drew a figure eight like the whole
match<00:05:15.350> were<00:05:15.500> designed<00:05:15.800> around<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.220> figure

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
match were designed around the figure

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.650 
match were designed around the figure
eight<00:05:16.640> I<00:05:16.820> don't<00:05:16.970> know<00:05:17.030> why<00:05:17.240> they<00:05:17.450> did<00:05:17.630> that

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
eight I don't know why they did that

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
eight I don't know why they did that
doubt<00:05:18.230> that<00:05:18.560> is<00:05:18.950> completely<00:05:19.310> uncompetitive

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
doubt that is completely uncompetitive

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.050 
doubt that is completely uncompetitive
obviously<00:05:21.680> in<00:05:21.800> Halo<00:05:21.950> 3<00:05:22.040> you<00:05:22.250> had<00:05:22.370> one<00:05:22.550> side<00:05:22.790> on

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
obviously in Halo 3 you had one side on

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.450 
obviously in Halo 3 you had one side on
that<00:05:23.330> each<00:05:24.200> of<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.560> spawn<00:05:24.860> on<00:05:25.010> one<00:05:25.220> side<00:05:25.430> you

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
that each of you spawn on one side you

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.580 
that each of you spawn on one side you
met<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.000> middle<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.570> figure<00:05:26.870> 8<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.200> spawn

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
met in the middle the figure 8 you spawn

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.860 
met in the middle the figure 8 you spawn
somewhere<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.550> then<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:29.120> meet<00:05:29.330> somewhere

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
somewhere and then you meet somewhere

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.240 
somewhere and then you meet somewhere
else<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.260> there's<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.710> wasn't<00:05:31.010> competitive

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
else like there's it wasn't competitive

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.970 
else like there's it wasn't competitive
at<00:05:31.520> all<00:05:31.610> they<00:05:32.480> obviously<00:05:32.630> took<00:05:33.200> out<00:05:33.740> the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
at all they obviously took out the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.980 
at all they obviously took out the
weapons<00:05:34.640> like<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.120> weapon<00:05:35.450> spawned<00:05:35.810> in

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
weapons like the weapon spawned in

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.520 
weapons like the weapon spawned in
randomly<00:05:36.410> in<00:05:36.710> Halo<00:05:37.040> 4<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:38.110> wasn't<00:05:39.110> tactical

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
randomly in Halo 4 so I wasn't tactical

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.520 
randomly in Halo 4 so I wasn't tactical
at<00:05:39.650> all<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.940> you<00:05:41.690> know<00:05:41.780> it<00:05:41.930> was<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> whole<00:05:42.320> bunch

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
at all and you know it was a whole bunch

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.140 
at all and you know it was a whole bunch
the<00:05:42.770> maps<00:05:43.070> were<00:05:43.250> just<00:05:43.460> designed<00:05:43.850> poorly

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
the maps were just designed poorly

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.600 
the maps were just designed poorly
that's<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.530> then<00:05:45.890> they<00:05:46.040> took<00:05:46.220> out<00:05:46.400> the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
that's it and then they took out the

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.340 
that's it and then they took out the
zombies<00:05:47.030> mode<00:05:47.240> which<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:47.720> played<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.050> lot<00:05:48.290> in

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
zombies mode which I played a lot in

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.900 
zombies mode which I played a lot in
Halo<00:05:48.590> Reach<00:05:48.680> probably<00:05:49.640> one<00:05:49.730> of<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.880> reasons

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
Halo Reach probably one of the reasons

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.340 
Halo Reach probably one of the reasons
why<00:05:50.210> I<00:05:50.240> kept<00:05:50.510> playing<00:05:50.570> halo<00:05:50.930> reach<00:05:51.050> for<00:05:51.200> so

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
why I kept playing halo reach for so

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.050 
why I kept playing halo reach for so
long<00:05:51.500> they<00:05:52.010> took<00:05:52.250> out<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.460> zombie<00:05:52.760> mode<00:05:52.910> and

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
long they took out the zombie mode and

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.250 
long they took out the zombie mode and
replaced<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.420> with<00:05:53.480> flood<00:05:53.780> which<00:05:53.930> sounded

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
replaced it with flood which sounded

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.900 
replaced it with flood which sounded
like<00:05:54.350> a<00:05:54.470> cool<00:05:54.650> idea<00:05:54.770> but<00:05:54.950> in<00:05:55.220> retrospect<00:05:55.520> it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
like a cool idea but in retrospect it

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.600 
like a cool idea but in retrospect it
wasn't<00:05:56.300> as<00:05:56.480> cool<00:05:56.780> that's<00:05:57.380> why<00:05:57.740> people<00:05:58.490> are

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
wasn't as cool that's why people are

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.930 
wasn't as cool that's why people are
saying<00:05:58.910> that<00:05:59.120> halo<00:05:59.630> halo<00:06:00.530> 5<00:06:00.920> might<00:06:01.460> not<00:06:01.760> be

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
saying that halo halo 5 might not be

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.370 
saying that halo halo 5 might not be
good<00:06:02.060> that's<00:06:02.270> why<00:06:02.390> people<00:06:02.690> aren't<00:06:02.840> as<00:06:03.050> hyped

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
good that's why people aren't as hyped

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.040 
good that's why people aren't as hyped
as<00:06:03.590> we<00:06:03.770> halo<00:06:03.980> 5<00:06:04.280> as<00:06:04.730> with<00:06:04.970> halo<00:06:05.180> 4<00:06:05.480> but<00:06:05.720> I<00:06:05.750> had<00:06:05.930> to

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
as we halo 5 as with halo 4 but I had to

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.480 
as we halo 5 as with halo 4 but I had to
admit<00:06:06.260> I<00:06:06.290> was<00:06:06.530> really<00:06:06.830> high<00:06:06.980> when<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.250> saw<00:06:07.430> the

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
admit I was really high when I saw the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.240 
admit I was really high when I saw the
trailer<00:06:07.820> at<00:06:08.060> e3<00:06:08.630> that<00:06:09.200> was<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.680> hypest<00:06:10.100> thing

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
trailer at e3 that was the hypest thing

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.010 
trailer at e3 that was the hypest thing
I<00:06:10.340> don't<00:06:10.460> know<00:06:10.520> why<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.760> got<00:06:11.000> so<00:06:11.030> high<00:06:11.420> because<00:06:11.810> I

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
I don't know why I got so high because I

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.180 
I don't know why I got so high because I
just<00:06:12.200> didn't<00:06:12.410> expect<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.770> I<00:06:12.860> thought<00:06:13.010> it<00:06:13.130> was

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
just didn't expect it I thought it was

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.800 
just didn't expect it I thought it was
metal<00:06:13.430> gear<00:06:13.580> solid<00:06:13.790> or<00:06:14.090> some<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.510> then<00:06:14.600> it<00:06:14.720> was

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
metal gear solid or some and then it was

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.070
