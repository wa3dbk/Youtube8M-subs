when it comes to that but you know as

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.160 
when it comes to that but you know as
far<00:03:38.680> as<00:03:38.890> like<00:03:39.010> depth<00:03:39.670> within<00:03:39.910> story<00:03:40.390> Dec<00:03:40.960> does

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
far as like depth within story Dec does

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.750

have<00:03:41.410> depth<00:03:41.740> in<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> but<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.400> feel<00:03:42.610> as<00:03:42.730> though

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
have depth in it but I feel as though

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.030 
have depth in it but I feel as though
writing<00:03:43.330> overtime<00:03:43.870> cuz<00:03:44.410> remember<00:03:44.500> DBZ<00:03:45.010> is

from the 90s and 80s and so now writing

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.160 
from the 90s and 80s and so now writing
has<00:03:47.920> gotten<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.250> lot<00:03:48.400> better<00:03:48.460> as<00:03:48.970> far<00:03:49.570> as<00:03:49.630> anime

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
has gotten a lot better as far as anime

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.350 
has gotten a lot better as far as anime
goes<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.710> monitor<00:03:51.010> goes<00:03:51.130> because<00:03:51.370> it's<00:03:52.180> like

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
goes and monitor goes because it's like

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.540 
goes and monitor goes because it's like
this<00:03:52.900> stuff<00:03:53.230> like<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.650> also<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.160> example

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
this stuff like in also for example

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.800 
this stuff like in also for example
stuff<00:03:54.970> will<00:03:55.090> be<00:03:55.180> set<00:03:55.420> up<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.690> beginning

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
stuff will be set up in the beginning

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.450 
stuff will be set up in the beginning
and<00:03:56.230> then<00:03:56.410> you'll<00:03:56.710> start<00:03:56.920> learning<00:03:57.040> about<00:03:57.220> it

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
and then you'll start learning about it

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.910 
and then you'll start learning about it
later<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:58.420> know<00:03:58.540> Naruto's<00:03:59.110> QB<00:03:59.590> thing<00:03:59.800> we

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
later on you know Naruto's QB thing we

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.530 
later on you know Naruto's QB thing we
didn't<00:04:00.160> learn<00:04:00.250> about<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.700> more<00:04:01.090> until<00:04:01.390> later

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
didn't learn about it more until later

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.120 
didn't learn about it more until later
on<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.900> keeps<00:04:02.050> being<00:04:02.290> developed<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.770> with

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
on it keeps being developed and with

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.620 
on it keeps being developed and with

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
Dragon Ball Z is just kind of all laid

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.840 
Dragon Ball Z is just kind of all laid
out<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.470> what<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.710> is<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.460> how<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:06.700> is

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
out this is what it is this is how it is

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.580 
out this is what it is this is how it is
and<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.360> know<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.870> keep<00:04:08.020> on<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.200> from

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.620 
and you know you just keep on going from
there<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.130> definitely<00:04:09.820> gotta<00:04:10.150> say<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
there so I definitely gotta say that the

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.510 
there so I definitely gotta say that the
writing<00:04:11.020> in<00:04:11.140> Naruto<00:04:11.590> not<00:04:11.920> everything<00:04:12.400> is

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
writing in Naruto not everything is

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.370 
writing in Naruto not everything is
better<00:04:12.670> but<00:04:12.940> there's<00:04:13.360> more<00:04:13.630> depth<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.170> with

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
better but there's more depth to it with

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.110 
better but there's more depth to it with
