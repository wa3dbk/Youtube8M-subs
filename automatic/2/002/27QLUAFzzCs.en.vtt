little<00:00:32.279> me<00:00:34.070> you're<00:00:35.070> connecting<00:00:35.700> yourself<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
little me you're connecting yourself to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 
little me you're connecting yourself to
the<00:00:36.480> bigger<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> source<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.030> all

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the bigger so it is the source of all

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.889 
the bigger so it is the source of all
Lincoln<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> Lennox<00:00:40.219> men<00:00:41.239> go<00:00:42.239> through<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
Lincoln and Lennox men go through you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.279 
Lincoln and Lennox men go through you
and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.920> example<00:00:44.610> where

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
and then this is for example where

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
and then this is for example where
creativity<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.489> life<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.059> will

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
creativity comes into your life it will

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
creativity comes into your life it will
create<00:00:48.539> through<00:00:48.899> creativity<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:50.010> only<00:00:50.219> come

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
create through creativity can only come

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.020 
create through creativity can only come
in<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> learn<00:00:52.079> best<00:00:52.440> dimension<00:00:53.309> into

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in when you learn best dimension into

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
in when you learn best dimension into
your<00:00:54.360> line<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> source<00:00:56.510> energy<00:00:57.510> manifests

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
your line so the source energy manifests

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
your line so the source energy manifests
through<00:00:58.559> human<00:00:59.100> creativity<00:00:59.579> can<00:01:00.030> start<00:01:00.809> with

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
through human creativity can start with

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
through human creativity can start with
a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> means<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.070> tiny

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
a little thing that means a tiny

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149 
a little thing that means a tiny
creating<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.420> some<00:01:04.049> new<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> looking<00:01:04.890> at

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
creating more some new way of looking at

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.640 
creating more some new way of looking at
something<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:05.960> written<00:01:06.960> by<00:01:07.409> most

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
something already written by most

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
something already written by most
important<00:01:08.220> recognizing<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> can

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
important recognizing then when you can

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
important recognizing then when you can
be<00:01:10.080> conscious<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.830> consciousness<00:01:11.100> when

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
be conscious of the consciousness when

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550 
be conscious of the consciousness when
we<00:01:11.700> bring<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> presence<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we bring the presence of that which is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.560 
we bring the presence of that which is
consciousness<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> spirit<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
consciousness with the spirit of

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.710 
consciousness with the spirit of
or<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.800> Spirit<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.370> God<00:01:18.430> into<00:01:19.180> your<00:01:19.510> life<00:01:19.690> and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
or the Spirit of God into your life and

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.130 
or the Spirit of God into your life and
you<00:01:20.080> allow<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.740> direct<00:01:21.550> your<00:01:21.729> path<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
you allow that direct your path that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.340 
you allow that direct your path that
then<00:01:24.010> all<00:01:24.250> things<00:01:24.670> come<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.479> as<00:01:25.690> they

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
then all things come to you as they

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.430 
then all things come to you as they
should<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.540> that's<00:01:28.840> how<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.080> create

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
should just you that's how you create

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.690 
should just you that's how you create
love<00:01:30.040> its<00:01:30.610> flexible<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.690> truthful<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.400> that

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
love its flexible and truthful and that

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.230 
love its flexible and truthful and that
is<00:01:33.880> how<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.119> say<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:35.650> new<00:01:36.160> species<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.910> arising

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
is how you say a new species is arising

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.430 
is how you say a new species is arising
on<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.630> planet<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.770> arising<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.440> we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
on the planet it is arising now and we

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.920 
on the planet it is arising now and we
are<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.200> such<00:01:44.470> an<00:01:45.119> enormous<00:01:46.119> shift

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
are you this is such an enormous shift

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
are you this is such an enormous shift
in<00:01:47.640> consciousness<00:01:48.690> that's<00:01:49.690> happening<00:01:50.880> it's

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
in consciousness that's happening it's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.850 
in consciousness that's happening it's
almost<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.869> why<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.050> use<00:01:53.289> an<00:01:53.530> expression

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
almost this is why I use an expression

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.950 
almost this is why I use an expression
it's<00:01:54.670> almost<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.509> if<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.800> were<00:01:57.960> transforming

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
it's almost as if we were transforming

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
it's almost as if we were transforming
into<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.680> new<00:02:00.009> species<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.690> first<00:02:01.990> time<00:02:02.289> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
into a new species for the first time a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.669 
into a new species for the first time a
conscious<00:02:04.320> species<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:06.520> almost<00:02:06.820> missing

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
conscious species it's almost missing

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.320 
conscious species it's almost missing
humanity<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:08.830> only<00:02:09.190> now<00:02:09.640> beginning<00:02:10.000> to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
humanity was only now beginning to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.040 
humanity was only now beginning to
actually<00:02:10.869> break<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.380> yeah<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.600> mean<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:14.019> you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
actually break up yeah I mean would you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.570 
actually break up yeah I mean would you
share<00:02:14.320> with<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> rest<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.070> audience<00:02:15.190> in

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
share with the rest of the audience in

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.000
