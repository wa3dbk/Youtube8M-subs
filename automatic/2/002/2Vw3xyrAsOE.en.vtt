00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.990
 and then gang beauty that are then spoke 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 all welcome to another video here at 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 Today's video is one more channel. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.630
 challenge here in scar war guys some 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.079
 days ago I posted the challenge of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.239
 minimum sensitivity was quite complicated 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.570
 play with the minimum sensitivity I 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 I'm used to using 80 to 100 per 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 cent in the sensibility of minecraft and me 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 I almost screwed up a lot if you did not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 watched the video watch there that's on 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.820
 description was great, we got it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.989
 win with minimum accessibility today 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.399
 it was very cool 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.929
 and you suggested to me to do the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 sensitivity of the challenge of the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.899
 maximum sensitivity 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 It's been a few days since I 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.620
 I recorded the minimum accessibility then 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 I got used to it again with 76% of 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100
 sensitivity 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.200
 if I put in the maximum sensitivity 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 It will probably be very strange to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 play 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.500
 So I'm going to look for a room here and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.510
 When I get back, I'll actually come back. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.690
 when I come back I think the truth 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.670
 When I find I'll be back soon. 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.800
 Let's go guys, let's go, guys. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.660
 Let's go get what gives life to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.970
 This because the bag is crazy we are in the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.270
 map of the volcano and we will put the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.130
 sensitivity at high speed my god 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.910
 heaven I 'm even afraid of dying of mine 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 Mouse 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.230
 Carol chu end whoa guys I'm 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 seeing this here 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.350
 Let's see it here, just hand the sky. 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 Look, this looks hi, President. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 cococay grow 10 mbits mano de la cielo 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.210
 I'll give you a 360 maniac this time. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.460
 video the bag will be crazy I need 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.840
 to increase my fog a little more than 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.040
 I can not even know what 's going on. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.820
 making life 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.459
 guys I think I think the challenge of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.879
 sensitivity is worse than the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.040
 challenge of minimum sensitivity because 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.290
 It's very strange, it's really serious. 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.209
 Weird, this looks like I'm here. 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 Playing 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.109
 Actually, it does not look like it's playing. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 nothing seems like you buy a mouse 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.959
 new with 400 thousand 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.549
 is going through nasa etÃ¡ at the maximum of ipi 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.480
 made by nasa 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.209
 Our type you use the mouse will be bad 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.040
 who is going to climb slowly to this one arrives like this 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.060
 the nasa the guys give you a mouse 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:46.200
 beast of the world and you move one centimeter 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.989
 and deal with 516 human from the sky I am 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.739
 Lost folks it's too bad I'm 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.470
 trying to get used to it but it's something very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.359
 strange never seen anything like face looks 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.049
 Only I was trying to mine an arrow in the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.659
 face 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:06.870
 'our old man, my God, my God, my God 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.940
 Heaven, I'm going to try to kill a guy, but neither 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.030
 always gets close to his hand 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.730
 Look, this is too bad people are very 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.409
 bad and planck gets kinda shaky there 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.049
 My god, the stone bears the guy doing 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.470
 killed him on the island for there 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.450
 there the guy make a sloppy tower 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.730
 I'm going to try to provoke yesterday a guy 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.750
 Volcano two guys already on volcano 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.220
 My god, I'm sorry, I'm screwed. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.220
 total 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.139
 I'm going to try to climb a tower here. 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.540
 the guy is asking for a pittman I have with the 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.870
 sensitivity of the doom and the guy stays 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.069
 asking for a print on human morality in morality 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.930
 old man and he still gets up in a tower 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.940
 in the morals I'm going to put one in your head 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.579
 and already was already already was already already was already already 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.919
 My god, the face is the guy there, the guy. 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.870
 because he was running from me to 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.449
 island is fleeing to the island just talking 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.310
 no shame shameless shame from here 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.269
 I have all the strange sensitivity to 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.079

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.579
 My god is dead already already died 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.949
 The people I feel this will not go 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.380
 I do not feel this does not work. 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:19.709
 It's going to work, I'm not going to try to provoke 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.019
 one as I can at least get on 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.510
 volcano 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.810
 There are only two players left to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.760
 kill because it happened to this people who 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.220
 happened to these people, my God 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.630

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.750

 You'll be able to beat this here. Look at the 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.190
 sensitivity of my mouse 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.699
 I needed a daycare chain table

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.610
 crazy is like this was the challenge 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.599
 maximum sensitivity of the recorded 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.789
 first 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.690

 I killed three people despite having a 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:38.740
 asking for more expensive print I did not 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.830
 I could not even stand right I 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.469

 strange and nice if you are 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.770
 enjoying this challenge 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.199
 today was a little faster than the 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.510
 normal but it was very complicated not 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.700
 forget to let that one like 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.040
 so you help me a lot and 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.210
