00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
 Mom too now if you have to be there this Friday morning and let's go 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 start the program today talk about health the ministry of health 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.780
 experts warn of increased diagnoses of people with 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.529
 from cereals in the coming years there is no concrete number of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.109
 disease in the country but the government doctors estimated that between 20 and 5 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.050
 millions and 3 million Brazilians are infected to talk about this 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.960
 subject is receiving here today 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.090
 because the pathologist doctor Mauricio pacheco is very welcome after having 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.680
 fought 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.880
 Let's start by explaining although leaving home and passion highlighted in places 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.340
 who does not have basic sanitation 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.060
 in a smile she is actually part of any inflammation in the liver she has 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.220
 several proposals 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.490
 so leave the food spills some foods that are few 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.890
 and some civilians but you're specifically talking about a quitute repudiate 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.060
 patent for the virus to 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.560
 which is a virus transmitted via received other people who ingest the water 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.550
 contaminated with faeces so I really is more common in regions or 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.080
 do not have sewage treatment do not have water treatment - do not have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.850
 basic sanitation conditions 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 but this is only in relation to hepatitis a and the other PT plate and other 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.950
 features 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.820
 there, for example, hepatitis B is already a sexually transmitted disease and 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.620
 parenteral be it through the blood 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.030
 then it has reached the largest age group 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.320
 to kill adolescents are at the beginning of activity 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.250
 sexual 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.890
 and hepatitis c 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.940
 which is also very well-known very spoken that was the last one 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.140
 discovery she was most recently discovered 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.430
 is a parenteral transition aircraft primarily through the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.110
 blood 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.230
 then she they who transmitted much to hyundai of 92 through transfusion 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.240
 of blood that occurred without a fine is higher 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.499
 viral hepatitis in fact would be 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.820
 then it is because they have had inflammation in the liver 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.880
 a liver injury caused by a virus 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.569
 virus can cause this information from the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.100
 mumps virus in the chicken pox virus but here there are some viruses that they 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.069
 are specific for this whether they have a predilection for the child 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.370
 the telecentre in the body they will proceed from here exclaimed a son 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.519
 We need them but we need to be given 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.479
 virus b 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.749
 and the virose due to defeats there is some relation between general part 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:36.109
 trips are not living totally different madson have no relation 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.750
 on the other hand they share with some forms of transmission, 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.730
 but is also transmitted through sexual intercourse 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.110
 not protected and through sites such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C then 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.779
 some patients 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.689
 at the time that they contaminate pressure because it also cited tata ptb and 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.970
 psc that is possible but the small portion of the population still well 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.350
 what treatment should be given to the person who is contaminated by 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.289
 hepatitis to fine 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.939
 then go to that hepatitis b 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.450
 in the acute phase the organism itself has all the mechanisms out then 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:16.150
 specific treatment of hepatitis b 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.209
 Ã‰vora farm is enough for him to support the march by throwing up such a movement 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.360
 I will not marry Fred is in pain. 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.589
 of defense I feel bad there is no specific treatment 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.659
 water treatment is not effective 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.289
 the sewage network 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.729
 sanitation measures to prevent hepatitis 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.569
 condoms to avoid sexual contamination of hepatitis B 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.489
 mist the care of baksan everything is fine as g1 was made so i 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.980
 I discovered the disease passed that year without energy 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.640
 the staff have to be more in doubt than to score an autogolo consultation with the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.059
 telephone 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:02.579
 there are 2 1 camera with tunisia this phone each clinic 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.069
 is done by the lane and overturned 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.349
 and several other united states to university also 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.369
 2 1 0 5 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.809
 in footnote 7 9 to 8 beja 05 and 07 90 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.350
 but this was the statement good luck to you 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:19.840
 prefer
