00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
what I've got here is a box from

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.389 
what I've got here is a box from
deviantart<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:43.590> ordered<00:00:44.280> at

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
deviantart this was actually ordered at

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.689 
deviantart this was actually ordered at
the<00:00:44.489> same<00:00:44.730> time<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.780> print<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> came<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
the same time as the print but it came a

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.330 
the same time as the print but it came a
day<00:00:47.940> later<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.690> obviously<00:00:49.559> comes<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
day later so obviously comes from a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.150 
day later so obviously comes from a
different<00:00:50.850> place<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.679> know<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.129> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
different place or I don't know it was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
different place or I don't know it was
probably<00:00:53.780> they<00:00:54.780> could<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.050> probably<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
probably they could have probably just

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040 
probably they could have probably just
put<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.429> same<00:00:56.640> box<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> print<00:00:57.629> but

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
put this in the same box as a print but

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.610 
put this in the same box as a print but
they<00:00:58.489> didn't<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.839> it<00:01:00.839> probably<00:01:01.170> comes<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
they didn't and it probably comes from a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
they didn't and it probably comes from a
different<00:01:01.829> place<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.429> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.910> affects

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
different place so it kind of affects

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.110 
different place so it kind of affects
your<00:01:03.510> carriage<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.860> you're<00:01:04.980> ordering<00:01:05.160> lots

once because you get some discount some
things<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.950> moment<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.579> as<00:01:18.270> much

20<00:03:06.950> pounds<00:03:07.130> per<00:03:07.459> set<00:03:07.730> for<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.709> as

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
20 pounds per set for and they can be as

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.350 
20 pounds per set for and they can be as
