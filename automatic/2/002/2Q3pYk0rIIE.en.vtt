instance to the chart control over and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
instance to the chart control over and
drop<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.179> my<00:00:36.269> page<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> first<00:00:37.620> thing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
drop it on my page now the first thing

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.049 
drop it on my page now the first thing
that<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.890> need<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.039> do<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.460> select<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> data

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that I need to do is select the data

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.970 
that I need to do is select the data
source<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.050> used<00:00:40.289> by<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.530> chart

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
source that will be used by this chart

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.869 
source that will be used by this chart
so<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.609> can<00:00:42.980> select<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> new<00:00:44.219> data<00:00:44.429> source<00:00:44.609> there

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so I can select a new data source there

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.939 
so I can select a new data source there
are<00:00:44.940> none<00:00:45.089> in<00:00:45.179> my<00:00:45.300> project<00:00:45.749> here<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.379> our<00:00:46.769> case

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
are none in my project here in our case

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.950 
are none in my project here in our case
I'm<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.249> say<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.359> database<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.929> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I'm going to say the database is a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
I'm going to say the database is a
sequel<00:00:49.859> database<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.600> choose<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> connection

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
sequel database and choose a connection

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
sequel database and choose a connection
string<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.800> happens<00:00:53.159> that<00:00:53.219> I've

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
string it just so happens that I've

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
string it just so happens that I've
recently<00:00:54.300> used<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> connection<00:00:55.170> string<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
recently used a connection string to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
recently used a connection string to
pubs<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.159> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.429> ahead<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> select

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pubs so I'm going to go ahead and select

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.209 
pubs so I'm going to go ahead and select
that<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.649> let's<00:00:58.649> choose<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> different

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that one and let's choose a different

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.759 
that one and let's choose a different
table<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.539> gonna<00:01:00.749> choose<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> titles<00:01:01.589> table

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
table I'm gonna choose the titles table

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.499 
table I'm gonna choose the titles table
and<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.250> we'll<00:01:05.399> just<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.579> all<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> the

and for now we'll just take all of the
results<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.829> course<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> filter

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
results but of course you can filter

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
results but of course you can filter
your<00:01:09.060> results<00:01:09.270> based<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.840> whatever<00:01:10.079> select

criteria you want to use against your
data<00:01:12.060> source<00:01:12.560> now<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.649> three<00:01:14.490> other

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
data source now the three other

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.600 
data source now the three other
attributes<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.680> need<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:16.920> set<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.399> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
attributes that I need to set on the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
attributes that I need to set on the
chart<00:01:17.820> control<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.719> is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> type<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
chart control are one is the type of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
chart control are one is the type of
chart<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.280> I'm<00:01:20.520> gonna<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.909> gonna

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
chart you can see I'm gonna just gonna

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.800 
chart you can see I'm gonna just gonna
start<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> column<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.409> use<00:01:22.590> bars

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
start with a column but we can use bars

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
start with a column but we can use bars
step<00:01:24.810> lines<00:01:25.079> bubble<00:01:25.860> charts<00:01:26.250> what-have-you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
step lines bubble charts what-have-you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
step lines bubble charts what-have-you
so<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> whole<00:01:27.420> bunch<00:01:27.719> of<00:01:27.840> different

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so there are a whole bunch of different

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
so there are a whole bunch of different
types<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.500> charts<00:01:28.770> built<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.579> our<00:01:29.789> case

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
types of charts built in in our case

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
types of charts built in in our case
we'll<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.210> start<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.110> standard<00:01:31.530> bar

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
we'll just start with the standard bar

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.050 
we'll just start with the standard bar
chart<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.180> need<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> pick<00:01:33.990> x<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.500> y<00:01:35.060> value

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
chart now we need to pick x and y value

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
chart now we need to pick x and y value
members<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> x<00:01:37.799> value<00:01:37.979> member<00:01:38.490> let's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
members so for the x value member let's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.260 
members so for the x value member let's
choose<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.960> title<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> Y<00:01:41.579> value

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
choose the title and for the Y value

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.170 
choose the title and for the Y value
member<00:01:42.509> let's<00:01:42.689> choose<00:01:43.020> year-to-date<00:01:43.619> sales

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
member let's choose year-to-date sales

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
member let's choose year-to-date sales
that's<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.930> let's<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.289> ahead<00:01:46.469> and<00:01:46.560> run<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that's it now let's go ahead and run and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.349 
that's it now let's go ahead and run and
see<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.399> chart<00:01:47.670> looks<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.090> going

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
see what our chart looks like going

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.200 
see what our chart looks like going
against<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.899> data<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> pubs<00:01:50.039> database<00:01:53.210> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
against the data in the pubs database so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.800 
against the data in the pubs database so
you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.890> nice<00:01:56.700> looking<00:01:57.060> chart<00:01:57.390> very

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you can see a nice looking chart very

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.609 
you can see a nice looking chart very
simple<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> implement<00:01:58.590> let's<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.460> ahead<00:01:59.549> and

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
simple to implement let's go ahead and

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
simple to implement let's go ahead and
change<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> visuals<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.509> go

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
change the visuals of that so I can go

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
change the visuals of that so I can go
and<00:02:03.810> say<00:02:03.990> instead<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.439> column<00:02:04.799> chart

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and say instead of a column chart

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.450 
and say instead of a column chart
maybe<00:02:05.640> we'll<00:02:05.880> choose<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.869> bar<00:02:07.859> chart<00:02:10.460> fair

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
maybe we'll choose a bar chart fair

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.060 
maybe we'll choose a bar chart fair
enough<00:02:11.640> let's<00:02:11.760> go<00:02:11.970> ahead<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> run<00:02:12.270> again

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.830 

and<00:02:16.070> now<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:16.790> have<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.270> different<00:02:17.630> kind<00:02:17.690> of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and now we have a different kind of

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.080 
and now we have a different kind of
chart<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.710> can<00:02:18.860> see<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.220> really<00:02:19.730> easy<00:02:19.970> to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
chart so you can see that really easy to
