00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
of the mirrors the mirrors are going to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.110 
of the mirrors the mirrors are going to
take<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.830> little<00:03:18.980> getting<00:03:19.130> used<00:03:19.400> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
take a little getting used to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.680 
take a little getting used to
they<00:03:20.480> seem<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:21.050> work<00:03:21.200> fine<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:22.180> would<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.360> them

a<00:03:23.720> little<00:03:24.020> outboard<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.920> but<00:03:25.580> that's<00:03:25.940> just

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
a little outboard more but that's just

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.700 
a little outboard more but that's just
something<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.510> think<00:03:26.570> it's<00:03:26.840> just<00:03:26.960> something<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
something I think it's just something I

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.560 
something I think it's just something I
have<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.890> be<00:03:27.950> used<00:03:28.130> okay<00:03:28.760> compared<00:03:29.270> to<00:03:29.420> other

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
have to be used okay compared to other
