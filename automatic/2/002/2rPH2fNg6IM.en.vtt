from there really

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.530 
from there really
good<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> course<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.800> mix<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.540> and

good of course like mix it up with and
thicker<00:02:15.960> lines<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.180> is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
thicker lines but I don't think this is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.800 
thicker lines but I don't think this is
necessary<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.819> small<00:02:21.300> head

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
necessary on this in a small head

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.640 
necessary on this in a small head
drawing<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.069> zombie<00:02:23.490> dragon

I<00:02:29.739> thought<00:02:30.120> yeah<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:32.049> would<00:02:32.140> be

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
I thought yeah I think that would be

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.679 
I thought yeah I think that would be
some<00:02:33.519> con<00:02:33.790> some<00:02:34.420> kind<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:34.840> sculptor<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:37.450> go

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
over the Incan stage and you know just

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.339 
over the Incan stage and you know just
to<00:02:41.890> improve<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.400> drawing<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.140> really<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
to improve the drawing and really just

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.759 
to improve the drawing and really just
to<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:45.239> look<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.299> yeah<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.319> thinking

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
to make it look like yeah the thinking

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.630 
to make it look like yeah the thinking
stage<00:02:48.329> actually<00:02:49.739> add<00:02:50.739> something<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
stage actually add something to the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.059 
stage actually add something to the
drawing<00:02:51.939> as<00:02:52.299> well<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.909> which<00:02:54.909> it<00:02:55.150> often<00:02:55.569> does

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
drawing as well so which it often does

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.349 
drawing as well so which it often does
it<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:58.569> sort<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.079> like<00:02:59.139> helps<00:03:00.120> helps<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
it it's sort of like helps helps you

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.699 
it it's sort of like helps helps you
like<00:03:01.569> refine<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:03.099> design<00:03:04.379> that's<00:03:05.379> what<00:03:05.590> I've

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
like refine the design that's what I've

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.819 
like refine the design that's what I've
often<00:03:05.889> found<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.609> Incan<00:03:07.030> stage<00:03:07.829> sometimes

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
often found the Incan stage sometimes

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.940 
often found the Incan stage sometimes
you<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.159> you<00:03:10.000> can<00:03:10.150> mess<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.769> which<00:03:11.769> I've

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you can you can mess it up which I've

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220 
you can you can mess it up which I've
often<00:03:12.099> done<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.639> past<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.959> this

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
make sure it's a fun design process for

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.309 
make sure it's a fun design process for
me<00:03:37.239> really<00:03:37.840> sir

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
times is this just a concept sketch so I

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.110 
times is this just a concept sketch so I
want<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.290> worry<00:04:17.530> too<00:04:17.799> much<00:04:17.829> about<00:04:19.799> exact

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
want to worry too much about exact

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.990 
want to worry too much about exact
details<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.680> things<00:04:23.680> like<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.040> are<00:04:24.520> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
details and things like that are you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.570 
details and things like that are you
know<00:04:25.750> whether<00:04:25.990> or<00:04:26.110> not<00:04:26.350> here<00:04:28.020> sketches

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
know whether or not here sketches

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.149 
know whether or not here sketches
not<00:04:31.300> too<00:04:31.629> much<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.139> not<00:04:32.349> such<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.539> such<00:04:34.539> as<00:04:34.780> a

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
not too much in the not such a such as a

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.659 
not too much in the not such a such as a
Finnish<00:04:36.159> standard<00:04:36.789> or<00:04:37.060> something<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.840> that

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
Finnish standard or something like that

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.939 
Finnish standard or something like that
and<00:04:39.669> that's<00:04:40.479> pretty<00:04:40.719> much<00:04:40.810> why<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.199> usually<00:04:41.770> do

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
and that's pretty much why I usually do

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.050 
and that's pretty much why I usually do
with<00:04:42.129> my<00:04:42.280> drawings<00:04:42.699> I<00:04:43.349> don't<00:04:44.349> really<00:04:44.849> try<00:04:45.849> and

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
with my drawings I don't really try and

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.119 
with my drawings I don't really try and
finish<00:04:46.439> all<00:04:47.439> of<00:04:47.500> my<00:04:47.830> drawing<00:04:48.069> sadist<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:50.129> just

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
finish all of my drawing sadist I just

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.369 
finish all of my drawing sadist I just
move<00:04:51.310> on<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.699> next<00:04:51.729> drawing<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.539> that's

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
move on to the next drawing and that's

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.629 
move on to the next drawing and that's
the<00:04:53.500> best<00:04:53.680> way<00:04:53.889> for<00:04:54.879> me<00:04:54.909> is<00:04:55.210> an<00:04:55.360> iced<00:04:56.639> you

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
the best way for me is an iced you

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.420 
the best way for me is an iced you
notice<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.150> create<00:04:58.539> new<00:04:58.750> drawings<00:04:59.310> every<00:05:00.310> now

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
notice to create new drawings every now

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.529 
notice to create new drawings every now
and<00:05:00.580> again<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:02.789> move<00:05:03.789> on<00:05:03.969> to<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.150> next<00:05:04.270> one

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
and again and move on to the next one

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.879 
and again and move on to the next one
basically<00:05:05.110> us<00:05:05.759> that's<00:05:06.759> the<00:05:06.940> way<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.800> it's<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
basically us that's the way I it's the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.679 
basically us that's the way I it's the
way<00:05:09.039> I<00:05:09.069> roll<00:05:10.830> if<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.009> can<00:05:12.129> sailor<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.940> know

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:14.689 
way I roll if you can sailor you know

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.790 
way I roll if you can sailor you know
with<00:05:15.319> am<00:05:15.529> i<00:05:15.860> foolish<00:05:16.369> accent

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
with am i foolish accent

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.550 
with am i foolish accent
so<00:05:19.669> how's<00:05:20.240> it

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
so how's it

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560 
so how's it
there's<00:05:22.190> always<00:05:22.520> like<00:05:22.970> when<00:05:23.150> most<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.510> my

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
there's always like when most of my

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.100 
there's always like when most of my
drawings<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:24.260> i<00:05:24.560> like<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.040> wink<00:05:25.810> quite<00:05:26.810> quickly
