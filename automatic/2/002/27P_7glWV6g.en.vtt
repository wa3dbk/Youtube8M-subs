Orchestrator Asaf aroond started just
basically<00:01:30.110> correcting<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.680> stuff<00:01:30.829> on<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
basically correcting this stuff on the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.380 
basically correcting this stuff on the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
fly right there at the conductor stance

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.389 
fly right there at the conductor stance
so<00:01:32.659> they<00:01:33.259> were<00:01:33.320> working<00:01:33.680> ahead<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
so they were working ahead of the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.679 
so they were working ahead of the
musicians<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.240> when<00:01:35.360> they<00:01:35.420> would<00:01:35.509> take

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
musicians so that when they would take

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:36.880

their<00:01:35.840> breaks<00:01:36.079> they<00:01:36.259> would<00:01:36.380> replace<00:01:36.619> their

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
their breaks they would replace their

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.399 
their breaks they would replace their
their<00:01:37.520> their<00:01:38.180> parts<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.719> corrected

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
parts and basically in in a four hour

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.539 
parts and basically in in a four hour
session<00:01:42.649> we<00:01:42.740> were<00:01:42.829> still<00:01:43.039> able<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.280> nail<00:01:43.520> all

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549
