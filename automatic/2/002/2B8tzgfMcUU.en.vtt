00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 I always thought that having one 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.859
 smartphone somehow lighten up 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.600
 life is the exact opposite 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.010
 between the various social messages and notifications 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:22.340
 anything else can really become a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 ready nightmare 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 we encounter the same problem when 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.279
 we decide to listen to music with 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.279
 the smartphone 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 mario 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.790
 among other things we do not even make ourselves 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.930
 I count on how much they have influenced 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.489
 our way of life 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.080
 for example, something could happen 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.610
 that could jeopardize the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.170
 our life and that of others 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 but be assured that we will give it 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.720
 priority is to show what is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.720
 happening with a video 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.870
 not to mention the fact that by now no 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.850
 communicates more I mean without a 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.340
 phone that to prove this are there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.270
 lunches and dinners please let us finish 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.270
 all the same way 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.280
 this thing and sad our walls 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.250
 smartphone addiction and such from 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.590
 take us to look at it about 150 times a 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 day we check it 15 times for 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.660
 time 23 times for messages and 22 times 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.869
 for the secretariat but it is still closed 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.479
 the secretariat on average once every 6 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.979
 minutes and the positive side is very much 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.899
 to have a smartphone and that can 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.790
 become whatever you want one 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.229
 stack a compass an alarm clock 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.030
 calendar with satellite navigator 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.039
 a camera 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.030
 etc. etc. and about 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.950
 camera 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.720
 I don't understand this mania for making shares 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.550
 it must have seemed happy at all costs 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 people post their photos on 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.090
 social trying to give the idea that yes 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.230
 they are having a great time 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.100
 even if it's not true you want to do one 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.100
 photos to post on facebook 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.489
 according to an American study I am well 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 500 million photos every day 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.610
 they are taken and loaded on the various ones 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.560
 social network 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.480
 the most loaded photos are those of the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.450
 been where we are and what we are 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 eating and think 24 for a while 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 one hundred of the population reveals its own 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.570
 all of one's life on the web 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.730
 then they complain if thieves enter 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.280
 at home they too are on social media and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.780
 check out all this concentrated things 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.820
 on a single object that has as its function 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.290
 main is to call and that 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.000
 paradoxically also the thing that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.170
 we rarely make landslide spend money 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.970
 to waste nothing 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.890
 we can also download millions of 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.350
 really useful and complex applications 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.390
 signals such as I am another 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.620
 that would simply be to say 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.420
 when 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.909

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.909

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.510
 offered a figure of one million 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.599
