 each with its own taste 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.819

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.819
 damn it 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:00.920
 to move forward 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:05.099

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.129
 fish come more or less this but it is not 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.259
 This is almost over, the game is already over. 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.849
 ready to run yankees from 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.460

 who wants to apply twice here and 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.940
 Do what I said about where I 'd be 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.610
 ready to be played but has to 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.300
 test if you play this very difficult game 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.300
 the Flemish has to test 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.130
 ready not pick up the single player since 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.210
 the game does not have a free translation 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.680
 language 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.710
 to give it gives to play in English even 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.750
 even because today the world revolves around 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.680
 rivalry in the United States and 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.770
 Soviet Union, so if there is a point 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.110
 country would be a good thing complicated 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.640
 humor and an exciting game he already 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.800
 the tape begins 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.800
 started this way because I had already played 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.830
 but spoke good if I see a 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.980
 shared way on cushion 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.380
 but if you want to comment, if you gave some 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.050
 big circulation error and tals 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.630
 if I resolved to solve the 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.630
