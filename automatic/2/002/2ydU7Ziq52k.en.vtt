get some murky it's complex and it's
deep<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.009> created<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> harder-edged

computer files you're a mole in the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
computer files you're a mole in the
terrorist<00:00:45.990> group<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.650> you've<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> figure

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
terrorist group and you've got to figure

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.280 
terrorist group and you've got to figure
out<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.240> these<00:00:48.390> guys<00:00:48.600> are<00:00:48.660> doing<00:00:48.900> it<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
out what these guys are doing it and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.350 
out what these guys are doing it and
stop<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:49.860> doing<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.310> but<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> same

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stop them from doing it but at the same

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660 
stop them from doing it but at the same
time<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:52.230> working<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.830> them<00:00:53.100> you're

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
time you're working for them you're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
time you're working for them you're
working<00:00:53.940> against<00:00:54.330> them<00:00:54.650> you're<00:00:55.650> working<00:00:55.860> with

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
working against them you're working with

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
working against them you're working with
NSA<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.580> well<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.990> game<00:00:58.200> actually

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
NSA as well so the game actually

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.460 
NSA as well so the game actually
balances<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.220> two<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
balances these two out and it's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.410 
balances these two out and it's
manifests<00:01:01.470> into<00:01:01.620> meters<00:01:02.400> trust<00:01:03.000> meters<00:01:03.330> that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
manifests into meters trust meters that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
manifests into meters trust meters that
show<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.990> the<00:01:04.110> time<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.500> game<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
show up all the time in the game so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.440 
show up all the time in the game so
you're<00:01:05.370> constantly<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.910> to<00:01:05.940> balance

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you're constantly have to balance

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.470 
you're constantly have to balance
between<00:01:06.600> them<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.800> adds<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:09.000> adds<00:01:09.240> an

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
between them this adds this adds an

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.300 
between them this adds this adds an
interest<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.860> characters

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
interest because there are characters

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
interest because there are characters
and<00:01:11.550> people's<00:01:12.060> lives<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.510> stake<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and people's lives at stake and the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
and people's lives at stake and the
decisions<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.190> make<00:01:14.400> eventually<00:01:15.230> have<00:01:16.230> an

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
decisions you make eventually have an

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
decisions you make eventually have an
effect<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.250> outcome<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.270> game<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
effect on the outcome of the game and in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.540 
effect on the outcome of the game and in
the<00:01:19.020> end<00:01:19.110> there<00:01:19.590> are<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.159> endings

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
the end there are actually three endings

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.180 
the end there are actually three endings
and<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:21.510> way<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.870> play<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> game<00:01:22.320> decides

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
and the way you play the game decides

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.130 
and the way you play the game decides
those<00:01:23.460> endings<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:24.480> tension<00:01:24.840> between<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
those endings the tension between the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
those endings the tension between the
forces<00:01:25.550> creates<00:01:26.550> involvement<00:01:27.300> more<00:01:27.390> involved

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
forces creates involvement more involved

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.850 
forces creates involvement more involved
in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> player<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:28.500> care<00:01:28.830> about

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
in the player so you actually care about

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.700 
in the player so you actually care about
the<00:01:29.100> story<00:01:29.370> this<00:01:29.520> time<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.440> one<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> other

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the story this time and one of the other

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
the story this time and one of the other
good<00:01:31.890> things<00:01:32.130> about<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:33.150> know

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
good things about it is that you know

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
good things about it is that you know
it's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.720> stealth<00:01:33.990> game<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
it's a stealth game so how good is the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790 
it's a stealth game so how good is the
AI<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.479> AI<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:37.260> sharpened<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.979> number

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
AI and the AI has sharpened up a number

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.430 
AI and the AI has sharpened up a number
first<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:39.950> all<00:01:40.070> there<00:01:40.670> are<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.790> lot<00:01:40.970> more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
first of all there are a lot more

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.140 
first of all there are a lot more
characters<00:01:42.440> on<00:01:42.590> screen<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.580> where<00:01:43.850> there<00:01:44.030> was

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
characters on screen so where there was

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.300 
characters on screen so where there was
one<00:01:44.330> or<00:01:44.510> two<00:01:44.540> before<00:01:45.050> in<00:01:45.230> chaos<00:01:45.500> theory<00:01:45.740> there

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
one or two before in chaos theory there

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.460 
one or two before in chaos theory there
are<00:01:46.490> five<00:01:46.730> six<00:01:47.090> eight<00:01:47.390> characters<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.320> screen

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
are five six eight characters on screen

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.380 
are five six eight characters on screen
and<00:01:48.890> they're<00:01:49.460> all<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.880> know<00:01:50.000> while<00:01:50.270> you're

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and they're all you know while you're

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.820 
and they're all you know while you're
playing<00:01:50.570> on<00:01:50.720> normal<00:01:51.050> mode<00:01:51.110> they're<00:01:51.680> all

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
playing on normal mode they're all

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.260 
playing on normal mode they're all
looking<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.550> anytime<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.030> they

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
looking for you and anytime that they

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.250 
looking for you and anytime that they
see<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.480> you<00:01:53.690> know<00:01:53.720> they're<00:01:53.900> gonna<00:01:53.990> come<00:01:54.140> out

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
see you you know they're gonna come out

see you you know they're gonna come out
and<00:01:54.350> shoot<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.770> two<00:01:55.340> or<00:01:55.430> three<00:01:55.610> shots<00:01:55.910> is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
and shoot and two or three shots is

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.910 
and shoot and two or three shots is
actually<00:01:56.540> gonna<00:01:56.660> kill<00:01:56.930> you<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:57.470> can't<00:01:57.740> take

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920

them<00:01:58.040> any<00:01:58.190> more<00:01:58.280> than<00:01:58.340> that

so keep an eye out for those decisions
because<00:02:33.709> they'll<00:02:34.040> affect<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.610> game

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
was as with all stealth games we've got

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.210 
was as with all stealth games we've got
you<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.020> trial<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.590> error<00:03:41.710> gameplay<00:03:42.160> to

so if you like stealth games you're

up in no ammonia never really lose too

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.550 
up in no ammonia never really lose too
much<00:03:59.170> trust<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:00.460> either<00:04:00.550> side<00:04:01.330> so<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:02.410> can

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
much trust from either side so you can

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.050 
much trust from either side so you can
kind<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.860> screw<00:04:03.160> up<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.400> bunch<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.670> times<00:04:03.880> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
kind of screw up a bunch of times and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.030 
kind of screw up a bunch of times and
still<00:04:04.450> gain<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:05.050> trust<00:04:05.110> back<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.860> so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
still gain that trust back and so

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.740 
still gain that trust back and so
there's<00:04:06.550> not<00:04:06.700> as<00:04:06.790> much<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.390> know<00:04:07.420> hardcore

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
there's not as much you know hardcore

at<00:04:19.450> times<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.840> just<00:04:20.110> hangs<00:04:20.320> around<00:04:20.500> 30<00:04:20.950> it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
at times it just hangs around 30 it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.250 
at times it just hangs around 30 it
takes<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.090> long<00:04:22.270> time<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.540> load<00:04:22.810> up<00:04:22.990> there's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
takes a long time to load up there's

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.560 
takes a long time to load up there's
it's<00:04:23.620> really<00:04:23.890> slow<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> lot<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.430> times<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.910> mean

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it's really slow a lot of times I mean

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.120 
it's really slow a lot of times I mean
the<00:04:25.690> game<00:04:25.840> kind<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.080> starts<00:04:26.350> off<00:04:26.470> slow<00:04:26.740> like

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
the game kind of starts off slow like

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.220 
the game kind of starts off slow like
the<00:04:27.310> first<00:04:27.640> two<00:04:27.730> levels<00:04:28.030> could<00:04:28.900> be<00:04:28.960> better

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
the first two levels could be better

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.840 
the first two levels could be better
there<00:04:29.380> could<00:04:29.470> be<00:04:29.500> more<00:04:29.710> enticing<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:30.280> think<00:04:30.520> as

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
there could be more enticing I think as

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.210 
there could be more enticing I think as
the<00:04:31.390> game<00:04:31.570> goes<00:04:31.840> along<00:04:31.900> it<00:04:32.590> gets<00:04:32.830> better<00:04:33.070> and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
the game goes along it gets better and

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.280 
the game goes along it gets better and
better<00:04:33.280> in<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:34.480> end<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.810> Splinter<00:04:35.110> Cell

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
better in the end the Splinter Cell

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.070 
better in the end the Splinter Cell
double<00:04:35.530> agent<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.490> real<00:04:36.910> leap<00:04:37.570> for<00:04:37.900> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
double agent is a real leap for the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.410 
double agent is a real leap for the
series<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.500> change<00:04:38.800> for<00:04:38.980> this<00:04:39.070> series

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
series and a change for this series

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.880 
series and a change for this series
there<00:04:40.420> are<00:04:40.450> harder<00:04:40.870> decisions<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.440> make<00:04:41.590> there

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
there are harder decisions to make there

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.080 
there are harder decisions to make there
are<00:04:41.950> actually<00:04:42.160> decisions<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.610> make<00:04:42.730> there's<00:04:43.030> a

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
are actually decisions to make there's a

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.030 
are actually decisions to make there's a
storyline<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:44.170> multiplayer<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:44.860> more

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
storyline the multiplayer is more

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.070 
storyline the multiplayer is more
accessible<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:46.240> you've<00:04:46.570> got<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.720> game<00:04:46.930> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
accessible and you've got a game that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.140 
accessible and you've got a game that
crosses<00:04:47.440> into<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> different<00:04:47.980> territory<00:04:48.610> which

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
crosses into a different territory which

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.690 
crosses into a different territory which
I<00:04:49.270> think<00:04:49.540> really<00:04:50.320> makes<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:51.310> much<00:04:51.670> more

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
I think really makes it a much more

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.170 
I think really makes it a much more
interesting<00:04:52.300> game<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.800> does<00:04:54.180> it

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
interesting game and I think it does it

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.450 
interesting game and I think it does it
plays<00:04:55.480> off<00:04:55.750> these<00:04:55.960> balancing<00:04:56.620> agencies

plays off these balancing agencies

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.030 
plays off these balancing agencies
really<00:04:57.670> well<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.330> gets<00:04:58.480> this<00:04:58.690> character<00:04:59.650> it's

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
really well it gets this character it's

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.280 
really well it gets this character it's
you<00:05:00.340> involved<00:05:00.970> more<00:05:01.120> in<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.330> storyline<00:05:01.720> in

you involved more in the storyline in

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.510 
you involved more in the storyline in
the<00:05:02.350> game

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520
