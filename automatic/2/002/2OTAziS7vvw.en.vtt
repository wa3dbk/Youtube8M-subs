00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
better about posting videos but I think

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.420 
better about posting videos but I think
everybody<00:00:29.519> needs<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.939> break<00:00:30.090> sometimes<00:00:30.750> and

it's still disgusting and it makes

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
it's still disgusting and it makes
drinking<00:01:14.250> water<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:16.909> lot<00:01:17.909> harder<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.840> as

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
drinking water a lot harder because as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
drinking water a lot harder because as
soon<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> hits<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.890> tongue<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.610> like

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
guess because the tongue scraper did

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
guess because the tongue scraper did
that<00:01:30.869> work<00:01:31.189> which<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.310> learned<00:01:32.549> during<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.880> last
