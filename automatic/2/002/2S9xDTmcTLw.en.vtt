00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
easiest way I found doing it was to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.200 
easiest way I found doing it was to
throw<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.150> gas<00:02:52.300> canisters<00:02:53.160> away<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:54.520> once<00:02:55.060> you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
throw the gas canisters away so once you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.760 
throw the gas canisters away so once you
get<00:02:55.570> climbed<00:02:55.960> down<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.380> get<00:02:56.530> out<00:02:56.650> the

right and up the right most stairs and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.000 
right and up the right most stairs and
there'll<00:03:04.600> be<00:03:04.630> six<00:03:04.960> gas<00:03:05.200> canisters<00:03:05.710> up<00:03:05.830> there

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
there'll be six gas canisters up there

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.820 
there'll be six gas canisters up there
and<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.750> those<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.500> throw<00:03:08.740> them
