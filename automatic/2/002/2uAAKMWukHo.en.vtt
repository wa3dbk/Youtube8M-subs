looking<00:05:53.810> for<00:05:53.990> raid<00:05:54.140> finder<00:05:54.350> you<00:05:54.620> will<00:05:54.770> need<00:05:54.950> to

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
looking for raid finder you will need to

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.590 
looking for raid finder you will need to
be<00:05:55.100> level<00:05:55.400> 85<00:05:55.790> and<00:05:56.000> I'm<00:05:56.060> sure<00:05:56.240> that<00:05:56.419> there<00:05:56.570> will

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
be level 85 and I'm sure that there will

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.440 
be level 85 and I'm sure that there will
be<00:05:56.810> like<00:05:57.230> an<00:05:57.350> eye<00:05:57.530> level<00:05:57.830> requirement<00:05:58.760> I<00:05:58.910> think

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
be like an eye level requirement I think

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.940 
be like an eye level requirement I think
when<00:05:59.600> they<00:05:59.690> first<00:05:59.930> introduced<00:06:00.560> this<00:06:00.740> it's

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
when they first introduced this it's

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.470 
when they first introduced this it's
only<00:06:01.310> going<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.490> be<00:06:01.610> for<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.850> Dragon<00:06:02.270> Soul

only going to be for the Dragon Soul
raid<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.990> then<00:06:03.110> as<00:06:03.320> it<00:06:03.500> gets<00:06:03.650> more<00:06:03.800> popular

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
raid and then as it gets more popular

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.780 
raid and then as it gets more popular
they'll<00:06:04.490> add<00:06:04.700> more<00:06:04.940> raids<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:06.440> system<00:06:06.919> the
