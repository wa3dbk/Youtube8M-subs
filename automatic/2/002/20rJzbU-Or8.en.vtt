00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 The first part of the lifting loop as we consider 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.940
 nakida through one loop tied again 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:05.970

 in the second I crochet the column without nakida 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.030
 I skip one loop in the next 5 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 double crochets in one loop and all 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.130
 I knit it for the front wall of the loop 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130
 the grounds 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.030
 again through one loop column without 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.870
 nakida for the front wall of the loop 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.830
 the bases through one loop of 5 columns with 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.400
 nakida from one loop, too, I knit everything for 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.890

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.230
