00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 good morning princess the new video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.850
 tag 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.269
 but no one has never done one 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.179
 like never before today new video tag 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.480
 requested by one of you below 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.920
 instagram tang is a tag I didn't have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.789
 never seen me you did it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 notice and watched some videos here and there 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 there on the pipe and I said it's a video 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 I think it's very interesting then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 I decided to do it too 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.170
 and it is the video in which I show you my 5 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 brecht in favorite cream 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.510
 since they are usually five, yes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.120
 I make video and end and start 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 immediately banning the first 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 eye shadow in cream that among all those 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 which I really is my favorite is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 this is the pain pot of brands or 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.890
 in painterly coloring that this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.800
 beautiful pink flesh dull ideal as a base on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 the whole eyelid as a base for 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.480
 an eye shadow for any kind of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.370
 eye shadow to apply after mario 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 use even alone when maybe 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.439
 I'm in a hurry 1 worth too much makeup 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.020
 I apply this with your finger across the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.840
 eyelid a line of eyeliner but stand 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 I'm going to have place it's amazing why 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.580
 it is also worth using all the lanes 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.619
 all the discolorations of the eyelid and it lasts 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 a lot because the eye shadow does not enter 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.790
 the folds and even if used by 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 it just goes into the folds so it's 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.400
 incredible I believe that among all the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.140
 max payne bot eye shadows are among the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.430
 their most good products at least my opinion 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 this can't because if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.470
 we are on the 18 19 euro, however, according to me 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 in short the penalty is the post pin 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.030
 are always the will always remain the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 first pot for me then another product that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 instead coast amino costs significantly less 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 and you know that I love them because I made them 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.299
 see in the tutorials in the videos of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.600
 Favorites are the pupa and vamp eye cream 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.829
 shadow this in color 200 that 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.880
 I also used in this tutorial 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.130
 to create the light point in the corner 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.020
 internal and these are not proper of the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.069
 eye shadows in cream but they are eye shadows 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.010
 these are also perfect for mousse 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.390
 go for a fast backup though 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.780
 very bright bright that obviously 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.260
 note the difference of the painter 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 nor do I think they are emeritus max 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.450
 unbelievable because they last a long time 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 the whole day do not enter the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.349
 pleats but maybe during the days 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.599
 hottest advice to go to 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.880
 however, apply a primer underneath 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.519
 because you never know even though 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.049
 in my experience they have not entered into the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.360
 they haven't formed all of those 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.870
 disgusting rulers and do not like a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.660
 nobody 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.099
 to these if I am not mistaken they cost on the 10 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.160
 11 euros 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.060
 there is a wide range of colors I have 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.829
 three because you love them so much 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.220
 use very very often and in two 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:07.090
 minutes are just another eye shadow ready 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.109
 in cream it is this and the benefits it has 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.750
 Value a little less than some 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.359
 less convenient because we are 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.630
 around 21 euros more or less 21 22 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.940
 this is the very famous stiletto e 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.489
 I took this because it's the color mi 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.569
 makes this beautiful burgundy crazy 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.310
 with coppery reflections and last year though 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
 not a year and a half ago I became 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.969
 mat 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.310
 to look for this color this burgundy 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.569
 pomace and did not find even one 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 the only one he found most was precisely 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.249
 this benefit and I took it immediately and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.239
 I use it both as a cream eye shadow 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:48.340
 that as an eyeliner because it does not leak 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.159
 pigmentation and very pigmented the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.290
 color is fixed on the eyelid 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.870
 but you still have time to go to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.849
 rolling it out is not like mine 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.829
 notice the make up for ever eye shadows 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.579
 those in cream do not remember how it is 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.889
 they call that if you do n't keep them right away 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.620
 they dry out and no longer move therefore not 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.260
 they give you no time to fade out 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.719
 this instead fades quietly 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.630
 then after once it dries 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.699
 in fact, this is incredible ideas 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.470
 bright color that goes a lot 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.820
 stand out the derby of the eyes you know 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.720
 which is something I really like 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.400
 then do the last two 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.479
 then I like to admire these together 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.610
 two I'll show you this babe first 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.740
 a real non-eye shadow in cream 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.509
 it's like the tall ones I have 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.490
 shown before that it is a bit blues 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.190
 this came out with the summer collection 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.259
 set up safaris of the number 04 also 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.199
 this however shown is shown up 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:52.599
 to nausea this beautiful green loses 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.300
 golden and I know I didn't show you 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:00.280
 that of before at the pala amp this 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.120
 number 200 and it is this silver gold 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.979
 also this beautiful closed parenthesis 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.840
 this is a real bretto in 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.880
 cream then a little more consistency 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.590
 dense compared to others who are 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.440
 just a bus 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.250
 I am going to spread this too with 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.289
 the finger for a little backstage result in 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.969
 adding up to tap the product with 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.610
 the small brush in the 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:28.210
 also pack this costs around the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.620
 10 11 euros water and soap and if not 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.469
 you still have it if you don't have it 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.090
 try purchased because you run 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.280
 if we are in September I have seen them again 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.120
 around from water and soap with others 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.610
 perfumeries 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.040
 and they came out in four different ones 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.830
 colorings to me the one that did the most 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.290
 it was buys that moreover is sosa of the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.990
 famous chanel driver that everyone 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.360
 they all praise by hand I have only this 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.880
 but I find myself by god 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.010
 definitely a value for money 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.240
 compared to that of shell not 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.610
 indifferently the last is this 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.229
 say tris that has an excellent relationship 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.919
 quality price 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:13.270
 this is the half stay number 0 20 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:16.000
 and this is this anthracite gray 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.729
 with golden green reflections that I like 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.340
 just a lot to match this of 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.210
 babe is very well this on the whole 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.090
 mobile eyelid 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.280
 this in the outer corner and in the 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.020
 eye fold I can go to 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.160
 apply trump quietly with the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.750
 finger and fades to perfection and I say 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.880
 which has an excellent value for money 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.070
 because the product itself is excellent because 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.030
 lasts long even this does not enter the 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.750
 pleats the color is intense pigmented 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.300
 very writing and it costs if I'm not mistaken 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.070
 3 euros and 99 such a thing that is 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.430
 the one among all those he showed 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.840
 today that costs less than everyone and I like it 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.020
 lot 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.960
 I think they have some colors 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:06.160
 monotone in the sense that there is a color 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.320
 golden however they are only more or less all 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.960
 in my opinion similar should be a little apr 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.780
 to the range of these eye shadows that mine 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.750
 notice they are great then 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.750
 finished video princesses I hope you come

 Hello
