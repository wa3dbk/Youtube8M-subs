00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
to start stop the motors you need to do

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.810 
to start stop the motors you need to do
CSC<00:00:08.120> command<00:00:08.770> pull<00:00:09.770> both<00:00:10.010> the<00:00:10.190> sticks<00:00:10.430> all<00:00:10.639> the

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
CSC command pull both the sticks all the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.900 
CSC command pull both the sticks all the
way<00:00:10.910> down<00:00:11.120> all<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.900> way<00:00:12.469> in<00:00:12.830> or<00:00:13.129> all<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.789> way

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
way down all the way in or all the way

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.450 
way down all the way in or all the way
out<00:00:13.940> we'll<00:00:14.660> start<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:15.199> motors<00:00:15.530> and<00:00:15.709> similarly

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
out we'll start the motors and similarly

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.120 
out we'll start the motors and similarly
doing<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.360> same<00:00:17.539> will<00:00:18.080> stop<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:18.590> motor<00:00:18.770> so

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
doing the same will stop the motor so

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.690 
doing the same will stop the motor so
here<00:00:19.310> we<00:00:19.400> go<00:00:19.430> down<00:00:20.180> right<00:00:21.190> motors<00:00:22.190> the<00:00:22.310> started

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
here we go down right motors the started

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700 
here we go down right motors the started
if<00:00:23.360> you<00:00:23.570> don't<00:00:23.750> do<00:00:23.840> anything<00:00:24.050> motors<00:00:24.560> will

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
if you don't do anything motors will

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.100 
if you don't do anything motors will
stop<00:00:25.070> after<00:00:25.280> a<00:00:25.610> while<00:00:25.850> otherwise<00:00:26.690> you<00:00:26.930> can

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
stop after a while otherwise you can

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.320 
stop after a while otherwise you can
stop<00:00:27.380> them<00:00:27.590> using<00:00:28.190> the<00:00:28.310> same<00:00:28.490> way<00:00:28.700> or<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.150> can

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
stop them using the same way or you can

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.150 
stop them using the same way or you can
put<00:00:29.539> them<00:00:29.690> in<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.930> middle<00:00:30.200> they<00:00:30.710> will<00:00:30.860> start

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
put them in the middle they will start

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.369 
put them in the middle they will start
the<00:00:31.250> motors<00:00:31.550> as<00:00:31.700> well<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.450> either<00:00:32.689> middle<00:00:33.050> or

extreme angles and fast life so please
do<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.539> try<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> manual<00:00:58.379> mode<00:00:58.589> unless<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
do not try the manual mode unless you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.420 
do not try the manual mode unless you
are<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.519> very<00:00:59.820> good<00:01:00.059> pilot<00:01:00.980> what<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
are a very good pilot what you want to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.260 
are a very good pilot what you want to
do<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> flip<00:01:03.089> the<00:01:03.299> switch<00:01:03.629> e<00:01:05.060> attitude<00:01:06.060> hold

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
do is flip the switch e attitude hold

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
do is flip the switch e attitude hold
mode<00:01:06.509> so<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.530> hold<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> altitude

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
mode so here it will hold the altitude

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.719 
mode so here it will hold the altitude
but<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.720> its<00:01:09.960> position<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:11.250> soon<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
but not its position and as soon as I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
but not its position and as soon as I
put<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.149> GPS<00:01:12.539> cohesion<00:01:12.990> hold<00:01:13.200> mode<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:14.100> will

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
put it in GPS cohesion hold mode it will

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.180 
put it in GPS cohesion hold mode it will
hold<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.210> position<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:17.990> all<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.190> now

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
hold the position as well all right now

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
hold the position as well all right now
in<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> position<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.720> need<00:01:21.899> to<00:01:21.929> do<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
in this position all you need to do is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
in this position all you need to do is
move<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.479> quadcopter<00:01:25.140> left<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.710> I'm

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
move the quadcopter left and right I'm

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
move the quadcopter left and right I'm
doing<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.369> slowly<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.630> actually

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
doing very slowly but you can actually

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010 
doing very slowly but you can actually
do<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.770> fast<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> slow<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
do them really really fast but slow is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.139 
do them really really fast but slow is
always<00:01:31.380> good<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.920> very<00:01:32.250> stable<00:01:32.670> videos

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
always good to get very stable videos

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.559 
always good to get very stable videos
now<00:01:34.050> all<00:01:34.319> you<00:01:34.470> need<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.649> do<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> stick

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
now all you need to do is use the stick

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.520 
now all you need to do is use the stick
and<00:01:37.759> fly<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.789> around<00:01:42.049> remember<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> control

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and fly it around remember to control

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
and fly it around remember to control
the<00:01:43.679> throttle<00:01:44.039> or<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.429> can<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.970> leave

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the throttle or you can actually leave

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.210 
the throttle or you can actually leave
the<00:01:45.179> product<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.770> hold<00:01:47.009> its

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the product so that it will hold its

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
the product so that it will hold its
altitude<00:01:47.399> which<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> dropping<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> altitude

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
altitude which is dropping the altitude

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.529 
altitude which is dropping the altitude
you<00:01:49.830> can<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> throttle<00:01:50.670> otherwise<00:01:51.240> not

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
you can use the throttle otherwise not

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can use the throttle otherwise not
otherwise<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> slide<00:01:53.039> around

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
otherwise you can just slide around

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.080 
otherwise you can just slide around
without<00:01:54.180> touching<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> total<00:01:55.289> jilin<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.090> get

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
without touching the total jilin and get

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.359 
without touching the total jilin and get
all<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> shots<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.100> let<00:01:59.100> me<00:01:59.189> show<00:01:59.340> you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
let the camera go down and straight at

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.130 
let the camera go down and straight at
the<00:05:34.830> moment<00:05:34.860> only<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.760> much<00:05:36.540> angle<00:05:37.020> is

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
the moment only this much angle is

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.200 
the moment only this much angle is
available<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:37.920> if<00:05:38.130> you<00:05:38.250> use<00:05:38.280> another<00:05:38.880> server

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
available but if you use another server

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.270 
available but if you use another server
like<00:05:39.510> high-tech<00:05:39.810> several<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:40.830> can<00:05:41.010> program

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
like high-tech several you can program

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.760 
like high-tech several you can program
it<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.640> tilt<00:05:42.180> even<00:05:42.750> more<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.320> look<00:05:43.590> at

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
it to tilt even more and look at

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.010 
it to tilt even more and look at
completely<00:05:44.520> down<00:05:44.820> unfortunately<00:05:45.540> exited

completely down unfortunately exited

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.920 
completely down unfortunately exited
faster<00:05:46.350> will<00:05:46.530> only<00:05:46.920> have<00:05:47.370> this<00:05:47.610> much<00:05:47.670> till<00:05:48.210> so

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
faster will only have this much till so

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
yes you can use a different server and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.360 
yes you can use a different server and
program<00:05:51.210> it<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.390> make<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:51.960> completely<00:05:52.590> look

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
program it to make it completely look

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.180
