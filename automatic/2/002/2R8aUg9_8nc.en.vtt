the<00:01:09.060> whole<00:01:09.979> provisional<00:01:10.979> release<00:01:11.100> day<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the whole provisional release day that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.719 
the whole provisional release day that
game<00:01:11.850> leaked<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.990> november<00:01:13.380> first<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.490> my

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
game leaked out of november first so my

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
game leaked out of november first so my
guess<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:16.220> GTA<00:01:17.220> 5<00:01:17.549> ps4<00:01:18.119> xbox<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.530> pc

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760 
guess is that GTA 5 ps4 xbox one and pc
will<00:01:20.820> release<00:01:21.210> probably<00:01:21.810> around<00:01:21.960> october

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
november time it won't be the same

tuesday's<00:01:26.070> koala<00:01:26.369> duty<00:01:26.790> simply<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
tuesday's koala duty simply because of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
tuesday's koala duty simply because of
midnight<00:01:28.530> launch<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.159> they'll<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> nude

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
midnight launch and they'll do a nude

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.240

midnight<00:01:30.810> launch<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.290> GTA<00:01:31.619> 5<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:31.890> that's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
midnight launch with GTA 5 and that's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.410 
midnight launch with GTA 5 and that's
obviously<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.909> midnight<00:01:33.210> launch

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
obviously going to be midnight launch

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
obviously going to be midnight launch
for<00:01:33.920> advanced<00:01:34.920> warfare<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
for advanced warfare so it will kind of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
for advanced warfare so it will kind of
be<00:01:36.210> hard<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.020> midnight<00:01:37.380> launches<00:01:37.860> at

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
be hard to do to midnight launches at

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
be hard to do to midnight launches at
the<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.360> november<00:01:39.840> fourth<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the same time so november fourth is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289
