have here we have a pose a position
that's<00:05:36.389> similar<00:05:36.569> to<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.500> Philidor<00:05:38.270> right

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
that's similar to the Philidor right

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.249 
that's similar to the Philidor right
where<00:05:40.469> the<00:05:41.069> king<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.669> protecting<00:05:42.569> the<00:05:42.899> square
