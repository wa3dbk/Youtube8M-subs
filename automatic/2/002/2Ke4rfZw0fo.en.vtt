00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 video and this is about one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.400
 Comparison for a quality comparison 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.410
 and a comparison of image quality 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.940
 between two cameras and even if it is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.650
 At first glance something out of the ordinary 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 I can now compare the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.160
 picture quality of these two cameras that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 is once the old, so to speak, ricoh gr 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.890
 and once the new sony 6000 being the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 Essential and I believe the result 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 will also result in running or running 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.309
 on it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's more about the quality of the optics 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:45.500
 I have here the sony 2820 mm and the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.110
 is very close to the rico 18 3 millimeters 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 28 which is firmly installed here 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.430
 The sony is of course 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.930
 an interchangeable lens and because the sensor 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
 the same size is in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.789
 both cases around an aps c sensor 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.909
 Both cameras are relatively compact 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.040
 Of course, the ricoh da bird 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.720
 shoots 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.200
 I think that is still one of the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.299
 most compact aps c sensor cameras it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 in the market 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.890
 and frankly there the ricoh 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 much older than the sony had 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.740
 i expect a benefit from sony too 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 Find 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.650
 that should not go against sony now 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.790
 I am now a big fan 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.430
 with the 7s I had and the a72 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 I have and also find the a 6000 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.549
 I have a fantastic camera 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.090
 she offers a lot but see 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.040
 even 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.530
 and I really have the test yet 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.299
 repeated a few times because I was with the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.240
 result not really convinced me 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.860
 Show yourself now for a short time the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 Comparison I have recordings so 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 always made at 100 iso and manual 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.619
 so I'm really comparable 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.270
 I had the camera parameter 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.230
 directly next to each other 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.090
 lichtverhältnisse 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.620
 stayed the same and now we look 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.250
 look at the comparison 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:20.450
 between the results once 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.640
 Aperture 28 we enlarge now 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.540
 on the right you see that is the result of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.290
 the ricoh on the left you see the result 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.900
 from the sony and now we zoom in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.170
 bit in and the focus was in 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.370
 both cases on this area and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.530
 although of course by the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.110
 different number of megapixels 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.760
 the proportions distorted a bit 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.520
 are 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.080
 it is impressive and I am something 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.180
 surprised that the ricoh mine 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.530
 see how I recognize that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.240
 clearly sharper impression and makes 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.730
 not a bit sharper but 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.260
 I think much sharper so 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.040
 especially if you are looking up here now 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.380
 in the area of ​​this window or also 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.790
 Well, like the bricks here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.390
 being represented 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.760
 it is really impressive and 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.440
 a little surprising for mine 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.550
 So there are no concepts 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.319
 area where the sony is much better 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.500
 Maybe it's a bit down here 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.240
 but that's not really the same thing 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.920
 focal point I have the test 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.780
 again repeated with manual focus 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.040
 to be sure that it is not 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.240
 No problem with focusing 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:47.760
 and if we do the test again 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:52.890
 have repeated with one with 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.290
 56 blind at both and now we go 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.940
 again in the comparison pure so you 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.780
 See here the setting 1 25 seconds 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.130
 Shade 56 and iso 100 and if we are now 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.950
 Zoom in here 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:13.170
 then we have the sony one 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.140
 slightly improved impression what the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.979
 sharpness but the focus on the 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.630
 eco is still sensationally good 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.360
 Of course you can see it here 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.150
 background, it will be synonymous with the sharpness 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.820
 in the case of the focal length of 18 3 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.290
 millimeters are 5.6 already pretty good 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.390
 which makes the depth of field funnier 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.389
 Wise as I do not often see that 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:44.529
 Ricoh does not have one 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.449
 filter no antialiasing filter and here 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.139
 you see a bit of marie effects 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.449
 that's the one you see at the sony now 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.069
 not only that's what it's about now 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.809
 not synonymous but just about the order 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.930
 the sharpness and I really have to 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:05.229
 say I am a little surprised that the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:09.069
 never so clearly behind the ricoh 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:12.610
 is again for comparison, the two 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:18.129
 sony pictures next to each other and indeed 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:21.339
 this and this one again to 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.199
 Really see that too 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.809
 improvement already there is not mine 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.029
 this is clearly recognizable here 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:32.649
 it sharpens on the right side where that 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:34.839
 where the aperture is at 56 but somehow 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.399
 Surprisingly, not like you 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:41.680
 that or not as sharp as that 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:43.930
 should be expected thought my 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.939
 conclusion from that is it lies 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.789
 Unfortunately, the objectively what 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.529
 not known to be incredibly hot 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.020
 is 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:55.360
 and in return, the ricoh applies 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.709
 objectively as really exceptional 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.479
 creates all the files are so far 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.800
 No post- processing no sharpening 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.339
 you could do something here 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 sharpen 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:07.509
 but it was about the fundamental 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.830
 determine quality 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:14.469
 and there the result is pretty 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.809
 clearly that is not a fundamental 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.219
 negative reviews of the sony i believe 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.139
 Neither is it the camera view 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:24.969
 But I believe that it is at the 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:29.139
 Optics are one can say firmly built 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:32.110
 Lenses are always a bit sharper though 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.770
 In this case as I said I was something 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.650
 surprised 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.659
 The ricoh is much older than plain 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.180
 older than the sony i mean the ricoh 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:44.770
 is 34 years old that it is in sensors 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.830
 that's a certain age 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.919
 a certain age the sony is from 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.360
 So last year, that's it 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.189
 Latest what's up there 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.340
 i hope i could give you a little one 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.740
 give an insight into this in this topic 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.330
 in the topic of quality maybe too 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.000
 for one or the other one 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.340
 Decision support if you are now with 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.610
 the fixed focal length can survive 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.729
 the ricoh is still an absolute one 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.830
 Purchase recommendation and I am still 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.300
 very happy with it and then as said then 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.849
 just comes to just for 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.819
 street photography or so small the 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:23.770
 Sony is also and compact with the Ricoh 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.479
 which really disappears in one hand 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.860
 This chamber is sensational I am 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.219
 still very very happy 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.199
 in order to 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:34.229
 yes, I wish you all a nice 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:36.339
 I hope I see you soon 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:39.279
 subscribe to the channel if you want 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:43.889
 and if you want to see more and 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:43.889
 a wonderful day to all fans
