00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.050
 Today is muscle stupid, so today is Friday it's better to curve up 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 I think 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:16.350
 I was training to lift with the squat that day 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:22.590
 It's a pretty tight workout , so I curve up the day before the tight workout . 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.329
 Time to curve up at you have from about 24 to 12 hours Gras before before training 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.220
 From the day before 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.150
 I think it is important to bap 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.940
 so 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.860
 8 I usually take about 500g of water cargo, but when I bop the mother that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:44.040
 Over 100 grams to 200 grams 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:48.240
 I'm taking it, so there are times when it is quite hard to take other g cargo 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 So Toka, for example, cd r eat something like this 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:00.410
 It is already good She has a ring like that sport, but there was a good deal of water supply 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:04.070
 I lightly it other is do that only in the short-time system is taken drink the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.370
 It is ramen of this style that Americaza is this style 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:13.250
 There are a lot of errors and there are still ramen noodles here 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:19.970
 Quiet 1 good field's in what at the time of carbs up only of other raise its carbohydrate 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:27.140
 I'm doing it without raising lipids and proteins , I think it may be good rice 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:30.380
 I love curry and curry , I like it, but I like ice cream and this is the quality of it 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:37.010
 Captive mother this potato with Kuramano ice cream 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.960
 Fried potatoes are also fried in this room with fried potatoes in the oven and it's ah oil 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.450
 However, because the quality can be low, it is a pizza 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.350
 I eat such things with lacquer and do a carbo up 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.400
 so 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.980
 After all that mother-in-law 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 Can also lightly in in it out quite a force in the next day and curve up it training 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:05.230
 Such a tight training has a mother bop on the day before because it in such of 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:10.000
 What if you also carbohydrate carbohydrates without'm the protein 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:15.020
 How about giving 100 g to 200 g more than usual ? 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.900
 So I am curving up on friday and so on saturday 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.300
 I am doing a cab up so I am doing a slightly lighter curve up on monday 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.090
 Yes 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.660
 Although I did not know whether would be helpful 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.740

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.740
