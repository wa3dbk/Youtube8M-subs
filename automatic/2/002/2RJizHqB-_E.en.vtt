don't click on master volume and then go
down<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> master<00:00:36.870> tempo<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.070> I'll<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.850> like

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
down to master tempo and I'll just like

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.709 
down to master tempo and I'll just like
any<00:00:39.210> automation<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.790> it<00:00:41.790> works<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> same<00:00:42.450> so

okay so the metronomes on now and I put
I'll<00:01:08.680> show<00:01:08.980> you<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.730> tempo<00:01:10.180> change<00:01:10.480> by

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
I'll show you the tempo change by

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.350 
I'll show you the tempo change by
clicking<00:01:10.690> on<00:01:11.020> projects<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.910> you<00:01:12.910> now<00:01:13.030> see<00:01:13.240> now

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
clicking on projects and you now see now

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.230 
clicking on projects and you now see now
you'll<00:01:13.630> now<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.350> says<00:01:14.500> Auto<00:01:15.240> whereas

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
you'll now see that it says Auto whereas

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.880 
you'll now see that it says Auto whereas
before<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.600> didn't<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.020> means<00:01:17.320> it's<00:01:17.710> been

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
before it didn't this means it's been

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:34.190 
before it didn't this means it's been
alternated<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.210> if<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.420> listen<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:19.870> now

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.380 

and<00:01:35.200> that's<00:01:35.650> how<00:01:35.830> you<00:01:35.890> automate<00:01:36.400> unchanged

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
and that's how you automate unchanged

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.090 
and that's how you automate unchanged
tempo<00:01:37.930> midway<00:01:38.350> through<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.619> track<00:01:38.890> in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
tempo midway through a track in

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.040 
tempo midway through a track in
GarageBand<00:01:39.760> as<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.420> see<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.780> went<00:01:40.960> from

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
GarageBand as you can see it went from

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.280 
GarageBand as you can see it went from
120<00:01:41.440> BPM<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.700> 180

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290
