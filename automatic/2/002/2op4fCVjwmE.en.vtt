00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello my dear spectator there I am 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.690
 again with a new tutorial and indeed 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.030
 today civilian trucks first of all one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.830
 big big thank you goes to kd 2000 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 server has made it possible with that here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.099
 to make such wonderful tunnels because 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 honestly the money for this 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.140
 I would not have any vehicles either 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 thank you first times for let's look 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.080
 the whole truck to what do we have 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.100
 He is the first to stand here, as he does by the way 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.689
 I did it because of this 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.859
 pitch dark and damn hard 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.019
 to organize everything here 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.010
 once and then have a nice day too 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 but I think it has something 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 here with the light in the totally cool out ok 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.020
 now it's up here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.010
 because normal truck then we have the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.170
 trucker boxer then the tender transporter 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.890
 tobacco transporter covered for helmut 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.829
 transporters and those about divine 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 Helmut van with half shit 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 freighter container on it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.370
 explosive rocket transporters that are 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.600
 all the vehicles you see here 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 Of course, civilian driving is allowed only with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.239
 the truck license and does not see that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 sowing about epic you do not see it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.510
 totally cool from the night vision device 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.950
 Everything is clear on this as well, we'll take a look 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.330
 again against the cupboard of hers 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 vehicle we catch here with the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.000
 smallest vehicle have here 200 so 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.830
 if even one if then sat 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.420
 I could then titillate 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 snort sv down the offroader 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 Bars with 65 I believe and here the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.650
 first day already 200 civilian cars 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.479
 then the truck is worth the change 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 here with covers we have 150 that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.210
 a little bit smaller anyway 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.810
 that sit the saueromisch that I would have 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 not thought too 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
 I always thought that we were the smallest 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 and the next largest but still 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 so small think run bas is here 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.990
 this truck little whatsoever 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.390
 well then we would have the next one here 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 tobacco with 450 without cover so open 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 Tobacco with cover 350 understand 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.759
 Once the cover is on it it is there 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.200
 less space but you are protected 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.850
 when the back sits on the loading area 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 but because there is a squat here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.950
 no topic at all and that happens 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.570
 example and now you are natural 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.469
 visible from the outside so well 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.420
 be slammed 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.979
 it is with this film about it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.390
 of course, not so that is the correct reading 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.080
 it is also exposed to the dangers 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.450
 his main reason 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.530
 why less space but safer and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.430
 you have to be that too 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.230
 Vehicles also like as 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.400
 troop carriers are used yes 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.959
 So do not be surprised so gentleman witt has 550 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.870
 without cover now with 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.569
 shipping container behind 1000 so 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.530
 the bomb I would say yes 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.760
 otherwise from the speed ago 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.430
 get along with all of these hits somehow 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.690
 you want to drive your cocaine times 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.319
 hour one indeed the partial very long from 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.640
 I can find the driving experience here 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.830
 the most difficult mobile phone to control 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.190
 because he is eternally long and very much too 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.690
 The transporters are completely in 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.530
 order are but really shit house 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.000
 and heat pickups are quite nice though 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.709
 all around kavala cover the used everything 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.930
 other in my opinion nonsense 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.480
 if you still have questions about this 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.850
 tutorial or generally especially tutorials 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.290

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.090
 grein for this summer and see if 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.200
 I no, of course that was not me 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.910
 a nice overview can give about 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.400
 the vehicles exactly from the right 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.560
 Left you see what we anything is possible 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.150
