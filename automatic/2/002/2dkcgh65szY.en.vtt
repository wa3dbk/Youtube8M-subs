00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
does have the potential to look like a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
does have the potential to look like a
mess<00:01:40.999> so<00:01:41.999> that<00:01:42.749> being<00:01:42.990> said<00:01:43.249> another<00:01:44.249> question

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
was would you build one with drawers and

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.129 
was would you build one with drawers and
I<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.880> build<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.179> with<00:01:48.450> drawers<00:01:48.749> it's<00:01:48.990> just

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
I would build one with drawers it's just

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.499 
I would build one with drawers it's just
I<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.530> want<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.670> involved<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I didn't want to get that involved and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
I didn't want to get that involved and
it's<00:01:51.659> such<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> big<00:01:52.469> project<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it's such a big project because that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
it's such a big project because that
would<00:01:53.609> be<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> lot<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.179> drawers<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.350> there's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
would be a lot of drawers and there's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
would be a lot of drawers and there's
also<00:01:55.889> an<00:01:56.189> issue<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.659> area<00:01:58.109> up<00:01:58.319> here

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
also an issue with this area up here

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.389 
also an issue with this area up here
because<00:01:59.569> you<00:02:00.569> probably<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:01.859> point<00:02:02.100> are

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
because you probably at some point are

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
because you probably at some point are
going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> want<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.909> nightstand<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.719> some<00:02:04.020> kind

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
going to want a nightstand or some kind

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
going to want a nightstand or some kind
of<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.319> table<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.479> prevent

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
of a table here and that would prevent

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.210 
of a table here and that would prevent
the<00:02:07.020> drawer<00:02:07.289> from<00:02:07.499> opening<00:02:07.889> so<00:02:08.039> that's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the drawer from opening so that's

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.350 
the drawer from opening so that's
something<00:02:08.429> I'm<00:02:08.700> thinking<00:02:08.729> about

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
something I'm thinking about

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.820 
something I'm thinking about
I<00:02:10.100> probably<00:02:11.100> will<00:02:11.490> make<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.480> son<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:13.470> or<00:02:13.620> two

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I probably will make my son one or two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730 
I probably will make my son one or two
night<00:02:14.370> side<00:02:14.640> tables<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.319> nice<00:02:16.500> thing

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
night side tables because the nice thing

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.190 
night side tables because the nice thing
about<00:02:16.770> making<00:02:17.459> some<00:02:17.700> stuff<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.510> children

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
about making some stuff for my children

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.250 
about making some stuff for my children
now<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.500> they're<00:02:19.680> older<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.140> they

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
now is they're older I think that they

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
now is they're older I think that they
can<00:02:22.319> really<00:02:22.800> appreciate<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.370> furniture<00:02:23.970> that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
can really appreciate the furniture that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
can really appreciate the furniture that
my<00:02:24.810> son<00:02:25.080> Jack<00:02:25.110> was<00:02:26.100> saying<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.730> great

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
my son Jack was saying this is great

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
my son Jack was saying this is great
this<00:02:27.060> he'll<00:02:27.240> take<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.450> with<00:02:27.750> him<00:02:27.959> whenever<00:02:28.530> he

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
this he'll take it with him whenever he

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.820 
this he'll take it with him whenever he
leaves<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.220> house

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
leaves the house

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.850 
leaves the house
I'm<00:02:29.860> pushing<00:02:30.250> about<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.610> door<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:32.020> that's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
I'm pushing about the door but so that's

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.160 
I'm pushing about the door but so that's
kind<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.160> kind<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.880> nice<00:02:34.090> things<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.020> I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
kind of kind of a nice things and I

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.240 
kind of kind of a nice things and I
think<00:02:35.230> also<00:02:35.730> whenever<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.940> build<00:02:37.270> something

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
think also whenever you build something

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.860 
think also whenever you build something
your<00:02:39.250> second<00:02:39.610> attempt<00:02:39.970> will<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.270> better<00:02:40.480> so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
your second attempt will be better so

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.440 
your second attempt will be better so
I'm<00:02:41.530> not<00:02:41.890> sure<00:02:42.160> exactly<00:02:42.460> how<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.880> would<00:02:43.150> change

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
I'm not sure exactly how I would change

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.170 
I'm not sure exactly how I would change
this<00:02:43.690> I'm<00:02:43.870> pretty<00:02:44.290> happy<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.770> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
this I'm pretty happy with it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.540 
this I'm pretty happy with it
which<00:02:46.180> brings<00:02:46.510> me<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.810> another<00:02:46.840> question<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:48.520> I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
which brings me to another question do I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.600 
which brings me to another question do I
wish<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.390> was<00:02:49.510> easier<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.610> disassemble

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
wish that it was easier to disassemble

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.660 
wish that it was easier to disassemble
and<00:02:51.820> reassemble<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.630> bed<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.950> platform<00:02:54.520> and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
and reassemble the bed the platform and

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.900 
and reassemble the bed the platform and
yeah<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.150> would<00:02:55.300> be<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:56.410> would<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.770> nice<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.610> it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
yeah it would be it would be nice but it

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.350 
yeah it would be it would be nice but it
would<00:02:58.120> be<00:02:58.540> difficult<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.500> guess<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:01.030> figure

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
would be difficult I guess to figure

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.410 
would be difficult I guess to figure
that<00:03:01.510> one<00:03:01.570> out<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.210> think

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
that one out and I I don't know I think

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.390 
that one out and I I don't know I think
I'm<00:03:04.690> happy<00:03:05.020> with<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.650> way<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.950> came<00:03:05.980> out

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
I'm happy with with the way it came out

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.980 
I'm happy with with the way it came out
so<00:03:07.200> let's<00:03:08.200> see<00:03:08.320> what<00:03:08.440> else<00:03:08.590> we<00:03:08.709> got<00:03:08.860> here<00:03:09.990> till

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
so let's see what else we got here till

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.990 
so let's see what else we got here till
we<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> chance<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:12.130> get<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.340> chance<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.760> see

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
we get a chance we get a chance to see

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.420 
we get a chance we get a chance to see

because we had another big snowstorm
here<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.600> think<00:03:35.350> Thursday<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:38.410> Beast

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
here on I think Thursday and the Beast

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.979 
here on I think Thursday and the Beast
you<00:03:39.190> know<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.030> tough<00:03:40.269> winter<00:03:40.570> and

you know it's a it's a tough winter and
so<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.650> took<00:03:41.709> some<00:03:42.010> footage<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.910> Beehive

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.880 
so I took some footage of the Beehive
and<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.750> don't<00:03:44.019> know<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.410> these<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:44.830> to

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
and I don't know that these are going to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.199 
and I don't know that these are going to
make<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.220> through<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> am<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.090> make

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
make it through I am going to make

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.000 
make it through I am going to make
another<00:03:46.480> beehive<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.080> about<00:03:47.290> two<00:03:47.500> weeks<00:03:47.769> and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
another beehive in about two weeks and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.940 
another beehive in about two weeks and
what<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.550> do<00:03:48.640> all<00:03:48.940> have<00:03:49.090> plans<00:03:49.450> on<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.950> website

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
what I do all have plans on the website

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.430 
what I do all have plans on the website
that<00:03:51.370> you'll<00:03:51.610> be<00:03:51.730> able<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.120> pull<00:03:52.690> over<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.140> it

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
that you'll be able to pull over and it

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.320 
that you'll be able to pull over and it
should<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.769> it's<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> pretty<00:03:54.340> easy<00:03:54.550> build<00:03:54.970> I've

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
should be it's a pretty easy build I've

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.180 
should be it's a pretty easy build I've
changed<00:03:55.989> design<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.410> little<00:03:56.620> bit<00:03:56.769> from<00:03:57.010> last

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
changed design a little bit from last

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.790 
changed design a little bit from last
year<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.959> yeah<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:58.989> hope<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.290> bees<00:03:59.470> made<00:03:59.680> it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
year so yeah I hope the bees made it

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.479 
year so yeah I hope the bees made it
through<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> lot<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.700> us<00:04:01.230> beekeepers<00:04:02.230> are

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
through a lot of us beekeepers are

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.290 
through a lot of us beekeepers are
concerned<00:04:03.489> because<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.940> been<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.090> pretty

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
concerned because it's been a pretty

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.120 
concerned because it's been a pretty
rough<00:04:04.540> winter<00:04:05.850> okay<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:07.090> got<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> question<00:04:07.690> about

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
rough winter okay I got a question about

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.199 
rough winter okay I got a question about
the<00:04:09.130> turbine<00:04:09.790> sprayer<00:04:10.330> an<00:04:10.600> HVLP<00:04:11.290> sprayer

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the turbine sprayer an HVLP sprayer

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.060 
the turbine sprayer an HVLP sprayer
spraying<00:04:13.209> lacquer<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.930> probably<00:04:14.500> one<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.860> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
spraying lacquer is probably one of the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.990 
spraying lacquer is probably one of the
easiest<00:04:15.580> easiest<00:04:15.810> finishes<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.260> get<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.220> it's

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
easiest easiest finishes to get it it's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.900 
easiest easiest finishes to get it it's
just<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.540> very<00:04:19.840> user<00:04:20.169> friendly<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:21.040> think<00:04:21.370> that

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
just a very user friendly I think that

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.330 
just a very user friendly I think that
if<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.350> use<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> ratio<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:25.710> three<00:04:26.710> parts<00:04:27.160> or

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
if you use a ratio of three parts or

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.370 
if you use a ratio of three parts or
what<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.760> three<00:04:27.910> quarters<00:04:28.210> lacquer<00:04:29.020> and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
what is it three quarters lacquer and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.530 
what is it three quarters lacquer and
one<00:04:29.590> quarter<00:04:29.860> lacquer<00:04:30.280> thinner<00:04:30.640> you'll<00:04:31.330> have

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
one quarter lacquer thinner you'll have

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.060 
one quarter lacquer thinner you'll have
decent<00:04:31.990> results<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.800> with<00:04:32.919> any

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
decent results and really with any

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.740 
decent results and really with any
finish<00:04:33.460> you're<00:04:33.610> better<00:04:33.760> off<00:04:33.820> with<00:04:34.120> several

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
finish you're better off with several

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.320 
finish you're better off with several
thin<00:04:35.140> coats<00:04:35.440> as<00:04:35.680> opposed<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.460> few<00:04:36.850> thick

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
thin coats as opposed to a few thick

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.260 
thin coats as opposed to a few thick
coats<00:04:38.130> my<00:04:39.130> problem<00:04:39.520> right<00:04:39.550> now<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:39.940> I'm<00:04:40.030> really

not
up<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.979> spray<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.639> usually<00:04:42.300> spray<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
up to spray I usually spray in the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.210 
up to spray I usually spray in the
corner<00:04:43.169> over<00:04:43.260> there<00:04:43.500> which<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> mess<00:04:44.100> right

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
corner over there which is a mess right

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.920 
corner over there which is a mess right
now<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.760> I'm<00:04:45.060> kind<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.419> waiting<00:04:45.600> for<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
now and I'm kind of waiting for the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.409 
now and I'm kind of waiting for the
weather<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.260> break<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:47.010> move<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.060> welder

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
weather to break to move the welder

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.330 
weather to break to move the welder
outside<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.199> don't<00:04:49.440> weld<00:04:49.650> in<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:49.949> but<00:04:50.130> my

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
outside I don't weld in here but my

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.240 
outside I don't weld in here but my
welder<00:04:50.669> is<00:04:50.790> stored<00:04:51.090> over<00:04:51.389> there<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.040> set<00:04:53.040> that

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
welder is stored over there and set that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.070 
welder is stored over there and set that
area<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:53.970> can<00:04:54.120> start<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.479> spray<00:04:54.750> more<00:04:54.930> and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
area so I can start to spray more and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.909 
area so I can start to spray more and
then<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.290> overall<00:04:55.979> goal<00:04:56.400> is<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.970> expand<00:04:57.960> onto

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
then the overall goal is to expand onto

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.740 
then the overall goal is to expand onto
that<00:04:59.520> side<00:04:59.850> of<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> barn<00:05:00.300> where<00:05:00.479> I<00:05:00.540> have<00:05:00.720> a

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
that side of the barn where I have a

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.790 
that side of the barn where I have a
shed<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.490> then<00:05:02.490> spring<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.090> there<00:05:03.620> do<00:05:04.620> ever

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
shed and then spring in there do ever

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.620 
shed and then spring in there do ever
wear<00:05:05.040> ear<00:05:05.310> protection<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:06.000> always<00:05:06.300> wear<00:05:06.449> ear

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
wear ear protection I always wear ear

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.900 
wear ear protection I always wear ear
protection<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.530> I<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.160> don't<00:05:08.370> point<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.760> out

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
protection and I just don't point it out

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.180 
protection and I just don't point it out
I<00:05:09.150> guess<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.630> don't<00:05:09.810> want<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.020> get<00:05:10.470> close-ups<00:05:10.979> of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
I guess I don't want to get close-ups of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.279 
I guess I don't want to get close-ups of
my<00:05:11.430> ears<00:05:11.729> but<00:05:12.650> one<00:05:13.650> thing<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:13.979> do<00:05:14.039> use<00:05:14.910> is<00:05:15.300> door

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
my ears but one thing I do use is door

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.040 
my ears but one thing I do use is door
insulation<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.970> don't<00:05:18.750> know<00:05:18.900> if<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.020> should

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
insulation and I don't know if I should

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.840 
insulation and I don't know if I should
recommend<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:20.010> it's<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.340> something<00:05:20.820> that

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
recommend this it's just something that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.480 
recommend this it's just something that
I<00:05:20.970> always<00:05:21.180> have<00:05:21.419> around<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.169> I've<00:05:22.620> always<00:05:23.280> got

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
I always have around so I've always got

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.450 
I always have around so I've always got
they<00:05:24.479> work<00:05:24.690> just<00:05:24.720> exactly<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.949> way<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.310> ear

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
they work just exactly the way the ear

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.330 
they work just exactly the way the ear
plug<00:05:26.729> does<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.900> never<00:05:28.560> seem<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.860> run<00:05:28.979> out<00:05:29.160> of

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
plug does and I never seem to run out of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.430 
plug does and I never seem to run out of
them<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.850> always<00:05:30.180> use<00:05:30.360> ear<00:05:31.020> protection

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
them but I always use ear protection

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.870 
them but I always use ear protection
especially<00:05:31.800> with<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.550> routers<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:35.520> belt

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
especially with the routers and the belt

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.439 
especially with the routers and the belt
sander<00:05:36.150> some<00:05:36.539> of<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.720> really<00:05:37.020> piercing<00:05:37.860> tools

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
sander some of the really piercing tools

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.480 
sander some of the really piercing tools
okay<00:05:39.449> how<00:05:39.990> much<00:05:40.169> did<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.470> materials<00:05:40.979> cost<00:05:41.250> for

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
okay how much did the materials cost for

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.960 
okay how much did the materials cost for
this<00:05:41.580> build<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:42.090> think<00:05:42.960> I'm<00:05:43.440> right<00:05:43.590> around<00:05:43.970> 225

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
this build I think I'm right around 225

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.690 
this build I think I'm right around 225
dollars<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.410> appealing<00:05:46.860> molding<00:05:47.430> and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
dollars with this appealing molding and

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.820 
dollars with this appealing molding and
it<00:05:48.150> probably<00:05:48.840> would<00:05:48.960> go<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.139> little<00:05:49.410> bit<00:05:49.620> over

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
it probably would go a little bit over

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.950 
it probably would go a little bit over
that<00:05:49.860> because<00:05:50.099> I<00:05:50.250> did<00:05:50.550> have<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:51.539> cherry

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
that because I did have the cherry

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.779 
that because I did have the cherry
veneer<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.740> had<00:05:52.919> some<00:05:53.130> things<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.550> shop

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
veneer so I had some things in the shop

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.529 
veneer so I had some things in the shop
but<00:05:54.590> yeah<00:05:55.590> it's<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.789> had<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.150> spend<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.419> little

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
but yeah it's I had to spend a little

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.529 
but yeah it's I had to spend a little
bit<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.840> money<00:05:57.990> on<00:05:58.200> this<00:05:58.320> project<00:05:59.510> well<00:06:00.510> I

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
bit of money on this project well I

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.839 
bit of money on this project well I
guess<00:06:00.720> that's<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:01.950> do<00:06:02.010> just<00:06:02.639> want<00:06:02.789> to

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
guess that's it and I do just want to
