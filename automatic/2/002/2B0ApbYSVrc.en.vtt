in<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.370> recent<00:00:05.730> review<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.120> talked<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.750> how

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
in a recent review I talked about how

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.690 
in a recent review I talked about how
much<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.379> love<00:00:07.649> seeing<00:00:07.980> new<00:00:08.189> gameplay

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
much I love seeing new gameplay

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.879 
much I love seeing new gameplay
mechanics<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.750> new<00:00:09.900> console<00:00:10.410> launches

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
mechanics that new console launches

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.830 
mechanics that new console launches
allow<00:00:11.190> developers<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.000> implement<00:00:12.210> into<00:00:12.719> their

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
allow developers to implement into their

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.860 
allow developers to implement into their
games<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> racing<00:00:14.580> game<00:00:14.610> fan<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
games as a racing game fan one of the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.450 
games as a racing game fan one of the
other<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.440> look<00:00:16.650> forward<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> seeing

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
other things I look forward to is seeing

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.700 
other things I look forward to is seeing
the<00:00:17.850> sheer<00:00:18.119> speed<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.720> new<00:00:18.869> consoles<00:00:19.439> allow

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the sheer speed that new consoles allow

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.910 
the sheer speed that new consoles allow
developers<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> push<00:00:21.029> into<00:00:21.240> their<00:00:21.480> games

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
developers to push into their games

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.740 
developers to push into their games

was<00:00:27.269> convinced<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.230> few<00:00:28.500> games<00:00:28.830> would

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
was convinced that very few games would

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.800 
was convinced that very few games would
be<00:00:29.099> able<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> pump<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:30.000> such<00:00:30.300> an<00:00:30.480> insane

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
be able to pump out such an insane

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.590 
be able to pump out such an insane
amount<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.260> speed<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> console

amount of speed on the console

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
amount of speed on the console
thankfully<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.079> wrong<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.710> although

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
thankfully I was wrong and although

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
thankfully I was wrong and although
later<00:00:35.550> games<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.149> f-zero<00:00:36.690> X<00:00:36.989> proved<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
later games like f-zero X proved that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.340 
later games like f-zero X proved that
speed<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.160> no<00:00:38.370> issue<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> n64<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:40.200> was

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
speed was no issue for the n64 it was

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
also play much like roller coaster
tracks<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.930> uncommon<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> get

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
tracks and so it's not uncommon to get

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.330 
tracks and so it's not uncommon to get
loop-the-loops

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
loop-the-loops

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.999 
loop-the-loops
and<00:01:56.520> vertical<00:01:57.030> roads<00:01:57.299> while<00:01:57.750> playing<00:01:58.049> while

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and vertical roads while playing while

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
and vertical roads while playing while
the<00:01:59.040> textures<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> designs<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.600> good

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the textures and designs are all good

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
the textures and designs are all good
for<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.079> early<00:02:01.320> n64<00:02:01.950> release<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
for an early n64 release there is a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
for an early n64 release there is a
slight<00:02:03.390> layer<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> fogging<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
slight layer of fogging which on some of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
slight layer of fogging which on some of
the<00:02:05.040> later<00:02:05.250> tracks<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.299> cause<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the later tracks can really cause you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.980 
the later tracks can really cause you
problems

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.300 

another<00:02:09.990> slight<00:02:10.380> gripe<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> framerate

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
another slight gripe is the framerate

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.790 
another slight gripe is the framerate
whilst<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> remains<00:02:12.600> beautifully<00:02:13.230> fast<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
whilst it remains beautifully fast and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
whilst it remains beautifully fast and
refreshingly<00:02:14.190> solid<00:02:14.820> there<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.690> few

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
refreshingly solid there are just a few

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.230 
refreshingly solid there are just a few
instances<00:02:16.530> again<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> later<00:02:17.730> courses

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
instances again on the later courses

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210 
instances again on the later courses
where<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.960> console<00:02:19.350> just<00:02:19.500> can't<00:02:19.800> keep<00:02:20.010> up

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
where the console just can't keep up

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.950 
where the console just can't keep up
with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> action<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.570> are<00:02:21.720> moments

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
with the action and so there are moments

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.620 
with the action and so there are moments
where<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.320> frame<00:02:22.620> rate<00:02:22.830> does<00:02:23.070> dip<00:02:23.630> thankfully

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
where the frame rate does dip thankfully

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.330 
where the frame rate does dip thankfully
though<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> doesn't<00:02:25.170> ruin<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> game<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.250> if

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
though it doesn't ruin the game but if

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.740 
though it doesn't ruin the game but if
you've<00:02:26.430> hit<00:02:26.580> your<00:02:26.640> top<00:02:27.000> speed<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.570> then<00:02:27.660> the

you've hit your top speed and then the

you've hit your top speed and then the
framerate<00:02:28.020> drops<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.190> throw<00:02:29.370> off<00:02:29.400> your
