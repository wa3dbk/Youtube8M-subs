here today it's something that's a bit
different<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.280> also<00:02:33.400> means<00:02:33.730> there's<00:02:33.909> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
different but it also means there's a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.880 
different but it also means there's a
