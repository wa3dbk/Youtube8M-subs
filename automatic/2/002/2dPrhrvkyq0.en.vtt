in<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.489> WNBA<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.060> was<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> fan<00:04:06.479> of<00:04:06.510> Alex<00:04:06.840> Riley

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
in the WNBA I was a fan of Alex Riley

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.960 
in the WNBA I was a fan of Alex Riley
I<00:04:07.379> thought<00:04:08.010> his<00:04:08.190> feud<00:04:08.459> with<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.609> Miz<00:04:08.849> was

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.189 
I thought his feud with the Miz was
awesome<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.569> think<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.870> he<00:04:09.989> could<00:04:10.109> have

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
awesome and I think that he could have

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.039 
awesome and I think that he could have
got<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.530> lot<00:04:11.250> more<00:04:11.280> mileage<00:04:11.639> on<00:04:11.879> Alex<00:04:12.239> Riley<00:04:12.479> but
