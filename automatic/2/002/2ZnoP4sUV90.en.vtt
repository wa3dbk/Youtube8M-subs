I<00:00:00.199> sort<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.290> knew<00:00:01.530> when<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.370> came<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:03.030> and

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
I sort of knew when I came here and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.519 
I sort of knew when I came here and
Champions<00:00:04.140> League<00:00:05.540> Liverpool<00:00:06.540> our<00:00:06.810> Arsenal<00:00:07.350> I

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Champions League Liverpool our Arsenal I

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.410 
Champions League Liverpool our Arsenal I
thought<00:00:08.010> maybe<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.700> them<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.179> draw

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
thought maybe one of them we were draw

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.129 
thought maybe one of them we were draw
and<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.559> Arsenal<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.190> think<00:00:11.809> one<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and it is Arsenal I think one of the the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.820 
and it is Arsenal I think one of the the
toughest<00:00:13.799> teams<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> draw<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.619> I<00:00:16.619> think

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
toughest teams in the draw and I think

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.370 
toughest teams in the draw and I think
it<00:00:16.949> will<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.390> very<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.480> difficult<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.140> our

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
it will be very very difficult for our

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.910 
it will be very very difficult for our
players<00:00:19.699> but<00:00:20.699> also<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.090> great<00:00:21.300> experience<00:00:21.920> we

the Arsenal players and they watch them
Premier<00:01:39.869> League<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
Premier League I think they are one of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.109 
Premier League I think they are one of
the<00:01:42.090> top<00:01:42.329> teams<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.810> Europe<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.000> be

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the top teams in Europe and it will be

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
the top teams in Europe and it will be
good<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.600> players<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> play<00:01:46.229> against

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
good for our players to play against

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.210 
good for our players to play against
that<00:01:47.009> quality<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.920> anything<00:01:49.920> after<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that quality because anything after that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.270 
that quality because anything after that
maybe<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.479> easier<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
maybe a little easier you have a very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
maybe a little easier you have a very
talented<00:01:53.520> group<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> lot

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
talented group but they don't have a lot

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.469

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
it going to be a problem

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.260
