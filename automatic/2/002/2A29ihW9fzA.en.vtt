00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello people today I will teach you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 make a page and green equal to those 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 from cafeteria and restaurant 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 only the coolest one we will 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 make one that does not need gold then 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 it will be super easy to do very fast 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.949
 come on as an ingredient that people 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 going to need is going to be a box of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.260
 cream that goes more or less 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 200 ml of those in serum 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.119
 half lemon 1 garlic clove already peeled 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 but it has to be so smaller you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 find a very little one even a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 Sprig of basil may also be 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 parsley and chives 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 leave a stronger taste but instead 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 of your preference I prefer maize 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.750
 even a teaspoon of mustard 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.340
 gazprom of the times that we buy in the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 Market has no problem 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.520
 hence we will use more or less 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 plus 150 ml of oil oil will go 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.149
 more or less this amount of people 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.340
 will see when it's time to make a point 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.780
 give a little pink pepper too 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 can be violent from the river if you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.630
 prefer and salt to taste good to prepare 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 this recipe is super simple and fast 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.650
 first that I 'm putting all the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 ingredients in the blender 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 - the oil that will be in the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.409
 where we took the car but the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.180
 rest the rest of the ingredients you 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.939
 can put everything in the blender 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 it 's just that he has two things to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.640
 first is that depending on your 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 blender 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 it will do a little dirt because 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 Are not we going to use that one? 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.689
 hole in the middle of the cap will not catch the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.549
 chapter will give a bit of dirt if 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 take care of the clothes you have 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 Where are you doing? 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 and the second is the point of the majority 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 Super fast we have to pay 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.560
 much attention because if you pass from the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.350
 point will ruin it will be a little 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
 hard to get back to the right spot but 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.970
 anything without fear of going back just use 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.409
 have patience too 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 now champion beating everyone 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.090
 ingredients in a blender and the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.569
 Now, people are going to put the olive oil 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.640
 How do I say I'm really careful now? 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:05.490
 now just put the olive oil as if 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.009
 was a continuous strand of olive oil can not 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
 stop until the point is reached and also the point 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 It will be when we could not 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 breathe the blender blades and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.160
 also get a creamier 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.170
 good staff my mother that they arrived 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 at the right point this is what you are 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.510
 watching video the point it has to be 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.940
 then you just put it in a pot of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 glass or one can you have what you have 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.319
 that being with which it covers very well is that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.709
 leave well capped and leave in the refrigerator 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.420
 Until the time you use it, you have 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.150
 I like to see how super easy it is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.549
