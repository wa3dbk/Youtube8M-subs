00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi friends and still not answer and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.529
 we keep trying to do something 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.960
 we try to learn and play with balls 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.480
 these such found quite tasty bases 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
 lure the wolf lowly will not work though 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.190
 I think 2 balls worth trying 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 let's do it with two balls though 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 there and queens to but essentially from there 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.130
 falls out in the frenzy of the zone before all the same 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 there is something unfortunately set 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.769
 can you do a very broad principle to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.619
 lure out 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.599
 and the clever special will start so much 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 start the attack from here brought you to 2 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.149
 lava and ball like a path around the perimeter 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.489
 We throw so as someone leaves a bunch of a bunch of 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.559
 archers learn it was not so scary 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.710
 would there be a lot of magicians it looks like in my 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.110
 scary so here before here it is all 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.180
 It seems to be great in fact guys 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 the gift here I will definitely take away why I 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 so decided yes because near dark she 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.660
 for two crossbows and when the balls will be there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 take it so to speak and they obviously hook 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.539
 this warehouse with oil and all this at 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 as surely take it so yeah not touched 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.070
 why zodiac lacquer has become 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.770
 this one was just demolished along with the clang asses 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 which also ran raspberries oil so 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.280
 damn here is certainly a hill 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 come in handy because the sorcerer beats and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.030
 all beats and yes rather listened now 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 there they will soon fall to pieces 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 because they are pretty patted 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.159
 in my opinion yes yes unfortunately still these 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 Archers interfere I hope the balls 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.700
 who will be killed by sorcerers 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.799
 and archer tower 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.930
 they fall down carry this one group 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.970
 can yachts again you failed 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.300
 so now there will be all hope for 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.300
 heroes 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.730
 so well, like yes, heroes from the time to spit 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 although as threads for a king it is small 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.690
 problems because they cost him go 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.010
 behind the fence will have to turn it on 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.500
 ability because you 're pretty 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.790
 heavily battered let buy buy leave 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.130
 especially they themselves were gigantic 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.210
 fillings i hope i think i wouldn't 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.790
 managed to cover well yes somehow not 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.710
 Especially all successfully dry goes in general I do not 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.480
 I know how much it will turn out to collect warehouses I 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.520
 I will try to pick up take all 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.340
 vegetables if possible if the hour queens 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320
 helped then till the king would have survived but 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.890
 so its just the enemy queen 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.410
 shot 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.570
 sad sad but been so come on 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 an hour to be a small duel between my 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.100
 queens and rival so i will say 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 turn on the ability and dropping the queens to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.060
 per minute will take as much as you can 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.850
 although Lynn see on the right of the tower you will not 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 worth the food on starts to get out 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.740
 Now queens to do it in an intelligent 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.560
 will go to the left gold vault on 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.910
 it will be just a wizard if she goes to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.290
 bonfire or towers society will all be 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.830
 bad of course 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.709
 what was expected of them to 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.989
 sorry goodbye queens to you pretty 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.580
 not bad thread served but the last 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.340
 archers saved by an arrow 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.440
 and my queen was killed well , okay, guys, we 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.900
 only we train on the idea of oil we 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.150
 taken away normally and in principle the second 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 part on such balls plus words 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.480
 went pretty well good luck to you guys 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 and see you soon
