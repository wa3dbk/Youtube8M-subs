yeah<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:58.100> settings<00:04:58.400> i'm<00:04:58.520> using<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:58.940> ultra<00:04:59.690> on

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
yeah the settings i'm using is ultra on

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.200 
yeah the settings i'm using is ultra on
everything<00:05:00.530> or<00:05:00.770> basically<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.610> highest<00:05:01.970> i

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
everything or basically the highest i

guess it doesn't lag at all even with
recording<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.810> without
