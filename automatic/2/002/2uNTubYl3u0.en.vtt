00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.180
 the screen naturally take up practically 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.000
 the entire front panel is located under it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.920
 very convenient on the display there

 LED for alerts and sensors 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.410
 approximation of the sacred on the top 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.979
 located in the connector on the left side 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.560
 there is a micro sd connector on the bottom there is nothing 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.320
 and finally on the right side as many as three buttons

 volume and camera power key 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.189
 this way to see all the main 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.689
 manufacturer controls introduced 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.700
 exactly on the right panel back panel 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 made and soft touch plastic so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 what will be comfortable in the hand and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 leave at least 5 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.640
 at the bottom there is a speaker speaker 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 connections 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.439
 logo highscreen top back 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.329
 The panel is located 8-megapixel 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.570
 camera which is to increase the focal length 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 distances somewhat protrudes from the panel 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.259
 LED flash and hole 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.320
 microphone by the way this model looks very 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.310
 similar to prestigio multiphone 4500 duo 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 there also stand the camera there there and not 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.939
 8 megapixel and corps 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.610
 the size is similar but the design of the smartphone 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.850
 prestige where are you all the more prestigious as 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.350
 No, the smartphone opens at the bottom you need 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.079
 just lift the back cover 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.569
 inside is a 2500 battery 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.380
 milliamp-hours and today smartphones 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.720
 this is the number itself 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.640
 on battery perhaps plus considering that it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.450
 hard working with just one sim card 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.320
 then the charge should be quiet enough for 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
 a day or two 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.670
 battery life is easily removed though 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.250
 it was not necessary to do it and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.230
 built to do at the expense of what else 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.090
 save in size how to do others 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.350
 manufacturers 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.240
 because a memory card and a sim card 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.330
 can be inserted without removing 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.920
 calculator by the way for some reason 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.980
 used micro sim card though 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.820
 the manufacturer could easily equip 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:49.190
 normal connectors cover closes and 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.190
 no squeaks and no backlash 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.799
 with such characteristics the spark is set aside 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.739
 Naturally showed and not bad 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.610
 test results antutu gave 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.090
 15 thousand one hundred sixty five points 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.829
 breaking out 496 points they are at mark fifty 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.810
 six and four which is quite at the level 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:21.780
 Naturally on the smartphone go fine 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.470
 any games so as we see highscreen 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.049
 explosion 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.269
 very powerful smartphone but true with 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.360
 not quite expressive design behind 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.730
 that price is only 400 dollars 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.860
