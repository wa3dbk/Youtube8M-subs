00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
where i was at and i guess some poker if
you're<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.580> tilt<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you're on tilt you gonna you know get a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
you're on tilt you gonna you know get a
tough<00:01:25.619> beat<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> play<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.850> looser

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
tough beat then you play a little looser

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
tough beat then you play a little looser
I<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.610> that's<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> only

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I don't know it's it's a that's the only

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
I don't know it's it's a that's the only
comparison<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> thinking<00:01:31.409> man's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
comparison I see it's a thinking man's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
comparison I see it's a thinking man's
game<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.549> takes<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> patience<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
game it takes a lot of patience which I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
game it takes a lot of patience which I
guess<00:01:33.930> tennis<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.619> patience<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
guess tennis take some patience but you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.920 
guess tennis take some patience but you
got<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> aggressive<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.900> mean

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
got to know when to be aggressive I mean

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
got to know when to be aggressive I mean
there<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.320> similarities<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.240> it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
there are some similarities but it's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
there are some similarities but it's
