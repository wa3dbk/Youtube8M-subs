00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
down and actually started this world

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.759 
down and actually started this world
here<00:02:46.609> so<00:02:47.569> from<00:02:47.690> there<00:02:47.959> I'm<00:02:48.109> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> drop<00:02:48.500> in

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
here so from there I'm going to drop in

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.520 
here so from there I'm going to drop in
and<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.459> guys<00:02:49.519> can<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.540> actually<00:02:51.319> have

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
and as you guys can see I actually have

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.440 
and as you guys can see I actually have
two<00:02:51.799> instances<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.640> Minecraft<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.120> open<00:02:53.329> and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
two instances of Minecraft to open and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.789 
two instances of Minecraft to open and
normally<00:02:53.569> you'd<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:54.079> like<00:02:54.200> well<00:02:54.290> Nick<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.650> is

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
normally you'd be like well Nick this is

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.699 
normally you'd be like well Nick this is
pretty<00:02:54.980> useless<00:02:55.400> considering<00:02:56.709> considering

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
pretty useless considering considering

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.949 
pretty useless considering considering
the<00:02:57.920> fact<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.609> well<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.510> know<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.690> can't

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the fact that well you know you can't

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.539 
the fact that well you know you can't
control<00:03:00.260> both<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.739> same<00:03:00.920> time<00:03:01.190> well<00:03:01.430> what

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
control both at the same time well what

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.099 
control both at the same time well what
this<00:03:01.730> mod<00:03:01.909> actually<00:03:02.120> allows<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.659> to<00:03:02.780> do<00:03:02.930> is

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
this mod actually allows you to do is

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.449 
this mod actually allows you to do is
I'm<00:03:03.200> going<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.379> turn<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.680> controller<00:03:04.129> on<00:03:04.310> this

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
I'm going to turn on controller on this

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.860 
I'm going to turn on controller on this
one<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.970> I'm<00:03:05.090> actually<00:03:05.209> going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> turn<00:03:05.659> off

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
one and I'm actually going to turn off

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.690 
one and I'm actually going to turn off
controller<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.099> so<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.370> controller

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
controller on this one so the controller

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.670 
controller on this one so the controller
will<00:03:07.909> no<00:03:08.060> longer<00:03:08.299> function<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.409> one<00:03:09.560> and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
will no longer function on this one and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.349 
will no longer function on this one and
it<00:03:09.799> would<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.129> be<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.670> mouse<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.180> keyboard

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
it would just be the mouse and keyboard

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.449 
it would just be the mouse and keyboard
so<00:03:11.629> as<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.900> guys<00:03:12.019> can<00:03:12.170> see<00:03:12.230> I'm<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.220> getting

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
so as you guys can see I'm not getting

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.130 
so as you guys can see I'm not getting
great<00:03:13.579> frames<00:03:13.970> they're<00:03:14.180> also<00:03:14.359> running<00:03:14.629> Sonic

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
great frames they're also running Sonic

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.470 
great frames they're also running Sonic
shaders<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:15.980> whenever<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> wasn't

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
shaders here so whenever when I wasn't

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.089 
shaders here so whenever when I wasn't
recording<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:18.079> was<00:03:18.139> getting<00:03:18.380> around<00:03:18.590> 200

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
recording I was getting around 200

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.640 
recording I was getting around 200
frames<00:03:19.280> now<00:03:19.549> I'm<00:03:19.669> getting<00:03:19.849> around<00:03:20.060> 15<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.470> keep

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
frames now I'm getting around 15 so keep

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.229 
frames now I'm getting around 15 so keep
that<00:03:21.799> in<00:03:21.950> mind<00:03:22.130> guys<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.549> I'm<00:03:22.609> also<00:03:22.760> filming

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
that in mind guys and I'm also filming

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.750 
that in mind guys and I'm also filming
at<00:03:23.389> 60fps<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.680> if<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.829> were<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.130> go<00:03:25.220> here<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
at 60fps but if I were to go here and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.270 
at 60fps but if I were to go here and
get<00:03:25.970> done<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.540> go<00:03:26.660> back<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.989> game<00:03:27.169> I<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:28.160> go

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
get done and go back to game I can go

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.949 
get done and go back to game I can go
over<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:28.639> and<00:03:28.760> then<00:03:28.849> from<00:03:29.389> there<00:03:29.599> I<00:03:29.780> can

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959

using<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:13.040> specific<00:04:13.639> modest<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.359> definitely

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
using this specific modest I definitely

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.939

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.550 
works pretty well and there's there's no
too<00:04:26.820> much<00:04:26.940> latency<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.600> whatnot<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.140> it's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
too much latency and whatnot and it's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
too much latency and whatnot and it's
pretty<00:04:28.830> cool<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.340> definitely<00:04:29.580> do<00:04:29.880> like<00:04:29.910> that
