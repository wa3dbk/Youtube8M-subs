00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.199
 with a new author ial of this series 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:22.260
 it's not going to be like this is not going to be like telling 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:25.420
 goodbye tutorials on pcpe 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.500
 we are here in how you see in the title 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 how to deliver 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.500
 12 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 The first thing to do also is to go to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.510
 link to the links that you leave to the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.510
 destruction 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 these links 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.680
 this and this is going to be to create one the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.680
 first milestone 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.330
 the missing program to create this is 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.060
 one that has to be carried for what it's worth 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.700
 put here also directly and a 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.160
 Once there they download everything they put the codes 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.290
 of half file it downloads codes that 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.729
 he's going to ask for them but base tells you 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.510
 they ask with the letters as they are here 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.159
 and this is going to come out of this 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.280
 and this look 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.159
 see here we solve them with the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.439
 four from here and they give him to be here and 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.299
 they are going to extract these and also they 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.399
 brings them this this is this one and this one 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.310
 then when I go they do not have extracted 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.450
 they put it here to the folder that one is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.690
 is going to be 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.490
 and the others because it is already 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.700
 good a video short the truth 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.700
 and now they are simply going to their psp 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.970
 direct and good some doubt then I 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.580
 they say 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.240
 but tell me 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.020
 I'm competent 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.410
 here they are going to copy the folders 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410
 of these 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.360
 here this is they give you copies and they go to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.750
