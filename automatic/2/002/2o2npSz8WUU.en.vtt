00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.760 

I<00:00:34.670> think<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.420> sense<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.810> exclusivity<00:00:37.200> but

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I think the sense of exclusivity but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.500 
I think the sense of exclusivity but
then<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> join<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.310> bunch<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.470> people<00:00:40.470> who<00:00:40.590> are

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
then you join a bunch of people who are

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.080 
then you join a bunch of people who are
you<00:00:42.510> know

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
you know

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.780 
you know
leaders<00:00:44.660> in<00:00:44.840> their<00:00:44.989> fields<00:00:45.290> or<00:00:45.410> some<00:00:45.530> way

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
leaders in their fields or some way

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.110 
leaders in their fields or some way
I<00:00:46.820> think<00:00:47.600> she<00:00:48.350> evening<00:00:48.620> gives<00:00:48.890> you<00:00:49.070> an<00:00:49.400> overall

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
I think she evening gives you an overall

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.680 
I think she evening gives you an overall
probably<00:00:53.120> more<00:00:54.100> self-realization<00:00:55.100> thing<00:00:55.340> and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
probably more self-realization thing and

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.090 
probably more self-realization thing and
at<00:00:56.690> least<00:00:56.900> with<00:00:57.080> this<00:00:57.260> course<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:57.710> did<00:00:57.890> have

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
at least with this course I did have

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.090 
at least with this course I did have
this<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.610> more<00:00:59.150> introspective<00:00:59.560> even<00:01:00.560> a<00:01:00.770> bit

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
this a more introspective even a bit

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.360 
this a more introspective even a bit
with<00:01:01.430> more<00:01:01.640> exposure<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:03.010> tend<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.160> have<00:01:04.339> a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
with more exposure you tend to have a

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.270 
with more exposure you tend to have a
more<00:01:04.610> practical<00:01:05.150> approach<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.590> shooting

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
more practical approach so shooting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.630 
more practical approach so shooting
gives<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> better<00:01:08.120> understanding

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
gives you a better understanding

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.540 
gives you a better understanding
shooting<00:01:10.640> scholars<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.990> think<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:13.370> a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
shooting scholars is I think it's a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.400 
shooting scholars is I think it's a
unleashing<00:01:14.180> potential<00:01:14.720> work<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:15.229> what<00:01:15.380> I

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
unleashing potential work that is what I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.719 
unleashing potential work that is what I
see<00:01:15.890> as<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.580> shearing<00:01:17.330> scholar<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:18.490> feel<00:01:19.490> that

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
see as a shearing scholar I feel that

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.940 
see as a shearing scholar I feel that
this<00:01:19.910> particular<00:01:20.119> program<00:01:20.660> really<00:01:21.259> calls<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
this particular program really calls you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.710 
this particular program really calls you
into<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:23.060> frame<00:01:23.660> which<00:01:24.340> basically<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:25.700> able<00:01:26.570> to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
into a frame which basically is able to

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.800 
into a frame which basically is able to
allow<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.940> refocus<00:01:28.940> your<00:01:29.330> your

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
allow you to refocus your your

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.520 
allow you to refocus your your
objectivity<00:01:30.380> focus<00:01:31.009> your<00:01:31.190> thoughts<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.530> over

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
objectivity focus your thoughts and over

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.260 
objectivity focus your thoughts and over
the<00:01:33.770> over<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.160> period<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.700> program<00:01:35.119> what

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the over the period of the program what

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.469 
the over the period of the program what
I<00:01:35.300> have<00:01:35.509> seen<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.910> human<00:01:37.910> in<00:01:38.030> Rolls<00:01:38.240> Royce

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
I have seen is the human in Rolls Royce

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.260 
I have seen is the human in Rolls Royce
program<00:01:39.340> makes<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.550> aware<00:01:40.910> of<00:01:40.940> your

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
potential and shows the opportunities

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.740 
potential and shows the opportunities
what<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.509> done<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:44.930> it

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750

may give me so much an idea about what

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.040 
may give me so much an idea about what
Oxford<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.250> all<00:02:07.430> about<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.060> Oxford<00:02:08.479> culture

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
Oxford is all about the Oxford culture

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.710 
Oxford is all about the Oxford culture
and<00:02:09.320> how<00:02:09.470> people<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.450> committed<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.660> so

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and how people are committed and so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.230 
and how people are committed and so
honest<00:02:12.200> about<00:02:12.320> their<00:02:12.740> work<00:02:12.980> actually<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
honest about their work actually it's a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540 
honest about their work actually it's a
very<00:02:14.690> wonderful<00:02:14.990> place<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.860> if<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.280> didn't

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
very wonderful place to be if I didn't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.100 
very wonderful place to be if I didn't
have<00:02:16.700> family<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.240> go<00:02:17.420> back<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.660> would<00:02:17.990> have

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
have family to go back I would have

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.710 
have family to go back I would have
rather<00:02:18.260> wanted<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.890> continue<00:02:19.640> being<00:02:20.180> here<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
rather wanted to continue being here and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.050 
rather wanted to continue being here and
I<00:02:21.470> think<00:02:21.500> there's<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.130> much<00:02:22.250> opportunities

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I think there's so much opportunities

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.180 
I think there's so much opportunities
here<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.630> know<00:02:23.780> because<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.530> come<00:02:24.920> from<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
here you know because I come from a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
here you know because I come from a
science<00:02:25.520> background<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.210> are<00:02:26.300> only<00:02:26.450> doing

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
science background and we are only doing

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.930 
science background and we are only doing
science<00:02:27.500> but<00:02:28.070> here<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.430> see<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
science but here you see the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.110 
science but here you see the
intermingling<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.870> science<00:02:30.380> with<00:02:30.560> industry<00:02:31.220> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
intermingling of science with industry I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.630 
intermingling of science with industry I
think<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.510> enjoy<00:02:32.780> Oxford<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.470> mean<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.460> would

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
think I enjoy Oxford I mean it would

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.850 
think I enjoy Oxford I mean it would
have<00:02:34.670> been<00:02:34.880> very<00:02:34.910> different<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.200> did<00:02:36.320> not<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.800> in

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
have been very different I did not be in

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.600 
have been very different I did not be in
a<00:02:37.190> setting<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.710> place<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:40.250> know<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.430> can

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
a setting for the place you know you can

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.760 
a setting for the place you know you can
have<00:02:40.790> courses<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.420> classrooms<00:02:41.900> but<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> most

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
have courses and classrooms but the most

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.460 
have courses and classrooms but the most
beautiful<00:02:43.250> thing<00:02:43.400> about<00:02:43.490> this<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
beautiful thing about this is the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.290 
beautiful thing about this is the
culture<00:02:45.890> that's<00:02:46.100> there<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.490> it's<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.030> mixture

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
culture that's there it's it's a mixture

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.640 
culture that's there it's it's a mixture
it's<00:02:47.540> not<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.080> splendor<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's not just the splendor of the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.740 
it's not just the splendor of the
buildings<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.490> tradition<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.540> place

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
buildings and the tradition of the place

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
buildings and the tradition of the place
and<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:52.040> everything<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
and it's everything it's it's the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.460 
and it's everything it's it's the
culture<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.970> university<00:02:56.630> which<00:02:56.840> encourages

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
culture of a university which encourages

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.949 
culture of a university which encourages
you<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.709> think<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.520> question<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.750> think

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
you to think and question and I think

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.690 
you to think and question and I think
that's<00:03:00.140> been<00:03:00.320> really<00:03:00.380> wonderful<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.489> an

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
that's been really wonderful to be in an

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.880 
that's been really wonderful to be in an
environment<00:03:02.300> where<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.540> had<00:03:02.720> just<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.709> much

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
environment where you had just so much

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.510 
environment where you had just so much
of<00:03:04.810> academic<00:03:06.310> freedom

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
of academic freedom

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.460 
of academic freedom
I<00:03:07.550> think<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.030> several<00:03:08.239> things<00:03:08.600> which<00:03:09.320> are

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
I think it's several things which are

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.830 
I think it's several things which are
mixed<00:03:09.680> together<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.250> if<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.730> were<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.970> say<00:03:11.150> is

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
mixed together so if I were to say is

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.350 
mixed together so if I were to say is
basically<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:13.310> knowledge<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.910> get<00:03:14.030> out

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
basically the knowledge that you get out

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.120 
basically the knowledge that you get out
of<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.660> program<00:03:14.810> with<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.709> currents<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
of the program with the currents that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.310 
of the program with the currents that
you<00:03:16.280> make<00:03:16.430> with<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.670> participants<00:03:17.320> you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
you make with the participants you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.140 
you make with the participants you
become<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.769> part<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.190> Oxford<00:03:19.400> glory<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.120> a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
become a part of the Oxford glory and a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.600 
become a part of the Oxford glory and a
lot<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.110> fun<00:03:21.380> in<00:03:21.590> English<00:03:21.860> summer<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.340> think

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
lot of fun in English summer I think

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.830 
lot of fun in English summer I think
that's<00:03:22.730> all<00:03:22.910> roll<00:03:23.090> together<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.600> this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
that's all roll together is this

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's all roll together is this
programme

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.069 

I<00:03:27.129> think<00:03:28.090> there<00:03:28.209> are<00:03:28.329> two<00:03:28.510> or<00:03:28.750> two<00:03:28.900> addresses

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
I think there are two or two addresses

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.149 
I think there are two or two addresses
one<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.189> the<00:03:30.340> individuals<00:03:31.239> be<00:03:32.230> open<00:03:32.650> be

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
one is for the individuals be open be

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.839 
one is for the individuals be open be
open<00:03:33.189> for<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.849> experiments<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:36.129> think

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
open for the experiments and I think

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.670 
open for the experiments and I think
British<00:03:37.269> weather<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.689> special<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.290> highly

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
British weather a special is highly

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.429 
British weather a special is highly
unpredictable<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.180> they<00:03:40.989> should<00:03:41.230> do

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
unpredictable so I think they should do

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.610 
unpredictable so I think they should do
a<00:03:41.680> lot<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.099> background<00:03:42.760> work<00:03:43.629> themselves<00:03:43.930> by

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
a lot of background work themselves by

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.729 
a lot of background work themselves by
preparing<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.670> study<00:03:45.970> science<00:03:46.840> innovation

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
preparing to study science innovation

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.710 
preparing to study science innovation
entrepreneurship<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.700> policy<00:03:49.090> before<00:03:49.629> they

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
entrepreneurship and policy before they

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.690 
entrepreneurship and policy before they
come<00:03:49.870> over<00:03:50.079> here<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.409> that<00:03:50.560> they<00:03:50.680> can<00:03:50.859> then

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
come over here so that they can then

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.759 
come over here so that they can then
leverage<00:03:51.879> that<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.450> make<00:03:52.659> better<00:03:52.930> use<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
leverage that and make better use of the

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.770 
leverage that and make better use of the
program<00:03:54.250> if<00:03:54.700> someone<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.120> coming<00:03:55.359> from<00:03:55.450> India

program if someone is coming from India

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.410 
program if someone is coming from India
for<00:03:56.409> the<00:03:56.469> first<00:03:56.590> time<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.980> UK<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.239> find
