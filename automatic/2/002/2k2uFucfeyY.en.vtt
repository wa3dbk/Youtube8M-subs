and I'm saying you can use a mirror but
you<00:01:42.360> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> apply<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.560> pressure<00:01:43.950> as

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you want to apply much as pressure as

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.160 
you want to apply much as pressure as
possible<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.329> understand<00:01:45.810> apply<00:01:46.380> pressure

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
possible and understand apply pressure

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.179 
possible and understand apply pressure
boom<00:01:49.200> tighten<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.740> when<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
boom tighten it up and when you do this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.030 
boom tighten it up and when you do this
every<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.500> perfect

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
every time it's not going to be perfect

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.950 
every time it's not going to be perfect
you<00:01:56.340> might<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> overlapping<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.750> right

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you might get it overlapping like right

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.929 
you might get it overlapping like right
now<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.350> overlapping<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
now it's overlapping you really this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.249 
now it's overlapping you really this
kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.240> might<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.540> hard<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.049> my

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
kind of might be hard to see on my

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
kind of might be hard to see on my
camera<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.710> over<00:02:02.040> laughing<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.820> already

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
camera is over laughing but I already

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.899 
camera is over laughing but I already
know<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.899> basically<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.340> side<00:02:05.640> it's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
know so basically but on one side it's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.819 
know so basically but on one side it's
going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.270> straight<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.469> side<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
going to be straight and on one side is

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.320

going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> overlapping<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.819> basically<00:02:09.179> all

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
going to be overlapping so basically all

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.750
