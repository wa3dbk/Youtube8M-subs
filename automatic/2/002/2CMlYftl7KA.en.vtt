five or six days and get out and relief
plenty<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.960> reproduce<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.650> we'll<00:01:02.740> have

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
plenty to reproduce and we'll have

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.530 
plenty to reproduce and we'll have
another<00:01:03.460> batch<00:01:03.670> probably<00:01:04.090> just<00:01:04.240> like<00:01:04.390> this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
another batch probably just like this
