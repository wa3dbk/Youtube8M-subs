00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.160
 Hello friends 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.860
 literally yesterday I climbed here in groups 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.900
 vkontakte in search of a film to 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 look well and subsequently 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.690
 tell you about it stumbled upon one 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.890
 the picture is very contradictory in many 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.739
 plans called on the chain in short you 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.280
 Now I â€™ll tell you something about what 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.550
 speech in it and so the film tells us 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.620
 about the guy who came to the maniac 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.690
 This psychopath kills his mother and 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.739
 keep the boy live with him 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.760
 almost as a dog 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.300
 why i called this movie 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 controversial yes he clearly falls short 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 to blockbuster or horror but it 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.060
 really a psychological drama from which 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.760
 you are unlikely to remain indifferent all 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.340
 the film is built on what we are shown 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.090
 this guy 's life and show life 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.100
 a maniac who begins with time 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.220
 worry about his fate 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.040
 on experiencing you stack not on 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.920
 thoughts about how the guy will live 10 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.500
 chained to the wall about years 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.210
 will he continue his case after 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.120
 him in the middle of the movie i'm tired of so 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.380
 called bytovuhi maniac and already 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.030
 grown up underdeveloped guy 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.820
 I didn't want to watch the movie 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.440
 because of how to know how it will end 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.740
 and ending 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.260
 of course not disappoint me in many ways 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.230
 it seems she was far-fetched to 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.679
 the rest of the movie but the turn was 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.930
 really unexpected my score to film 7 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.550
 out of 10 points 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.629
 the actors did quite well 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.019
 his game 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.690
 especially maniac I don't know why but 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.000
 director fini takes a few minutes 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.500
 to sympathize even with this 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.310
 crazy psychopath as a whole movie on 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.620
 once 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.430
 but this time I would advise to see 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 him into thinking in the whole situation and only 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.210
 inspect until the end to put your personal 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.360
 verdict 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.730
 the thought laid down in the film sneaks up 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800
 bones 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.980
 betrayal is worse than murder and 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.980
 violence
