 once we already have money try 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.859

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.400
 although at the end of the song someone 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.100
 He speaks like a little girl or something 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.930

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.030
 has completely intrigued what 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.500
 says but completely involved 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.570
 so if someone knew something, 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.250
 knew how to guide what you can 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.960
 mean and besides it would be very 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.870
