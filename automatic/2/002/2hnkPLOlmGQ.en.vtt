00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.470 
alright now we're going to look at this
family-owned<00:00:22.650> system<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> first<00:00:24.330> thing

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
family-owned system now the first thing

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
family-owned system now the first thing
you're<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> want<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.829> check<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.220> is

you're going to want to check out is

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.749 
you're going to want to check out is
inside<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> slot<00:00:27.800> okay<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:29.039> shoddily<00:00:29.640> it's

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
inside the slot okay how shoddily it's

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.370 
inside the slot okay how shoddily it's
put<00:00:29.939> together<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> bear<00:00:30.989> circuit

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
put together so there's the bear circuit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.720 
put together so there's the bear circuit
board<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.480> pen<00:00:33.809> holders<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.730> very

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
board and the the pen holders is very

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.960 
board and the the pen holders is very
very<00:00:36.360> loosely<00:00:37.460> attached<00:00:38.460> its<00:00:38.760> kind<00:00:38.909> of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
very loosely attached its kind of

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.630 
very loosely attached its kind of
hanging<00:00:39.150> on<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.480> dear<00:00:39.540> life<00:00:40.339> yeah<00:00:41.339> so<00:00:41.519> that

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
hanging on for dear life yeah so that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.189 
hanging on for dear life yeah so that
kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> sucks<00:00:42.089> another<00:00:42.870> thing<00:00:43.079> that's

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
kind of sucks another thing that's

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.270 
kind of sucks another thing that's
interesting<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.620> look<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> controller

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
interesting is look at the controller

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.869 
interesting is look at the controller
Borsos<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:45.059> classic<00:00:45.510> 9-pin<00:00:46.730> reports<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
Borsos the classic 9-pin reports that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130 
Borsos the classic 9-pin reports that
we're<00:00:48.000> using<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> Atari<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> Sega

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
we're using the Atari and the Sega

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
we're using the Atari and the Sega
Genesis<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> stuff<00:00:50.159> so<00:00:50.729> I<00:00:50.760> thought<00:00:50.970> it

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
Genesis and stuff so I thought it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
Genesis and stuff so I thought it
wouldn't<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.420> cool<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.839> a<00:00:52.140> Genesis

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
wouldn't really cool if a Genesis

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.259 
wouldn't really cool if a Genesis
controller<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> compatible<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
controller would be compatible with this

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.389 
controller would be compatible with this
controller<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> came<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.350> sucks<00:00:55.620> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
controller that came with it sucks but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
controller that came with it sucks but
unfortunately<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> compatible

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
unfortunately it is it is not compatible

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
unfortunately it is it is not compatible
and<00:00:59.699> while<00:00:59.879> we're<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.179> subject<00:01:00.320> let's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and while we're on the subject let's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
and while we're on the subject let's
take<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
take a look at that now this is the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.950 
take a look at that now this is the
controller<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.979> all<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.270> it's<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.660> kind

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
controller here all right it's it kind

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
controller here all right it's it kind
of<00:01:06.990> looks<00:01:07.050> like<00:01:07.289> a<00:01:07.410> run-of-the-mill<00:01:07.679> clone

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of looks like a run-of-the-mill clone

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.389 
of looks like a run-of-the-mill clone
controller<00:01:09.560> over<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.890> button<00:01:11.190> side

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
controller over here on the button side

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.590 
controller over here on the button side
it's<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.410> B<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.600> turbo

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it's a a and B and then the turbo

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.419 
it's a a and B and then the turbo
versions<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.170> each<00:01:16.320> button<00:01:16.679> but<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.280> they

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
versions of each button but what they

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.639 
versions of each button but what they
did<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.030> flipped<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.929> see<00:01:19.500> normally

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
did was they flipped them see normally

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.010 
did was they flipped them see normally
this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.789> B<00:01:20.940> but<00:01:21.479> its<00:01:21.600> flipped

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this is a and this is B but its flipped

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.520 
this is a and this is B but its flipped
for<00:01:22.710> some<00:01:22.950> reason<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:23.700> idea<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.530> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
for some reason I have no idea why so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.199 
for some reason I have no idea why so
that<00:01:25.649> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> sucks<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:26.459> certain<00:01:26.789> games<00:01:27.000> are

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
that kind of sucks so certain games are

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:29.059 
that kind of sucks so certain games are
really<00:01:27.360> difficult<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.929> play<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:28.950> have

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
really difficult to play because I have

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.160 
really difficult to play because I have
to<00:01:29.099> get<00:01:29.250> used<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.520> being<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.849> other<00:01:29.910> side

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
to get used to being on the other side

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.169 
to get used to being on the other side
this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:32.310> only<00:01:32.550> game<00:01:32.700> I've<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.090> been

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.990 
that's actually connected look at that
all<00:01:43.739> right<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> most<00:01:44.250> interesting<00:01:44.819> thing

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
all right now the most interesting thing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
all right now the most interesting thing
about<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.420> system<00:01:45.660> is<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.280> there's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
about this system is that there's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.080 
about this system is that there's
actually<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.420> rom<00:01:49.289> hacks<00:01:49.619> built<00:01:50.069> into<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.550> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
actually some rom hacks built into it if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.020 
actually some rom hacks built into it if
you<00:01:51.390> boot<00:01:51.629> it<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.810> without<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.110> game<00:01:52.349> in<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.030> then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you boot it up without a game in it then

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.320 
you boot it up without a game in it then
you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.300> play<00:01:54.890> some<00:01:55.890> totally<00:01:56.489> awesome<00:01:56.520> rom
