00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
not dumb I'm sure they're doing it -

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.570 
not dumb I'm sure they're doing it -
damage<00:03:15.480> control<00:03:15.510> -<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.260> they<00:03:16.800> didn't<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
damage control - but they didn't have to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.310 
damage control - but they didn't have to
do<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.910> they<00:03:18.450> could<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.900> kept<00:03:19.140> their
