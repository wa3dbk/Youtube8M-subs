have the speed setup we have little tiny
screws<00:02:20.060> right<00:02:20.239> here<00:02:20.269> which<00:02:20.540> actually<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
screws right here which actually go to

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.720 
screws right here which actually go to
this<00:02:21.590> which<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.830> pretty<00:02:22.040> interesting<00:02:22.519> thing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
now check this out right here this is

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.960 
now check this out right here this is
the<00:02:24.769> ln2<00:02:25.629> mosfet<00:02:26.629> cooler<00:02:27.190> now<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.250> 20<00:02:28.760> phase

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the ln2 mosfet cooler now the 20 phase

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.149 
the ln2 mosfet cooler now the 20 phase
VRMs<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.989> are<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.170> here<00:02:30.409> this<00:02:30.620> actually<00:02:31.040> is

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
VRMs that are on here this actually is

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.130 
VRMs that are on here this actually is
used<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.670> cool<00:02:31.849> those<00:02:32.090> off<00:02:32.329> when<00:02:32.749> you're<00:02:32.900> using

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
used to cool those off when you're using

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.420 
used to cool those off when you're using
ln2<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.069> it's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
ln2 so it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910 
ln2 so it's
really<00:02:34.819> really<00:02:35.239> cool<00:02:35.480> thing<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.680> said
