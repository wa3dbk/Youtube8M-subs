00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello youtuber friends or if dedicated to the 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.769
 playstation 3 community to what anime 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.040
 each bringing them back a boxing 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.080
 how long has it been but not 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.650
 here I bring you two other news that 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.220
 I have brought this collection to this script 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 almost complete 1 on 2 in revelations and 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 the brother web 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 It is worth mentioning that this is a package 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 pretty cheap I bought the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.119
 four games for just $ 100 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 Included shipping was delayed one month but it is 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 a good comparison in terms of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 example the latest news that you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 they are bringing in several 128 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.460
 it seems a little more convenient 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.350
 bring it from the USA it came out very cheap 100 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.170
 dollars I do not know how much will be in pesos 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.699
 Argentines 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.820
 for example a game were saying 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.579
 200 pesos 400 pesos I'm not sure no 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.280
 I have reason to compare dollars 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.550
 with the weights I do not know if it's more expensive 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.399
 these 100 dollars that I have invested in 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.850
 these four games I do not have any idea of 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.789
 how about how the relationship will be but 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.789
 I think maybe it's a little cheaper 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.500
 I bought it for amazon for a 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.450
 dealer that has brought me the games 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.730
 good but not to do them so much 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 I'm going to start the unboxing 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.390
 as many already know the boxes of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 the games 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.180
 the cover of the back cover is not the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.070
 game version of the year because I do not believe 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.830
 that comes gay will not take you these games 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.000
 the greatest hits' I do not know if it will come with 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.000
 contents of lcd 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.570
 I explain to myself that maybe if maybe not 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 content of the game 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 a little less the camera back 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.120
 comes your manual 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.720
 black and white almost all textual 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.650
 and in the same manual I guess not this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.360
 is in English and this one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.360
 is in French 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.590
 in French I do not see any code coming 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.780
 it does not seem like no code is coming 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.780
 very well do not pass to this project 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.250
 I've been a fan of this saga of 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.770
 assassin's creed but I have not really 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.960
 played 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.940
 the saga from the beginning that's why it's 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.520
 that I have decided to buy all the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.430
 sagas already from the beginning we continue with 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.010
 the second album as you see is the edition 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.490
 that's how I trilogy that the three 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.190
 games 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.370
 I do not know if there will be several albums 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.060
 disco let's discover the cover 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.280
 says it has a 3-d format 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.190
 as many know 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.870
 I have the television between elche and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.519
 cinema 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.069
 and the reason why I have not brought 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.790
 games recently is because of that 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.230
 I'm still paying for the TV 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.860
 I just paid for it and I do not have money in 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.860
 this moment 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.660
 Let's see 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.450
 activate your youtube pastport do not lose 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.879
 this letter this card good 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.000
 it does not look interesting and now I'm going to 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.230
 try out 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.230
 what we see here 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.970
 it's like a mini mini manual 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.360
 how to use you play or how to put the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.690
 disc in the play is ridiculous but there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.690
 is 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.220
 and apparently 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.620
 that's how trilogi is written I suppose that in 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.900
 this single disc come the three games 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.610
 I suppose 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.610
 there is not any part that says 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.180
 I suppose the three of you will have to 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.960
 try on the pdi 3 does not come any other 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.790
 disk 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.590
 I guess the games are not either 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.530
 heavy should start about how much 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.139
 12 gigas each one so that they reach a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.879
 double layer disc no 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.870
 good friends youtubers I hope you 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.849

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.740
 I have brought this time assassin's creed 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.149
 and I would like to play right away 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.149
 but I'm playing sky bein 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.080
