00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
them but I don't have the key in because

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.360 
them but I don't have the key in because
I<00:03:22.950> wired<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.610> whole<00:03:24.410> system<00:03:25.410> up<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:25.980> so

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
I wired this whole system up in here so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.270 
I wired this whole system up in here so
you<00:03:26.430> could<00:03:26.610> turn<00:03:26.790> both<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.270> CV<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.950> radio

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
arms have the key and the reason why did

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.050 
arms have the key and the reason why did
that<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:39.530> because<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.710> truck<00:03:40.980> has<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.550> an

electric fuel pump on it even though

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.640 
electric fuel pump on it even though
it's<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> carbureted<00:03:45.050> so<00:03:46.050> whatever<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> keys

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
it's a carbureted so whatever the keys

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.160 
it's a carbureted so whatever the keys
on<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:49.200> hear<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.880> popping<00:03:50.880> noise<00:03:51.210> back<00:03:51.930> in

was leaking real bad oil like just like
about<00:05:45.630> not<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> quart

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
about not a quart

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.120 
about not a quart
I<00:05:47.990> didn't<00:05:48.990> even<00:05:49.050> drive<00:05:49.350> it<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:49.650> much<00:05:49.860> they'd

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
I didn't even drive it that much they'd

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.690 
I didn't even drive it that much they'd
leak<00:05:50.370> about<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.640> quart<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.150> week<00:05:51.620> but<00:05:52.620> I<00:05:52.700> was

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
leak about a quart a week but I was

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.280 
leak about a quart a week but I was
dumping<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.120> cord<00:05:54.420> in<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.870> decided<00:05:55.170> I'd

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
dumping the cord in and I decided I'd

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.770 
dumping the cord in and I decided I'd
put<00:05:55.500> in<00:05:55.620> 20<00:05:56.040> W<00:05:56.340> 50<00:05:56.730> and<00:05:56.880> it<00:05:56.970> slowed<00:05:57.480> it<00:05:57.600> quite<00:05:57.750> a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
put in 20 W 50 and it slowed it quite a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.980 
put in 20 W 50 and it slowed it quite a
bit<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:58.880> believe<00:05:59.880> it's<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.330> little<00:06:00.720> pressure

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
bit I believe it's a little pressure

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.060 
bit I believe it's a little pressure
sending<00:06:01.470> unit<00:06:01.650> it's<00:06:02.550> leaking<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.830> drain

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070

plug<00:06:05.250> means<00:06:05.610> new<00:06:05.820> gap<00:06:06.060> gasket<00:06:06.780> on<00:06:06.900> it<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.260> when

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
plug means new gap gasket on it so when

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.630 
plug means new gap gasket on it so when
I<00:06:07.380> change<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.860> oil<00:06:07.890> on<00:06:08.100> this<00:06:08.220> I'm<00:06:08.550> probably

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
I change the oil on this I'm probably

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.440 
I change the oil on this I'm probably

of<00:06:18.060> jumbled<00:06:18.780> wires<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.550> got<00:06:20.550> this<00:06:20.700> wire<00:06:20.940> running

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
of jumbled wires I got this wire running

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.290

the<00:06:21.420> runs<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.840> radio<00:06:22.200> and<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:22.880> CB<00:06:23.880> because

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
the runs the radio and the CB because

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.320 
the runs the radio and the CB because
this<00:06:24.480> has<00:06:24.750> power<00:06:25.050> to<00:06:25.290> it<00:06:25.380> all<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.620> time<00:06:25.860> and

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
this has power to it all the time and

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.820 
this has power to it all the time and
then<00:06:27.330> I<00:06:27.450> had<00:06:27.630> to<00:06:27.750> run<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.900> separate<00:06:28.320> ground<00:06:28.530> wire

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
then I had to run a separate ground wire

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.460 
then I had to run a separate ground wire
because<00:06:29.370> I'm<00:06:30.330> not<00:06:30.480> getting<00:06:30.810> good<00:06:30.960> ground<00:06:31.260> up

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
because I'm not getting good ground up

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.190 
because I'm not getting good ground up
in<00:06:31.590> the<00:06:31.680> cab<00:06:31.890> whenever<00:06:32.370> he<00:06:32.790> had<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.210> CV<00:06:33.750> on<00:06:33.960> you

flipped the headlights on it would uh it

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.410 
flipped the headlights on it would uh it
like<00:06:38.760> take<00:06:39.680> I'm<00:06:40.680> not<00:06:40.890> quite<00:06:41.100> sure<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.670> exact

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
like take I'm not quite sure the exact

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.120 
like take I'm not quite sure the exact
readings<00:06:42.870> but<00:06:43.110> I'd<00:06:43.200> like<00:06:43.380> to<00:06:43.530> take<00:06:43.680> out<00:06:43.890> the

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
readings but I'd like to take out the

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.240 
readings but I'd like to take out the
the<00:06:44.850> CB<00:06:45.240> would<00:06:45.450> like<00:06:45.660> like<00:06:46.500> shut<00:06:46.830> down<00:06:47.040> because

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
the CB would like like shut down because

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.490 
the CB would like like shut down because
it<00:06:47.430> wasn't<00:06:47.670> getting<00:06:47.760> enough<00:06:48.030> ground<00:06:48.360> as<00:06:49.320> soon

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
it wasn't getting enough ground as soon

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.470 
it wasn't getting enough ground as soon
as<00:06:49.590> I<00:06:49.680> ran<00:06:49.890> a<00:06:49.920> ground<00:06:50.700> wire<00:06:50.910> all<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.180> way<00:06:51.300> up

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
as I ran a ground wire all the way up

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.070 
as I ran a ground wire all the way up
here<00:06:51.510> to<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:52.140> battery<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:52.950> works<00:06:53.160> fine<00:06:53.460> I

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
here to the battery it works fine I

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.210 
here to the battery it works fine I
think<00:06:55.080> I<00:06:55.170> need<00:06:55.320> to<00:06:55.350> do<00:06:55.500> is<00:06:55.650> run<00:06:55.800> a<00:06:55.830> big<00:06:56.040> old

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
think I need to do is run a big old

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.570 
think I need to do is run a big old
ground<00:06:57.060> cable<00:06:57.540> straight<00:06:57.900> to<00:06:58.020> the<00:06:58.110> cab<00:06:58.580> not

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
ground cable straight to the cab not

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.440 
ground cable straight to the cab not
getting<00:06:59.880> good<00:07:00.030> ground<00:07:00.300> up<00:07:00.480> in<00:07:00.600> there<00:07:02.300> but<00:07:03.300> the

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
getting good ground up in there but the

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.850 
getting good ground up in there but the
old<00:07:04.100> 82<00:07:05.100> is<00:07:05.750> running<00:07:06.750> strong<00:07:07.110> as<00:07:07.350> everyone<00:07:07.830> I

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
old 82 is running strong as everyone I

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.490 
old 82 is running strong as everyone I
love<00:07:08.040> this<00:07:08.070> old<00:07:08.400> truck<00:07:09.170> it's<00:07:10.170> a<00:07:10.260> classic<00:07:10.800> to<00:07:11.010> me

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
love this old truck it's a classic to me

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.540 
love this old truck it's a classic to me
had<00:07:13.500> a<00:07:13.530> pretty<00:07:13.860> bad<00:07:14.040> leak<00:07:14.430> on<00:07:14.730> the<00:07:16.550> rear

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
had a pretty bad leak on the rear

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.960 
had a pretty bad leak on the rear
differential<00:07:19.040> but<00:07:20.040> I<00:07:20.100> called<00:07:20.430> underneath<00:07:20.790> it

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
differential but I called underneath it

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.510 
differential but I called underneath it
today<00:07:21.240> and<00:07:21.450> the<00:07:21.990> damn<00:07:22.200> bolts<00:07:22.620> were<00:07:22.830> like<00:07:23.220> I

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
today and the damn bolts were like I

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.790 
today and the damn bolts were like I
could<00:07:23.910> unthread<00:07:24.780> them<00:07:24.900> with<00:07:25.020> just<00:07:25.260> my<00:07:25.380> fingers

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
could unthread them with just my fingers

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.430 
could unthread them with just my fingers
I<00:07:26.070> think<00:07:26.790> it<00:07:26.880> needs<00:07:27.030> to<00:07:27.150> Gascon<00:07:27.600> the<00:07:27.690> diff<00:07:28.020> but

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
I think it needs to Gascon the diff but

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.400 
I think it needs to Gascon the diff but
I<00:07:28.710> just<00:07:29.520> tore<00:07:29.700> it<00:07:29.790> all<00:07:29.970> down<00:07:30.000> and<00:07:30.210> added<00:07:30.660> some

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
I just tore it all down and added some

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.630 
I just tore it all down and added some
