China<00:01:01.210> will<00:01:01.420> understand<00:01:01.929> which<00:01:02.079> way<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.320> go

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
China will understand which way to go

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.719 
China will understand which way to go
and<00:01:02.710> think<00:01:02.859> it's<00:01:02.979> going<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.370> left<00:01:03.579> or

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
and think it's going to the left or

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.880 
and think it's going to the left or
right<00:01:03.760> hand<00:01:04.119> side<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.960> people<00:01:05.170> come<00:01:05.470> up<00:01:05.590> and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
right hand side and people come up and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.460 
right hand side and people come up and
just<00:01:06.100> drive<00:01:06.369> it<00:01:06.580> through<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.880> middle<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.470> think

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
just drive it through the middle I think

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200 
just drive it through the middle I think
the<00:01:08.710> important<00:01:09.130> thing<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.310> say<00:01:09.549> about<00:01:09.670> penalty

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
the important thing to say about penalty

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.760 
the important thing to say about penalty
says<00:01:10.390> there's<00:01:10.810> no<00:01:10.960> right<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.350> wrong<00:01:11.409> way<00:01:11.649> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
says there's no right and wrong way of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.490 
says there's no right and wrong way of
taking<00:01:11.950> one<00:01:12.280> just<00:01:12.759> scoring<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.330> enough<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
taking one just scoring is enough you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.370 
taking one just scoring is enough you
know<00:01:14.649> as<00:01:15.130> long<00:01:15.580> as<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.850> score<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:17.229> the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
know as long as you score that's the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.749 
know as long as you score that's the
right<00:01:17.560> way<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.740> do<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.159> that's<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.429> perfect

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
right way to do and that's a perfect

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.300 
right way to do and that's a perfect
example<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.360> one<00:01:19.810> driven<00:01:20.170> down<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> middle<00:01:20.649> so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
example of one driven down the middle so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.399 
example of one driven down the middle so
normally<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.850> goalkeepers<00:01:22.330> dive<00:01:22.539> left<00:01:23.229> or

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
normally the goalkeepers dive left or

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.809 
normally the goalkeepers dive left or
right<00:01:23.590> trying<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.979> guess<00:01:24.159> which<00:01:24.369> way<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> play

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
right trying to guess which way the play

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.580 
right trying to guess which way the play
is<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.210> take<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.569> and<00:01:25.690> you<00:01:26.170> can<00:01:26.289> drive<00:01:26.530> it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
is going to take it and you can drive it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.800 
is going to take it and you can drive it
down<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.009> middle<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.670> says<00:01:27.880> he<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.630> we've

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
down the middle it says he now we've

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.590 
down the middle it says he now we've
seen<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.170> one<00:01:29.319> that's<00:01:29.530> bent<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:30.490> there<00:01:30.789> in<00:01:31.420> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
top corner and now we'll go for one side

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.449 
top corner and now we'll go for one side
40<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.380> bottom<00:01:35.679> corners<00:01:36.039> with<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.220> lot<00:01:36.429> of
