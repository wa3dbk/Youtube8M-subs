 Cute to wear the watch I did not spend more

 because this type of handicraft no longer 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.380
 draws more attention because I've seen 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.720

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.080
 Little things because everyone wants to take 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.820
 home a memory and the loss of 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.780

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.650

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.830
