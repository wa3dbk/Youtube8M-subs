00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hey guys fourth cell here and this is

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey guys fourth cell here and this is
going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.560> more<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.400> update<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> video

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
going to be more of a update to a video

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.750 
going to be more of a update to a video
that<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.990> previously<00:00:07.350> did<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
that I previously did on the how to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.610 
that I previously did on the how to
create<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> force<00:00:09.330> field<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> be

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
create a force field this is going to be

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.350 
create a force field this is going to be
pretty<00:00:10.889> much<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> same<00:00:11.190> video<00:00:11.670> except

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
pretty much the same video except

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.230 
pretty much the same video except
there's<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.380> new<00:00:13.889> step<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> latest<00:00:14.880> update

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
there's a new step but the latest update

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.880 
there's a new step but the latest update
of<00:00:15.480> volts<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> changes<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> way<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.800> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
of volts that changes the way that you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.779 
of volts that changes the way that you
actually<00:00:17.070> need<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:18.800> get<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> start<00:00:20.310> maybe

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
actually need to get it to start maybe

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.000 
actually need to get it to start maybe
it's<00:00:21.060> kind<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.510> self-explanatory<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.710> kind

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it's kind of self-explanatory but I kind

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's kind of self-explanatory but I kind
of<00:00:23.070> wanted<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> video<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of wanted to just do a video on it so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.970 
of wanted to just do a video on it so
that<00:00:24.600> way<00:00:24.720> people<00:00:24.750> don't<00:00:25.170> keep<00:00:25.470> asking<00:00:25.859> me

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that way people don't keep asking me

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.880 
that way people don't keep asking me
even<00:00:26.519> if<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.699> left<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.900> detail<00:00:28.740> explanation

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
even if I left a like detail explanation

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.580 
even if I left a like detail explanation
how<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> they're<00:00:30.630> police<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.170> probably

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
how to do it they're police it probably

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
how to do it they're police it probably
better<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.009> video<00:00:32.279> form<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.120> for

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
better in video form because I can for

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.840 
better in video form because I can for
sure<00:00:33.600> say<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> video<00:00:34.230> form<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.520> works<00:00:35.700> are

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
sure say that video form just works are

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
sure say that video form just works are
easier<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.340> didn't<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
easier for me so if you didn't see the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.250 
easier for me so if you didn't see the
original<00:00:39.239> video<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.600> still<00:00:39.809> gonna<00:00:39.899> make<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
original video I'm still gonna make this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
original video I'm still gonna make this
just<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> normal<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.820> we'll<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.270> an

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
just the normal one so we'll have an

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.010 
just the normal one so we'll have an
extractor<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:44.219> need<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> capacitor<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
extractor you need a capacitor and you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.080 
extractor you need a capacitor and you
need<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> projector<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> basic

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
need a projector these are the basic

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.700 
need a projector these are the basic
three<00:00:48.210> blocks<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> learn<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
three blocks if you want to learn the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.799 
three blocks if you want to learn the
security<00:00:50.489> system<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.879> defense<00:00:51.180> system<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
security system and defense system and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
security system and defense system and
rotation<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> turn<00:00:53.160> those<00:00:53.309> off<00:00:53.489> turn<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
rotation if you turn those off turn it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.310 
rotation if you turn those off turn it
back<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> click<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> after<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> if

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
back on and click on that after this if

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
back on and click on that after this if
you<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.399> check<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.789> how<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> do

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you want to and go check out how to do

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.180 
you want to and go check out how to do
that<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:02.010> want

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
that so what you want to do is you want

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.469 
that so what you want to do is you want
to<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.949> before<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to have this this now as before it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
to have this this now as before it
didn't<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> mode<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:08.280> there

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
didn't actually have a mode like there

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210 
didn't actually have a mode like there
was<00:01:08.580> no<00:01:08.729> mode<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
was no mode to this so now you at now it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.469 
was no mode to this so now you at now it
actually<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> mode<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually has a mode so you need to have

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
actually has a mode so you need to have
it<00:01:12.630> either<00:01:12.930> redstone<00:01:13.470> powered<00:01:13.920> use<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it either redstone powered use the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730 
it either redstone powered use the
multi-tool<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> turn<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.229> believe

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
multi-tool to turn it on or I believe

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.320 
multi-tool to turn it on or I believe
I'm<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.189> sure<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I'm not sure what that is actually I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
I'm not sure what that is actually I
have<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.900> into<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.560> are

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
have to look into this because there are

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
have to look into this because there are
some<00:01:19.860> new<00:01:19.890> blocks<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.460> branded<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.150> might

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
some new blocks that branded that might

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.929 
some new blocks that branded that might
just<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> security<00:01:22.140> system<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
just be a security system but I don't

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
just be a security system but I don't
know<00:01:24.000> how<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.220> need<00:01:26.369> some

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
know how that would work so we need some

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
know how that would work so we need some
power<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.409> ultimate<00:01:28.740> energy<00:01:28.890> cube

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
power this is an ultimate energy cube

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.260 
power this is an ultimate energy cube
and<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.659> boom<00:01:31.470> power<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.430> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and we just kind of boom power it up so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.940 
and we just kind of boom power it up so
then<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.689> didn't<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.049> enough<00:01:34.290> inventory<00:01:34.530> room

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
then I didn't have enough inventory room

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.819 
then I didn't have enough inventory room
so<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> need<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:35.909> 4<00:01:36.090> cm<00:01:36.420> 4<00:01:37.140> cm<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
so I need to get some 4 cm 4 cm as you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.420 
so I need to get some 4 cm 4 cm as you
get<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:39.049> mining

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
get it from mining

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
get it from mining
why<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.670> shift-click<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.240> working<00:01:42.570> there

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
why is my shift-click not working there

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.280 
why is my shift-click not working there
we<00:01:42.990> go

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
we go

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
we go
you<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.009> mining<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you get it from mining so if we put this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.160 
you get it from mining so if we put this
in<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.880> how<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.450> usually<00:01:48.990> what

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in here see how it's not usually what

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
in here see how it's not usually what
would<00:01:49.290> happen<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> put<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> here

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
would happen is when you put it in here

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.149 
would happen is when you put it in here
it<00:01:50.939> would<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.149> straight<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.649> as

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it would just straight up go and now as

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
it would just straight up go and now as
you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.610> these<00:01:53.729> little<00:01:53.909> red<00:01:54.240> indicate

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you can see these little red indicate

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.209 
you can see these little red indicate
that<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.079> off<00:01:55.259> whereas<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.740> one's<00:01:55.979> on

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that it's off whereas this one's on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.270 
that it's off whereas this one's on
click<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> turn<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.799> illa<00:01:59.009> start

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
click it turn it on and then illa start

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.760 
click it turn it on and then illa start
extracting<00:01:59.960> there's<00:02:00.960> also<00:02:01.140> upgrades<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
extracting there's also upgrades that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.050 
extracting there's also upgrades that
you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.070> put<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.399> here<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> make<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> go

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you can put in here to make you go

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.209 
you can put in here to make you go
faster<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.320> type<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> stuff<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.100> then

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
faster and all type of stuff and then

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.670 
faster and all type of stuff and then
the<00:02:05.399> capacitor<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.469> not

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the capacitor as you see that it's not

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.309 
the capacitor as you see that it's not
like<00:02:08.039> linking<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.959> anywhere

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
like linking it's not going anywhere

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
like linking it's not going anywhere
so<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> need<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> need<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so what you need to do is you need to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.440 
so what you need to do is you need to
take<00:02:12.000> these

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
take these

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.589 
take these
cards<00:02:12.870> click<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> capacitor<00:02:14.510> click<00:02:15.510> on

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
cards click on the capacitor click on

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.589 
cards click on the capacitor click on
the<00:02:15.690> extractor<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.040> way<00:02:17.269> now<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.330> power

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
the extractor so that way now the power

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.930 
the extractor so that way now the power
that<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.019> out<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.890> into<00:02:20.099> here<00:02:20.340> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that is going out is going into here you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.040 
that is going out is going into here you
don't<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.269> mean<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.660> mess<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.930> this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
don't really mean to mess with this

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.479 
don't really mean to mess with this
because<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.379> dirty<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.739> if<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.099> wanted<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
because it's dirty on if you wanted to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.400 
because it's dirty on if you wanted to
turn<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.730> off<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:23.940> some<00:02:24.300> reason<00:02:24.410> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
turn it off for some reason you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710 
turn it off for some reason you
definitely<00:02:25.830> could<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.190> need<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.450> blank

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
definitely could I need one more blank

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.410 
definitely could I need one more blank
card<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.500> will<00:02:28.709> take<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.099> blank<00:02:29.459> card<00:02:29.670> put

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
card we will take this blank card put

this blank card capacitor projector now

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.759 
this blank card capacitor projector now
this<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.500> gonna<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.830> power<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:36.090> need<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.769> type

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
this is gonna get power you need a type

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.680 
this is gonna get power you need a type
here<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.010> there's<00:02:38.340> cubes<00:02:38.760> there's<00:02:39.209> fears

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
here and there's cubes there's fears

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.920 
here and there's cubes there's fears
there's<00:02:40.260> walls<00:02:40.730> all<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.940> times<00:02:42.150> stuff<00:02:42.420> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
there's walls all that times stuff you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
there's walls all that times stuff you
put<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> use<00:02:44.580> multi-tool

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
put it in here I like to use multi-tool

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.300 
put it in here I like to use multi-tool
you<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.780> sure<00:02:46.140> use<00:02:46.349> redstone<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.130> want

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you can sure use redstone if you want

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.990 
you can sure use redstone if you want
and<00:02:47.549> then<00:02:48.480> boom<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> very<00:02:49.950> tiny<00:02:50.519> force

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
and then boom we have a very tiny force

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750 
and then boom we have a very tiny force
field<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.709> are<00:02:52.890> spots<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.549> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
field and then there are spots here to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.600 
field and then there are spots here to
upgrade<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.420> we<00:02:54.599> can<00:02:54.750> upgrade<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.920> grab<00:02:56.579> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
upgrade so we can upgrade if we grab a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.420 
upgrade so we can upgrade if we grab a
projector<00:02:57.299> upgrade<00:02:57.810> I<00:03:00.440> don't<00:03:01.440> want<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:02.310> have

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
projector upgrade I don't want to have

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.059 
projector upgrade I don't want to have
that<00:03:02.610> many<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.060> use<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> 64<00:03:04.200> you're

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
that many if you use a 64 you're

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.979 
that many if you use a 64 you're
probably<00:03:05.250> gonna<00:03:05.459> crash<00:03:05.700> your<00:03:05.849> game<00:03:05.970> at<00:03:06.810> least

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
probably gonna crash your game at least

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.360 
probably gonna crash your game at least
you<00:03:07.110> used<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> haven't<00:03:07.860> tested<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.220> this

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you used to I haven't tested in this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.400 
you used to I haven't tested in this
current<00:03:08.940> update<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.329> then<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.079> see<00:03:10.290> it's

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
current update and then if you see it's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.110 
current update and then if you see it's
so<00:03:10.560> small<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.160> need<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.610> remove<00:03:11.940> this

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
so small you need to like remove this

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.770 
so small you need to like remove this
put<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.079> back<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.739> ah<00:03:17.389> not<00:03:18.389> enough<00:03:18.600> power

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
put it back in and ah not enough power

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.640 
put it back in and ah not enough power
well<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.310> had<00:03:20.400> enough<00:03:20.639> power<00:03:21.350> we<00:03:22.350> would<00:03:22.500> be

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
well if it had enough power we would be

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.240 
well if it had enough power we would be
able<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.889> generate<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.329> not

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
able to generate this but it's not

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.349 
able to generate this but it's not
garnishing<00:03:26.250> enough<00:03:26.489> power<00:03:26.819> because<00:03:27.239> I

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
garnishing enough power because I

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.890 
garnishing enough power because I
believe<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> energy<00:03:29.060> cube<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.389> doing

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
believe the energy cube is doing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.400 
believe the energy cube is doing
something<00:03:31.109> weird<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.170> way<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
something weird but that is the way that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.960 
something weird but that is the way that
you<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:34.650> set<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:34.920> up<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:35.549> see<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.819> was

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you do set it up as you can see it was

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.340 
you do set it up as you can see it was
working<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.660> want<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> take<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.079> out<00:03:37.319> and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
working I just want to take this out and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.099 
working I just want to take this out and
make<00:03:38.100> sure<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.549> does<00:03:38.700> indeed<00:03:38.970> work<00:03:39.180> yeah

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
make sure that it does indeed work yeah

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.590 
make sure that it does indeed work yeah
it's<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.010> not<00:03:41.190> receiving<00:03:41.549> enough<00:03:41.880> power<00:03:42.209> so

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it's just not receiving enough power so

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.240 
it's just not receiving enough power so
you're<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.870> need<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.350> come<00:03:43.950> up<00:03:44.069> with<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
you're gonna need to come up with a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.830 
you're gonna need to come up with a
really<00:03:44.430> good<00:03:44.519> power<00:03:44.790> source<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.269> very<00:03:45.450> easy

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
really good power source a very easy

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.710 
really good power source a very easy
efficient<00:03:46.410> power<00:03:46.620> source<00:03:47.269> another<00:03:48.269> link<00:03:48.569> will

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
efficient power source another link will

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.259 
efficient power source another link will
be<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.049> an<00:03:49.139> easy<00:03:49.350> efficient<00:03:50.040> power<00:03:50.280> source<00:03:50.579> up

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
be for an easy efficient power source up

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.699 
be for an easy efficient power source up
on<00:03:51.510> top<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:51.870> check<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.290> out<00:03:52.350> as<00:03:52.590> well

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
on top so you can check that out as well

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
on top so you can check that out as well
so<00:03:52.950> that's<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.310> only<00:03:53.549> thing<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.389> has

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
so that's the only thing that has

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.530 
so that's the only thing that has
changed<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.079> how<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.260> do<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
changed and how you do this is with the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.750 
changed and how you do this is with the
extract<00:03:58.019> or<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.380> now<00:03:58.620> need<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.040> have<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.459> power

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
extract or you now need to have it power

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.240 
extract or you now need to have it power
to<00:04:00.090> versus<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.900> putting<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.380> power<00:04:01.620> source<00:04:01.980> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
to versus just putting a power source to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.910 
to versus just putting a power source to
it<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:03.060> still<00:04:03.329> need<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.480> power<00:04:03.720> source<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.889> you

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
it you still need a power source but you

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.569 
it you still need a power source but you
can<00:04:05.130> turn<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.519> now<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.280> easy<00:04:08.370> as

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
can turn it on now so it's as easy as

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.240 
can turn it on now so it's as easy as
that<00:04:08.639> as<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.329> see<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:10.169> stops<00:04:10.440> you

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
that as you can see it stops you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.770 
that as you can see it stops you
definitely<00:04:11.669> do<00:04:11.849> need<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.060> power<00:04:12.269> source<00:04:12.540> still

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
definitely do need a power source still

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.170 
definitely do need a power source still
it's<00:04:13.739> just<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.370> now<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.760> power<00:04:15.030> it

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
it's just that you now have to power it

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.710 
it's just that you now have to power it
so<00:04:15.959> we'll<00:04:16.049> turn<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.229> off<00:04:16.669> that's<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.910> if<00:04:18.419> you

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
so we'll turn that off that's it if you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.659 
so we'll turn that off that's it if you
liked<00:04:18.959> please<00:04:19.049> leave<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.799> please<00:04:20.310> check
