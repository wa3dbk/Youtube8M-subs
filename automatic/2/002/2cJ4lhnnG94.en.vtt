00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.900
 with two parts always starting from the outside 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.080
 The inside, the finer the 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.479
 Here, you pick more beautiful 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.030
 braid will stay, so look, I'll get it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 A strip from outside and play here 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 inside the other side do the same thing 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.409
 take one there and play it here 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 inside 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.959
 so and so here we'll make up 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.299
 The end picks up a little outside and plays 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.579
 inside 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.890
 to approach you can see 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:23.439
 best 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.620
 O take a strip and throw it to the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.620
 inside 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.659
 I have one more out of always good of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:39.700
 behind is taken there from behind wear and play 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:42.430
 into more local plays inside 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.310
 the fine arrow because it stays 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.590
 more beautiful and does not give in 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.739
 it takes a little bit longer 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.209
 It's also more beautiful to play for 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:59.950
 inside betray space the little finger and already 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:03.189
 plays in here as it is practical're 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.310
 who does not have much skill with braid 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.790
 with the hairstyle have to practice try 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:16.510
 practice that you will get the hang of it 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:23.260
 do not play it, do not play it 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:27.459
 will come back and will do this until 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.250
 in the end I was very thick 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.209
 got too thick back and got more 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.989
 thin this transaction become 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:44.349
 beautiful and is a super easy and 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.900
 fast fast more or less, it depends 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:53.440
 of your skill but it is practical but if 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.859
 did not have time to schedule the salon you already 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.510
 know pretends that you 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:05.109
 hairdresser and make yourself is 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.590
 important not to let go is playing 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.590
 inside 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 wake up thick is getting thinner 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:27.180
 There will be a way to get up for you. 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:36.570
 Can you live better with my hair? 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:39.780
 still more very long delay time 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:44.970
 outside passes inside 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:49.940
 This is it, and you're going to go there. 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:56.220
 do here inside and separates out 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:00.479
 passes into separates out to 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:05.370
 inside you forever separates to power 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:10.110
 to be easier for you than I left 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.389
 I just have to settle here. 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.760
 little more practice with braid always 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.280
 I liked to make braid I do braid 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.080
 embedded and not even then I have a 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:27.030
 a little easier but you do not 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:34.919
 There you go, you throw it here and it separates old 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:39.300
 here plays out here separates catches you playing 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.770
 forever working with both sides 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:48.060
 they were a little bit more because here 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:50.340
 It's too thin, I'll leave it to 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:58.020
 his point is very big is that way 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.599
 just so you understand the word 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:05.490
 now this 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:07.830
 but what if the little boy pulls it started there 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.400
 Comes with the scissors line with enough 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.400
 there is hair care for out 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.590
 and your braid is not ready now 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.770
 so this is how you could see her 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.960
 It is very easy to do very fast and very 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.230
 chic if you do not have a bit of 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.230
 practice still goes slowly separates the 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.200
