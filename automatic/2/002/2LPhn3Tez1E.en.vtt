00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
module is also soldered onto the logic

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.650 
module is also soldered onto the logic
board

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.280

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
casing around the back that surrounds

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.010 
casing around the back that surrounds
the<00:05:54.710> click<00:05:54.920> wheel<00:05:58.480> while<00:05:59.480> prying<00:05:59.780> on<00:05:59.900> the
