00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
got this at tangerine one and i believe

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.300 
got this at tangerine one and i believe
it's<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.519> medicated<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.660> only<00:03:22.310> 329

it's it's medicated it was only 329

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.240 
it's it's medicated it was only 329
which<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.269> guess<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.480> pretty<00:03:25.019> fair<00:03:25.260> price<00:03:25.530> cuz
