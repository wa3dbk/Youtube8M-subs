00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello there is a psycho arthur and we look 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.330
 battle from player 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 takes a b cn from the clan red rush 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.240
 actually dude will be mouse and gets 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.060
 He is on the map Murovanka and lags me 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.439
 replay now replay doesn't lag and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.599
 actually getting on murovanka driving 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 Mouse more precisely for the levers 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.910
 it who knows what it manages but 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.149
 general is not the point 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 takes decides to instigate the forest and this is in fact 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.910
 really real thought I'm always on this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.649
 map when I still remember in those times when 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.489
 did not turn off these modes I got into 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 this line and I realized one thing that occupation 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.230
 here this position behind 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.120
 lads with normal guns and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.930
 normal light makes this fight easy 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 in 2 minutes 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.530
 the only question is how actually from 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.799
 your allies are shooting and can they 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990
 at a certain point when actually 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:11.100
 your light will end to take over 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.920
 actually this task and it is necessary to push 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.350
 I was pretty quick at my place 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.619
 cases when I still germinate all 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 it was clear but that's how the allies are n't 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.560
 time to seize the yarn fight them 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 material advantage here is mouse 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.200
 kill is very difficult and takes and makes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 true that does not go to the very edge of the forest 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.770
 because then the encounter battle 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.630
 a lot of kids are leaving for that one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 side and from there it can muster be able 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.480
 quickly figure out as part of the body 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.230
 this kid is covered 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:49.950
 they don't throw a piece at him and he just 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:51.870
 I enter the building, it just explodes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.570
 breaks into base 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.850
 cutting blends but heats up to hell in 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.720
 with the enemy only mouse cartoon 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:07.440
 allow such a khan and yes he like 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.650
 real hero just lay down with bones 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.160
 for the victory and in fact it's she 3 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.320
 clearly 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.710
 -7 just due to this tank he 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.110
 drove lit and broke 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.900
 inside well, well handsome, so 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 Respect and and mouse, they Respect this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.240
 lads who often serve nipples 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.150
 garbage where in general those who want to ride 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.750
 on baby those who think include lego or 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.720
 no necessarily pumping necessary 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.230
 to the suffering for such races 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.700
 for fun and soul rashit hardcore 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.230
 Murovanka and forsen battles for a couple of minutes on 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.920
 actually why will this 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.750
 delayed well because allies i 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.970
 already said earlier not for whether they are not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.070
 just grabbed the thread of the battle and did not 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.850
 here is selling sharply as well as mouse aim 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.760
 steel themselves chopping wood or maybe they are so 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.860
 so already like to savor the victory because 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.400
