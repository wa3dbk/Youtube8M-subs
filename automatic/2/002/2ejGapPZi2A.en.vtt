show you how easy it is the little slit
down<00:01:36.920> about<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.159> deep<00:01:38.460> sort<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.939> halfway

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
down about that deep sort of halfway

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
down about that deep sort of halfway
between<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.290> finger<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
between your finger and then your

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.630 
between your finger and then your
knuckle<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.340> cover<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.549> we

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
knuckle and then just cover them up we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.219 
knuckle and then just cover them up we
come<00:01:44.820> fast<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.329> need<00:01:45.540> fine<00:01:45.780> compost

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
come fast you don't need fine compost

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
come fast you don't need fine compost
whatsoever<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> big<00:01:47.220> seeds<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
whatsoever because the big seeds and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
whatsoever because the big seeds and
they<00:01:48.990> send<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> big<00:01:49.470> root<00:01:49.740> out<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> they'll<00:01:50.310> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
they send a big root out and they'll for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.539 
they send a big root out and they'll for
salt<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.210> there's<00:01:51.360> no<00:01:51.450> need<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.549> get

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
salt and so there's no need to get

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
salt and so there's no need to get
really<00:01:54.329> fine<00:01:54.540> compost<00:01:56.149> there<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
really fine compost there these are the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
really fine compost there these are the

but you get about six to eight to a
plant<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.720> learn<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.870> scramble<00:02:16.740> about

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
plant you just learn to scramble about

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
plant you just learn to scramble about
everywhere<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.960> they're<00:02:19.110> really<00:02:19.230> sweet<00:02:19.500> in

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800

this star fantastically well over winter
so<00:02:22.830> I'm<00:02:23.550> growing<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.030> more<00:02:24.210> allows<00:02:25.040> same<00:02:26.040> thing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so I'm growing to more allows same thing

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.760 
so I'm growing to more allows same thing
with<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.520> with<00:02:27.390> anything<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> cucumber<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
with it with anything like a cucumber a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.380 
with it with anything like a cucumber a
squash<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.340> saw<00:02:29.820> them<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.120> their<00:02:30.270> edge

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
squash see saw them on their edge

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
squash see saw them on their edge
because<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.170> root<00:02:31.380> will<00:02:31.590> come<00:02:31.800> out<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
because this the root will come out of

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.060 
because this the root will come out of
the<00:02:32.910> edge<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:34.050> saw<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> sides<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the edge you saw them on the sides and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.530 
the edge you saw them on the sides and
you<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> lot<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.550> compost<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.120> sometimes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you get a lot of compost on sometimes

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.290 
you get a lot of compost on sometimes
the<00:02:36.660> rib<00:02:36.870> cap<00:02:37.110> pushed<00:02:37.440> her<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.700> seat<00:02:38.970> shell

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
the rib cap pushed her the seat shell

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.860 
the rib cap pushed her the seat shell
through<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:39.870> get<00:02:40.020> stuck<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.720> I'll<00:02:42.720> do

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
through and they get stuck up so I'll do

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
through and they get stuck up so I'll do
it<00:02:42.930> left<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.320> right-handed<00:02:43.800> because<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
it left and right-handed because of the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
it left and right-handed because of the
way<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> camera<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.480> based<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.230> simply

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
way the camera is so based I just simply

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
way the camera is so based I just simply
push<00:02:47.520> them<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.880> maybe<00:02:48.180> twice<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> depth<00:02:48.930> of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
push them in maybe twice the depth of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.850 
push them in maybe twice the depth of
the<00:02:49.260> seed<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:51.630> their<00:02:52.080> edge<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.730> just

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
the seed on their edge like so and just

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.910 
the seed on their edge like so and just
cover<00:02:58.860> up<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> compost<00:02:59.550> again<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.830> they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
cover up the compost again so they

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.040 
cover up the compost again so they
couldn't<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.280> easier

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
couldn't be easier

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.220 
couldn't be easier
nothing<00:03:04.050> rocket<00:03:04.380> science<00:03:04.710> for<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:04.950> job<00:03:06.230> both

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
the main stem you just keep picking them

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.680 
the main stem you just keep picking them
and<00:05:30.639> they<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:30.969> keep<00:05:31.120> coming<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.569> coming

I'll<00:05:34.449> just<00:05:34.539> grow<00:05:34.719> one<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.169> that<00:05:35.259> does<00:05:35.440> does

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589 
I'll just grow one and that does does

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.869 
I'll just grow one and that does does
that<00:05:35.620> make<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.099> know<00:05:36.159> you<00:05:36.279> get<00:05:36.400> sick<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:36.759> death
