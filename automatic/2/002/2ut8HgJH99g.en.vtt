but all the characters have a voice I

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.570 
but all the characters have a voice I
guess<00:02:54.600> except<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:54.989> Winston<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.040> coach<00:02:56.069> they

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.640 
guess except for Winston and coach they
kind<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.819> like<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.720> sounds<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.319> racist

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650
