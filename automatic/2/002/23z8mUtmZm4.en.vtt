i'm talking about is right at the bottom

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
i'm talking about is right at the bottom
of<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:53.030> display<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.600> see<00:01:54.780> the

screen<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.720> hit<00:03:22.959> escape<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.530> i<00:03:24.370> can<00:03:24.609> adjust

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
screen a hit escape and i can adjust

screen a hit escape and i can adjust
some<00:03:25.060> things<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.720> where<00:03:25.840> i<00:03:25.870> wanted<00:03:26.290> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
some things so this is where i wanted to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.099 
some things so this is where i wanted to
start<00:03:26.470> before<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:28.090> full<00:03:28.450> screen<00:03:28.690> mode<00:03:28.930> is

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
start before the full screen mode is

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.599 
start before the full screen mode is
what<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.440> saw<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.310> instead<00:03:30.519> of

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
what we just saw that is that instead of

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.699 
what we just saw that is that instead of
having<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.940> nice<00:03:31.090> background<00:03:31.630> here<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.410> has

having a nice background here that has

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.039 
having a nice background here that has
my<00:03:32.859> desktop<00:03:33.310> i<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.700> have<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> distraction<00:03:34.810> free

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
my desktop i can have a distraction free

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.229 
my desktop i can have a distraction free
experience<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:36.310> any<00:03:36.459> color<00:03:36.730> background<00:03:37.180> i

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
hexadecimal i can also put in a chroma

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.460 
hexadecimal i can also put in a chroma
key<00:03:42.010> color<00:03:42.370> which<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.450> basically<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.930> green<00:03:44.320> or

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
key color which is basically a green or

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.890 
key color which is basically a green or
blue<00:03:44.769> that's<00:03:45.040> easily<00:03:45.370> removed<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.390> will

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
blue that's easily removed and that will

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.020 
blue that's easily removed and that will
allow<00:03:47.140> me<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> layer<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.280> video

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
allow me to have a layer of video

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.479 
allow me to have a layer of video
showing<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.840> ipad<00:03:50.320> demo<00:03:50.739> itself<00:03:51.160> but

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
showing just the ipad demo itself but

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.699 
showing just the ipad demo itself but
where<00:03:51.940> i<00:03:52.180> could<00:03:52.450> float<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.930> on<00:03:53.049> top<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.500> let's

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
where i could float it on top of let's

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.410 
where i could float it on top of let's
say<00:03:53.829> one<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.130> my<00:03:54.190> other<00:03:54.370> video<00:03:54.700> layers<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
say one of my other video layers and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.550 
say one of my other video layers and
i'll<00:03:55.569> show<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.049> some<00:03:56.200> upcoming

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
i'll show you that in some upcoming

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.309 
i'll show you that in some upcoming
tutorials<00:03:57.299> next<00:03:58.299> we've<00:03:58.420> got<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.810> ability<00:03:58.989> to

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
tutorials next we've got the ability to

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.660 
tutorials next we've got the ability to
have<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.560> always<00:03:59.769> on<00:03:59.950> top<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.519> is

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
have it always on top and this is

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.800 
have it always on top and this is
important<00:04:01.000> if<00:04:01.060> we're<00:04:01.150> going<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.299> manipulate<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
important if we're going to manipulate a

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.349 
important if we're going to manipulate a
number<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.260> Windows<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.769> can<00:04:03.370> scale<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.090> and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
number of Windows I can scale this and

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.050 
number of Windows I can scale this and
make<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.049> half<00:04:05.769> size<00:04:06.100> for<00:04:06.459> example<00:04:06.880> and

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
make it a half size for example and

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.479 
make it a half size for example and
maybe<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.930> want<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.260> put<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.500> up<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.920> corner

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
maybe I want to put it up in the corner

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.819 
maybe I want to put it up in the corner
while<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.120> work<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> screen<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:11.350> then<00:04:11.560> this

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
while I work on the screen and then this

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.349 
while I work on the screen and then this
will<00:04:11.980> always<00:04:12.340> be<00:04:12.549> here<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:12.940> even<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:13.269> I'm

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
will always be here so even if I'm

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.420 
will always be here so even if I'm
clicking<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.079> screen<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.889> won't<00:04:15.100> go

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
clicking on the screen this won't go

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.069 
clicking on the screen this won't go
away<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:16.180> could<00:04:16.329> be<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.570> important

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
away and that could be really important

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.900 
away and that could be really important
I'm<00:04:17.229> let<00:04:17.590> me<00:04:17.680> open<00:04:17.769> up<00:04:17.950> let's<00:04:18.400> say<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.579> Chrome

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
I'm let me open up let's say a Chrome

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.740 
I'm let me open up let's say a Chrome
browser<00:04:19.209> here<00:04:19.830> let's<00:04:20.830> give<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.099> an<00:04:21.190> example

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
browser here let's give you an example

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.120 
browser here let's give you an example
normally<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.960> let's<00:04:23.470> just<00:04:23.680> say<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.800> had<00:04:24.010> it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
normally and let's just say I had it

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.350 
normally and let's just say I had it
like<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.360> normally<00:04:25.360> if<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:25.990> working

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
like this normally if I was working

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.020 
like this normally if I was working
the<00:04:26.599> Chrome<00:04:26.840> browser<00:04:27.189> you<00:04:28.189> know<00:04:28.310> that's<00:04:28.909> not

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
the Chrome browser you know that's not

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.520 
the Chrome browser you know that's not
good<00:04:29.360> it's<00:04:29.659> going<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.900> make<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.199> thing<00:04:30.379> go

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
good it's going to make the thing go

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.050 
good it's going to make the thing go
away<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.310> if<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.550> activate<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.449> always<00:04:33.409> on<00:04:33.560> top

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
away so if I activate the always on top

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.480 
away so if I activate the always on top
now<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.479> can<00:04:35.810> click<00:04:36.020> away<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:36.620> don't<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:36.979> done

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
now I can click away and don't that done

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.040 
now I can click away and don't that done
do<00:04:37.789> my<00:04:37.909> thing<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.479> doesn't<00:04:38.780> have<00:04:38.900> any

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
do my thing and it doesn't have any

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.679 
do my thing and it doesn't have any
effect<00:04:39.349> at<00:04:39.439> all<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.189> pretty<00:04:40.669> cool<00:04:40.759> let's<00:04:41.509> see<00:04:41.659> a

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
effect at all so pretty cool let's see a

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.230 
effect at all so pretty cool let's see a
couple<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.139> other<00:04:42.169> options<00:04:42.889> here<00:04:43.120> scaling<00:04:44.120> is

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
couple the other options here scaling is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270 
couple the other options here scaling is
neat<00:04:44.419> because<00:04:44.569> I<00:04:44.990> can<00:04:45.500> have<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.740> stretch<00:04:46.069> to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
neat because I can have it stretch to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.589 
neat because I can have it stretch to
the<00:04:46.400> size<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.849> screen<00:04:46.939> or<00:04:47.270> show<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:47.509> an

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
the size of the screen or show it an

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.020 
the size of the screen or show it an
actual<00:04:47.840> size<00:04:48.349> I'm<00:04:48.650> on<00:04:48.889> a<00:04:48.919> pretty<00:04:49.280> big<00:04:49.550> monitor

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
actual size I'm on a pretty big monitor

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.700 
actual size I'm on a pretty big monitor
here<00:04:50.439> this<00:04:51.439> is<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> Mac<00:04:52.210> 27-inch<00:04:53.210> imac<00:04:53.719> so<00:04:54.110> it

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
here this is a Mac 27-inch imac so it

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.899 
here this is a Mac 27-inch imac so it
works<00:04:54.889> pretty<00:04:55.009> well<00:04:55.250> but<00:04:55.370> if<00:04:55.639> you're<00:04:55.759> on<00:04:55.879> a

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
works pretty well but if you're on a

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.490 
works pretty well but if you're on a
laptop<00:04:56.240> or<00:04:56.599> something<00:04:56.930> else<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.259> can<00:04:57.289> adjust

laptop or something else you can adjust

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.589 
laptop or something else you can adjust
the<00:04:57.860> size<00:04:58.069> a<00:04:58.099> little<00:04:58.340> easier<00:04:58.699> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.479> also

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
the size a little easier you can also

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.709 
the size a little easier you can also
force<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.139> into<00:05:00.289> landscape<00:05:00.860> mode<00:05:01.240> or<00:05:02.240> portrait

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
force it into landscape mode or portrait

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.029 
force it into landscape mode or portrait
mode<00:05:02.870> which<00:05:03.199> isn't<00:05:03.469> what<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:03.590> want<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.919> do

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
mode which isn't what I want to do

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.790 
mode which isn't what I want to do
because<00:05:04.550> I'm<00:05:04.759> having<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.270> orienting<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.650> way

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
because I'm having it orienting the way

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.920 
because I'm having it orienting the way
that<00:05:07.069> I'm<00:05:07.490> actually<00:05:07.789> holding<00:05:08.120> it<00:05:08.419> right<00:05:08.629> so

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that I'm actually holding it right so

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.480 
that I'm actually holding it right so
that's<00:05:09.199> kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.560> important<00:05:09.949> if<00:05:10.039> I<00:05:10.129> turn<00:05:10.340> it

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
that's kind of important if I turn it

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.140 
that's kind of important if I turn it
off<00:05:11.110> automatic<00:05:12.110> orientation<00:05:12.909> we<00:05:13.909> already

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
off automatic orientation we already

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.740 
off automatic orientation we already
kind<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.389> demonstrated<00:05:14.990> this<00:05:15.169> feature

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
kind of demonstrated this feature

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.879 
kind of demonstrated this feature
alright<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.960> then<00:05:18.110> next<00:05:18.319> you've<00:05:18.529> got<00:05:18.710> the

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
alright and then next you've got the

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.439 
alright and then next you've got the
skin<00:05:19.250> now<00:05:19.460> that's<00:05:19.639> kind<00:05:19.849> of<00:05:19.909> cool<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.120> can

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
skin now that's kind of cool you can

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.929 
skin now that's kind of cool you can
have<00:05:20.629> either<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.500> black<00:05:21.680> or<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.430> black<00:05:22.610> mini

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
have either the black or the black mini

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.760 
have either the black or the black mini
the<00:05:23.180> why<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.389> to<00:05:23.539> the<00:05:23.629> white<00:05:23.779> mini<00:05:24.020> I'm<00:05:24.500> on<00:05:24.740> a

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
the why you to the white mini I'm on a

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.260 
the why you to the white mini I'm on a
white<00:05:25.039> mini<00:05:25.310> so<00:05:25.759> that's<00:05:25.909> what<00:05:26.029> i'm<00:05:26.120> showing

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
white mini so that's what i'm showing

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.600 
white mini so that's what i'm showing
but<00:05:26.629> i<00:05:26.779> could<00:05:27.080> let's<00:05:27.710> say<00:05:27.770> demonstrate<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.460> as

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
but i could let's say demonstrate it as

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.519 
but i could let's say demonstrate it as
a<00:05:28.639> black<00:05:29.090> mini<00:05:29.360> i<00:05:29.569> can<00:05:29.810> even<00:05:29.930> use<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:30.409> other

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
a black mini i can even use the other

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.769 
a black mini i can even use the other
one<00:05:30.740> not<00:05:31.610> quite<00:05:31.879> frankly<00:05:32.240> sure<00:05:32.509> what<00:05:32.690> the

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
one not quite frankly sure what the

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.529 
one not quite frankly sure what the
difference<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:33.139> let's<00:05:33.349> go<00:05:33.500> take<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.770> look<00:05:33.800> oh<00:05:34.539> i

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
difference is let's go take a look oh i

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.180 
difference is let's go take a look oh i
see<00:05:35.870> what<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.050> is<00:05:36.110> it's<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.650> difference<00:05:36.979> of<00:05:37.069> the

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
see what it is it's a difference of the

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.800 
see what it is it's a difference of the
frame<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.789> for<00:05:38.120> example<00:05:38.180> if<00:05:38.509> you<00:05:38.599> want<00:05:38.750> to

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
frame so for example if you want to

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.390 
frame so for example if you want to
really<00:05:38.990> truly<00:05:39.229> represent<00:05:39.770> your<00:05:39.860> frame<00:05:40.129> and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
really truly represent your frame and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.909 
really truly represent your frame and
the<00:05:40.969> orientation<00:05:41.960> go<00:05:42.349> with<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.620> actual

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
the orientation go with the actual

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.019 
the orientation go with the actual
device<00:05:43.870> because<00:05:44.870> in<00:05:44.990> this<00:05:45.080> case<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:46.610> white

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
device because in this case the white

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.050 
device because in this case the white
mini<00:05:47.330> is<00:05:47.479> an<00:05:47.839> exact<00:05:48.500> replica<00:05:48.770> seezle<00:05:49.520> thinner

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
mini is an exact replica seezle thinner

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.600 
mini is an exact replica seezle thinner
here<00:05:50.389> on<00:05:50.569> the<00:05:50.810> frame<00:05:51.099> alright<00:05:52.099> a<00:05:52.219> couple<00:05:52.279> other

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
here on the frame alright a couple other

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.649 
here on the frame alright a couple other
tricks<00:05:53.000> if<00:05:53.659> i<00:05:53.750> go<00:05:53.900> into<00:05:54.139> preferences<00:05:55.539> this<00:05:56.539> is

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
tricks if i go into preferences this is

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.179 
tricks if i go into preferences this is
where<00:05:56.810> you<00:05:56.870> can<00:05:56.990> optimize<00:05:57.229> it<00:05:57.560> now<00:05:57.680> i've<00:05:57.919> set

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
where you can optimize it now i've set

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.600 
where you can optimize it now i've set
it<00:05:58.219> up<00:05:58.539> for<00:05:59.539> the<00:06:00.169> ipad<00:06:00.589> but<00:06:01.189> if<00:06:01.339> I<00:06:01.430> was

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
it up for the ipad but if I was

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.360 
it up for the ipad but if I was
demonstrating<00:06:01.789> let's<00:06:02.569> say<00:06:03.069> some<00:06:04.069> other<00:06:04.099> high

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
demonstrating let's say some other high

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.760 
demonstrating let's say some other high
res<00:06:04.580> device<00:06:04.939> or<00:06:05.240> if<00:06:05.360> I<00:06:05.449> had<00:06:05.629> the<00:06:05.810> iphone<00:06:06.050> or

res device or if I had the iphone or
iPhone<00:06:07.219> 5<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.729> would<00:06:08.210> switch<00:06:08.419> it<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:08.779> that<00:06:08.930> it

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
iPhone 5 I would switch it so that it

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.899 
iPhone 5 I would switch it so that it
more<00:06:09.110> fairly<00:06:09.439> represents<00:06:10.099> well<00:06:10.490> more

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
more fairly represents well more

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.149 
more fairly represents well more
accurately<00:06:11.110> represents<00:06:12.110> what<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.919> actual

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
accurately represents what the actual

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:14.839 
screen dimensions are and that will

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.290 
screen dimensions are and that will
allow<00:06:15.080> it<00:06:15.110> also<00:06:15.469> to<00:06:15.560> stretch<00:06:15.830> exactly<00:06:16.759> those

for<00:06:19.430> my<00:06:19.699> local<00:06:20.000> imac<00:06:20.509> that<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.839> can<00:06:21.020> set<00:06:21.229> it<00:06:21.259> up

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
for my local imac that you can set it up

for a variety of machines and you can

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.209 
for a variety of machines and you can

have it launched full screen by default

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.950 
have it launched full screen by default
here's<00:06:26.060> where<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.300> can<00:06:26.389> set<00:06:26.629> the<00:06:26.779> background

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
here's where you can set the background

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.050 
here's where you can set the background
color<00:06:27.229> and<00:06:27.740> if<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:27.919> use<00:06:28.099> the<00:06:28.250> color<00:06:28.430> picker<00:06:28.699> I

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
color and if I use the color picker I

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.179 
color and if I use the color picker I
could<00:06:29.779> for<00:06:29.960> example<00:06:29.990> go<00:06:30.439> into<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.770> wheel<00:06:30.949> and

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
could for example go into the wheel and

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.519 
could for example go into the wheel and
pick<00:06:31.400> out<00:06:31.580> a<00:06:31.610> nice<00:06:31.789> chroma<00:06:32.539> key<00:06:32.900> color<00:06:33.229> now

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
pick out a nice chroma key color now

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.529 
pick out a nice chroma key color now
again<00:06:34.310> if<00:06:34.430> you're<00:06:34.580> not<00:06:34.849> a<00:06:34.909> technical<00:06:35.330> person

don't worry about it chroma key is going
to<00:06:37.639> be<00:06:37.729> something<00:06:38.180> in<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.479> green<00:06:38.870> or<00:06:39.110> blue<00:06:39.319> fan

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
to be something in the green or blue fan

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.740 
to be something in the green or blue fan
why<00:06:39.860> you've<00:06:40.610> seen<00:06:40.879> the<00:06:41.000> thing<00:06:41.240> that's<00:06:41.509> called

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
why you've seen the thing that's called

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.650 
why you've seen the thing that's called
green<00:06:42.229> screen<00:06:42.800> before<00:06:43.099> I'm<00:06:43.520> sure<00:06:43.789> and<00:06:44.509> it's

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660 
green screen before I'm sure and it's

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.119 
green screen before I'm sure and it's
just<00:06:44.720> something<00:06:45.199> that<00:06:45.229> because<00:06:45.680> this<00:06:45.919> doesn't

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
just something that because this doesn't

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.760 
just something that because this doesn't
happen<00:06:46.460> in<00:06:46.759> nature<00:06:46.940> it's<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.960> very<00:06:48.169> easy<00:06:48.259> color

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
happen in nature it's a very easy color

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.409 
happen in nature it's a very easy color
to<00:06:49.039> differentiate<00:06:49.669> from<00:06:49.699> any<00:06:50.000> of<00:06:50.090> the<00:06:50.180> things

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
to differentiate from any of the things

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.089 
to differentiate from any of the things
that<00:06:50.659> you<00:06:50.750> might<00:06:50.900> be<00:06:50.960> wearing<00:06:51.409> or<00:06:51.770> the<00:06:51.800> things

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
that you might be wearing or the things

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.980 
that you might be wearing or the things
that<00:06:52.280> might<00:06:52.400> show<00:06:52.639> up<00:06:52.669> as<00:06:52.970> normal<00:06:53.330> objects<00:06:53.810> and

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
that might show up as normal objects and

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.540 
that might show up as normal objects and
therefore<00:06:54.800> the<00:06:54.889> computer<00:06:55.220> doesn't<00:06:55.370> get

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
therefore the computer doesn't get

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.159 
therefore the computer doesn't get
confused<00:06:56.030> and<00:06:56.120> remove<00:06:56.419> things<00:06:56.720> it<00:06:56.900> shouldn't

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
confused and remove things it shouldn't

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.619 
confused and remove things it shouldn't
you<00:06:57.440> can<00:06:58.129> also<00:06:58.250> have<00:06:58.580> it<00:06:58.729> set<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.120> full<00:06:59.300> screen
