 long overdue their preparation for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 subsides 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.539
 I'm not called Oksana video almost 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.449
 filmed 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.510
 so I do not know the first time but decided 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.490
 so you have to take part 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:36.710
 I will chew on this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:39.510
 designer's design we have michelle board 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.559
 it's called world history on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.789
 bookshelves 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 and I saw there already in the project it is already 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 will take off the embroidery here it is just 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.510
 Tich Well, here I have created the same 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 because I was going to embroider 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.059
 this great job but only well 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.860
 ordering all tags has become well here somehow 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.860
 lessons gathered falls sorry 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.180
 gathered don't know yet becomes honest 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 saying girls undecided here have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 me aida 18 began to mark her all not 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.479
 I just got a piece here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 how many 300 crosses are there on 230 but 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.710
 when I realized that if you mark it and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.710
 completely on this whole size 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.560
 750 on five hundred forty two crosses then she 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 it turns out that I have a big one 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.930
 spread out the dining table and here it is 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.049
 it turns out almost like this 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 the whole table is just pitch size i 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.149
 I do not know where then I will take this 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.159
 the frame and the sequel or rather, I know they will take it out 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.950
 just it will cost and I do not know 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.129
 mad money thread I have what I 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 she has already rewound some reels 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.040
 I have not yet rewound 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.260
 lie because I tried a lot 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.230
 another honda that's when she ordered 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.560
 once this is a little piece here I 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.670
 I ordered it for my son's portrait 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.390
 Linda 22 account try to get her 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.970
 the pieces are personally small but she is so 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.569
 so small I think so embroider 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.650
 worked out 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.930
 apologize pasush little if 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.180
 embroider like a grand project on 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.980
 such a canvas 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.299
 somewhere here now yesterday tried on 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.060
 shell help little corners on some 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:57.090
 corners I tried to mark it even 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.970
 TASS will not find shells and the Well 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.859
 here it turns out there is a dice 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.670
 cells in one centimeter literally 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.829
 it is very small this piece is not enough 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.650
 because i'm basically you are no longer 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:15.989
 I ordered here wanted to darker Khan 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.209
 second count but nowhere in any 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.459
 online store can not find ox 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.169
 the presence of 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.459
 so I do not even know probably all the same 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:30.379
 will this channel have such a cream color 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.099
 vanilla and probably this is the name 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:38.489
 further that before the mark I 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:45.680
 no embroidery at all 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:48.060
 mark up with this marker she looked 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.510
 never noticed anyone always somehow 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:58.519
 I embroider so it says that the marking 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.519
 can be removed 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.370
 etc. whether it is necessary to wash laundries 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.739
 using detergents 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.419
 Well, in general, I was afraid only 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.590
 marked out no more about 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:16.769
 Churchill yet nothing feared that process 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.370
 long and then it can be difficult to remove 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.359
 this label and bought this one too 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.359
 hemline ovsky 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.150
 cut in a box did not enter him a 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.940
 linear 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.560
 fairy tales other universal extra 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.590
 thin marker here it is quite thin but 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.850
 here at least it does not want to be written 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.700
 to focus that he disappear over 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.990
 48 hours well, if desired, it can be 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.260
 rinse with cold water here so can 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.140
 be try draws small 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:05:03.850
 pieces of the piece to embroider and then he 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:06.790
 I hope it will fade sopelki 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.550
 side stretch canvas 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:14.930
 I cooked buns size 28 because 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.680
 that I still thought that they would be on Windows 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.750
 embroider wax here I have this 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.060
 box I bought the river or in the store 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.890
 I have all my threads stored in boxes 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.410
 17 at the commemoration 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.150
 but she bought for the current process what 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.500
 were separately well here did she seem 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.010
 little toli one more will 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.050
 buy a waist as I do not know and reel 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.810
 I will be on an ordinary day all 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.160
 papas cardboard organizers will not 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.669
 take from there and embroider i'm going to 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.270
 his machine 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:54.850
 here he stands while on the current process lion 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:58.040
 going a little bit missing because 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:02.240
 to survive will have to cross that is going 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:08.240
 put it out of width and length sew up 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.220
 so here is the side is not enough because 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.990
 what turns seventy seven 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.000
 centimeters if on the eighteenth county 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:19.400
 Embroider and I have a machine width here 65 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.040
 Well, I'll see if, in principle, I 'm still 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.340
 I find the fabric of the twenty-second account is 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:31.350
 then she she 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:34.139
 she will enter me here in the yard with 16 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:38.270
 in March we still full of snow coming down every 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.919
 day therefore we live siberia in novosibirsk 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.680
 Well, in principle, such preparation 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:49.190
 process I don't know take off the first time for 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.000
 youtube so somehow everything is messy 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:57.870
 still hands tremble voice trembles 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.240
 the child is there and something two years old has become silent 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:07.260
 not sabretache there probably that's why a lot 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.540

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.930
 my country for my first so muddled 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:18.169
 video I hope that we are still with you 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:21.389
 meet and be together 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.100
 for a long time because it's so much better 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.889
 think our religious projects 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.750
 it could be for a long time even for someone 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:32.030
 someone big like mine not for one year 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.030
