00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.580
 Let's start to analize 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.250
 an ammonium pattern from a well water matrix 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 it is a pattern analyzed by 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
 that comes with your fairy certificate 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.870
 1 27 an uncertainty of zero comma 0 3 milligrams per liter 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.660
 the employer looked so 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.680
 without all stabilized 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.200
 posters 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.070
 select the method 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.060
 in this case 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 let's make ammonium in low range 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 we have the yanquis method of CÃ¡ceres 0 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 10 thousand liters of sample 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 5 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.139
 the bucket well race 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.870
 but if it is to be arranged that it is automatic glass factory always 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.459
 the measure will be much more 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.599
 effective 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.529
 we put him 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.529
 the lid 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.789
 and always very important when working with that picasso clean with the valeta 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.269
 there employment 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.349
 we introduce on the slope 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.349
 always in the same position 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.929
 we close we push to 0 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.929
 collect as initial 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.029
 is already doing works quito is now we take 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.379
 We return attached ian snell plug and the reagents 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.689
 We are going to ask you for four drops of this attractiveness 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.299
 in the first as distinct 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.029
 fast 3 and 4 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.369
 we close 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.699
 we invest one 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.079
 twice 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.079
 I am 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.199
 and we add 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.120
 recent reactive 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 four other drops 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.029
 of euros 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:37.029
 lewis 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.689
 we close 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.159
 we invest another couple of times 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.210
 we go back to india 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 we put the put in the position of acs 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
 if we press the countdown 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.110
 after these three and a half minutes 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 the team will tell me it improves the concentration of 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.629
 you are already having the countdown 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.629
 and when finished the equipment will measure automatically 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.180
 it works 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.930
 in the three forms of 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.930
 of love and in it on the ground and in the water 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.710
 happy but monastic like ammonia 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.089
 they are laughing 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.519
 as we see the result we steal ammonia nitrogen but coma noemi 

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.999
 grams per liter 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.839
 like the pattern 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.389
 we do not have as ammonium journalism we can change the result 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.259
 then I tried courses here 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.069
 and we change in chemical form 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.020
 others with ammonia 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.589
 these communicated 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.439
 and this would be ammonium 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:29.930
 and as we see match perfectly with the pattern the pattern has one like 27 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.619
 an uncertainty 0 4 3 

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.669
 and the team has given us a comma 2 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.969
 the team does not get us institution gopar adn second scheme 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.080
 but it is a very accurate measure
