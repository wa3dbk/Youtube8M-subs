00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.320 
once you've curled both sides take a
section<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.980> hair<00:02:12.130> from<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.400> top<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.850> one<00:02:12.880> side

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
section of hair from the top of one side

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.080 
section of hair from the top of one side
and<00:02:13.360> separated<00:02:14.320> into<00:02:14.470> two<00:02:14.860> strands<00:02:15.250> if<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and separated into two strands if you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.670 
and separated into two strands if you
are<00:02:16.209> working<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.600> hair<00:02:16.870> extensions<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.500> I

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
are working with hair extensions like I

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.130 
are working with hair extensions like I
am<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:18.430> sure<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.970> incorporate<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.480> strand<00:02:19.900> from

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
am be sure to incorporate a strand from

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.990 
am be sure to incorporate a strand from
your<00:02:20.290> hair<00:02:20.410> extensions<00:02:20.950> into<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> section<00:02:21.850> so

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
your hair extensions into the section so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.940 
your hair extensions into the section so
that<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.480> achieve<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.959> long<00:02:23.320> rope<00:02:23.680> braid

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that you can achieve a long rope braid

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.310 
that you can achieve a long rope braid
for<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.730> row<00:02:24.970> braid<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.720> be<00:02:25.840> creating<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
for this row braid we will be creating a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.600 
for this row braid we will be creating a
rope<00:02:26.530> braid<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> thinner<00:02:27.490> side

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
rope braid that is on the thinner side

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.760 
rope braid that is on the thinner side
so<00:02:28.180> don't<00:02:28.209> work<00:02:28.660> with<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> section<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.470> too

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
so don't work with a section that is too

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.340 
so don't work with a section that is too
big<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.489> create<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.880> rope<00:02:31.239> braid<00:02:31.450> separate<00:02:32.140> your

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
big to create a rope braid separate your

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.260 
big to create a rope braid separate your
section<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.770> hair<00:02:32.830> into<00:02:33.310> two<00:02:33.489> equal<00:02:33.520> strands

section of hair into two equal strands

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.390 
section of hair into two equal strands
and<00:02:34.450> begin<00:02:34.750> twisting<00:02:35.290> each<00:02:35.470> strand<00:02:35.860> towards

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
and begin twisting each strand towards

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
and begin twisting each strand towards
your<00:02:36.550> face<00:02:36.760> while<00:02:37.120> wrapping<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.660> strands

this<00:03:07.220> rope<00:03:07.490> braid<00:03:07.670> will<00:03:07.850> be<00:03:07.970> slightly<00:03:08.270> thicker

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
this rope braid will be slightly thicker

exactly<00:03:10.670> what<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.060> want<00:03:11.300> use<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.320> same

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
exactly what we want use the same

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.290 
exactly what we want use the same
technique<00:03:12.950> as<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.340> did<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.700> create<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.090> first

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
technique as you did to create the first

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.270 
technique as you did to create the first
rope<00:03:14.600> braid<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.050> braid<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:15.620> far<00:03:15.860> down<00:03:16.100> as<00:03:16.250> you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
rope braid and braid as far down as you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.750 
rope braid and braid as far down as you
can

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
can

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.490 
can

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.550 

at<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:25.060> point<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.660> should<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.290> rope

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
at this point you should have to rope

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.920 
at this point you should have to rope
braids<00:03:26.800> on<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:27.280> side<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.880> thinner<00:03:28.450> one<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:28.840> the

braids on one side a thinner one at the

top of your head and a thicker one right
beneath<00:03:31.060> it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
beneath it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.090 
beneath it
now<00:03:31.930> you're<00:03:32.140> going<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.350> create<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.710> exact

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
now you're going to create the exact

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:41.050 
now you're going to create the exact
same<00:03:33.340> two<00:03:33.610> rope<00:03:33.880> braids<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.570> other<00:03:34.750> side

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.390

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
once you finish row operating you should

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.790 
once you finish row operating you should
have<00:03:43.580> four<00:03:43.940> row<00:03:44.150> braids<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.600> total<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.500> first

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
have four row braids in total the first

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.500 
have four row braids in total the first
thing<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.130> want<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.520> is<00:03:46.790> combine<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.300> two

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
thing you want to do is combine the two

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.300 
thing you want to do is combine the two
thinner<00:03:47.810> rope<00:03:48.080> braids<00:03:48.380> at<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.740> top<00:03:48.980> at<00:03:49.220> the
