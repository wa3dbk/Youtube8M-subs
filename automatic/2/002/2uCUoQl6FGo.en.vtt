00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
whole distance between here and there so

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.500 
whole distance between here and there so
we're<00:05:32.340> gonna<00:05:32.460> go<00:05:32.640> there<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:32.940> talk<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.390> then

we're gonna go there and talk and then
maybe<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.900> think<00:05:34.260> actually<00:05:34.440> i<00:05:34.650> think<00:05:34.710> when<00:05:34.950> we

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
maybe I think actually i think when we

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.860 
maybe I think actually i think when we
go<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.160> hillis<00:05:35.490> one<00:05:35.670> they<00:05:35.820> say<00:05:35.970> oh<00:05:36.150> yeah<00:05:36.630> they

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
go to hillis one they say oh yeah they

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.090 
go to hillis one they say oh yeah they
came<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.260> then<00:05:37.350> we<00:05:37.530> sent<00:05:37.710> them<00:05:37.830> back<00:05:37.860> with

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
came and then we sent them back with

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.670 
came and then we sent them back with
supplies<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:40.110> i<00:05:40.170> think<00:05:40.410> that's<00:05:40.530> what

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
supplies and i think that's what

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.130 
supplies and i think that's what
happened<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:41.220> think<00:05:41.550> like<00:05:41.670> an<00:05:41.850> ally<00:05:42.720> generate

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
happened I think like an ally generate

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.440 
happened I think like an ally generate
party<00:05:43.530> happen<00:05:43.860> or<00:05:43.980> something<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.520> remember

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
party happen or something I remember

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.680 
party happen or something I remember
correctly<00:05:45.570> so<00:05:46.110> we'll<00:05:46.380> see<00:05:46.530> once<00:05:46.710> we<00:05:46.800> get<00:05:46.920> there

and then we're gonna go from there I

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.350 
and then we're gonna go from there I
think<00:06:28.860> that<00:06:28.980> would<00:06:29.040> be<00:06:29.160> I<00:06:29.190> still<00:06:29.640> save<00:06:30.090> us<00:06:30.240> some

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
think that would be I still save us some

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.760 
think that would be I still save us some
time<00:06:30.420> other<00:06:30.900> than<00:06:31.080> just<00:06:31.290> walking<00:06:31.590> straight

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
time other than just walking straight

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.710 
time other than just walking straight
over<00:06:31.980> there<00:06:32.100> from<00:06:32.250> where<00:06:32.430> we<00:06:32.580> were<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:33.000> think

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
over there from where we were I think

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.580 
over there from where we were I think
it's<00:06:33.840> gonna<00:06:33.990> say<00:06:34.110> with<00:06:34.230> some<00:06:34.350> time<00:06:34.910> who<00:06:35.910> knows

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
it's gonna say with some time who knows

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.260 
it's gonna say with some time who knows
slim<00:06:37.590> screen<00:06:37.860> takes<00:06:38.310> as<00:06:38.520> long<00:06:38.700> as<00:06:38.850> it<00:06:38.970> is<00:06:39.090> right

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
slim screen takes as long as it is right

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.590 
slim screen takes as long as it is right
now<00:06:39.330> then<00:06:39.720> hell<00:06:40.530> it<00:06:41.220> might<00:06:42.180> not<00:06:42.420> have<00:06:42.570> been

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
now then hell it might not have been

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.570 
now then hell it might not have been
worth<00:06:42.870> it<00:06:44.180> all<00:06:45.180> right<00:06:45.740> must<00:06:46.740> be<00:06:46.890> some<00:06:47.130> Legion

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580
