00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hey, people , youtube, beauty here today. 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.230
 I'll teach how to make an image pnd 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 animated from any other jpeg format and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 etc 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.080
 So you're going to get past a 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.560
 windows operating system because I 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 I think in another system does not give a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 image and I think this is what the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 essential 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.740
 so you will get the image here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 I have the image picked up here said the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.760
 neymar became very famous among blogs 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 of Brazil 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 so here we go the first step is go 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 control panel goes on the control panel. 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.360
 control and not all of us indicated the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 control will appear this if they see 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 in appearance and customization options 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.719
 folder 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 you see in view and will have 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.030
 these places would indicate 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.060
 that you will have to hide the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 extensions of file types 2 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.310

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.970

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.900

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 Yes you can see that it is not animated 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.250
 here we are going to put her to internet 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 give a tour 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.000

 So folks, I came back here, I 'm not even going. 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.689

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 upload but is not here already 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.920
 had made the club that image of this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.049

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 so you come here and go direct link 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.080
 senior forum 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.319
 I think that's right if I do not 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:19.290
 and you have access to it then 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:29.819
 I think you're going to see the flu skirt 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:33.450
 You will load then there is there aaa 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.110
 image is that when copying the image url 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.250
 let's access this url is this one you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.049
 can see that 1 jpg is animated 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.440
 I think I had put png right 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.769
 us what matters is that it's a gif 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 I thought I'd put it on facebook and 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.590
 it works out but I do not think this 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.880
 Not even months behind will spoil facebook. 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 of times 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.700

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.190

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.109
