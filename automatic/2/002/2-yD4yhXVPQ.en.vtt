because<00:00:04.840> the<00:00:04.960> pads<00:00:05.230> worn<00:00:05.649> down<00:00:05.830> some<00:00:06.160> you<00:00:06.279> can

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
because the pads worn down some you can

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.720 
because the pads worn down some you can
see<00:00:06.550> the<00:00:06.670> fluids<00:00:07.060> below<00:00:07.390> the<00:00:07.750> maximum<00:00:08.530> and<00:00:09.099> you

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
see the fluids below the maximum and you

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.490 
see the fluids below the maximum and you
need<00:00:09.910> that<00:00:10.120> because<00:00:10.389> when<00:00:10.780> you<00:00:10.870> compress<00:00:11.260> the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
need that because when you compress the

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.240 
need that because when you compress the
piston<00:00:11.710> you<00:00:12.040> need<00:00:12.220> that<00:00:12.550> fluid<00:00:13.060> that<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.769> going

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
piston you need that fluid that is going

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.370 
piston you need that fluid that is going
to<00:00:15.370> be<00:00:15.550> pushed<00:00:16.240> back<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.359> a<00:00:19.390> place<00:00:19.689> to<00:00:19.900> go<00:00:20.079> you

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
to be pushed back so a place to go you

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.909 
to be pushed back so a place to go you
can<00:00:20.859> also<00:00:21.009> see<00:00:21.310> how<00:00:21.460> dark<00:00:21.909> it<00:00:22.089> is<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:23.619> every

you just screw it on it snug and then

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.449 
you just screw it on it snug and then
you<00:03:19.239> pump<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.739> about<00:03:22.470> 15<00:03:23.470> between<00:03:23.980> 15

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
you pump it up to about 15 between 15

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.849 
you pump it up to about 15 between 15
and<00:03:24.489> 20<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.750> then<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.170> open<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.650> bleed

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
and 20 and then you open up the bleed

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.180 
and 20 and then you open up the bleed
screw<00:03:27.130> till<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.239> runs<00:03:28.420> out<00:03:28.569> clear<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.290> that's

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
screw till it runs out clear and that's

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.730 
screw till it runs out clear and that's
all<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:30.639> to<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.410> just

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
all there is to it just

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.920 
all there is to it just
catch<00:03:33.520> bottle<00:03:35.040> my<00:03:36.040> ten<00:03:36.460> millimeter<00:03:36.970> wrench

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
catch bottle my ten millimeter wrench

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.950 
catch bottle my ten millimeter wrench
attached<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> bleeder<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:40.270> I'll<00:03:40.690> just

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
attached to the bleeder and I'll just

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.580 
attached to the bleeder and I'll just
open<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.380> sucker<00:03:41.830> up<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.690> watch<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.380> run<00:03:44.590> out

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.570 

and<00:03:50.590> once<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.400> comes<00:03:51.670> out<00:03:51.910> clear<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.580> I'll

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and once it comes out clear and I'll

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.600 
and once it comes out clear and I'll
just<00:03:54.850> shut<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.180> off

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
just shut it off

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:07.040 
just shut it off
and<00:03:57.610> move<00:03:58.450> on<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.110> next<00:03:59.350> one

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.480 

and<00:04:07.710> it<00:04:08.010> does<00:04:08.220> usually<00:04:08.610> take<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> while<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.150> so

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
and it does usually take a while to so

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.100 
and it does usually take a while to so
go<00:04:11.490> ahead<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.730> cut<00:04:11.970> off<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.270> camera<00:04:12.630> it's

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
go ahead and cut off the camera it's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.130 
go ahead and cut off the camera it's
gone<00:04:13.350> from<00:04:13.620> looking<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:13.950> sweet<00:04:14.550> tea<00:04:15.140> to

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
gone from looking like sweet tea to

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.830 
gone from looking like sweet tea to
clear<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.010> I'll<00:04:17.130> go<00:04:17.280> ahead<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.700> close<00:04:18.600> this

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
clear so I'll go ahead and close this

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.570 
clear so I'll go ahead and close this
side<00:04:19.080> off<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.650> we'll<00:04:19.830> move<00:04:20.130> on

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
side off and we'll move on

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.640 
side off and we'll move on
all<00:04:20.670> right<00:04:20.910> I've<00:04:21.060> finished<00:04:21.650> pressure

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
all right I've finished pressure

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
all right I've finished pressure
bleeding<00:04:23.130> all<00:04:23.280> four<00:04:23.670> wheels<00:04:24.980> at<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.130> calipers

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
bleeding all four wheels at the calipers

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.840 
bleeding all four wheels at the calipers
and<00:04:26.910> now<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:28.020> relieve<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.500> pressure<00:04:28.850> remove

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
and now just relieve the pressure remove

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.390 
and now just relieve the pressure remove
the<00:04:30.000> cap<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:31.380> really<00:04:31.650> don't<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.160> top

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the cap and I really don't have to top

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.310 
the cap and I really don't have to top
it<00:04:32.580> off<00:04:32.700> because<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.360> naturally<00:04:36.320> finishes

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
it off because it naturally finishes

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.370 
it off because it naturally finishes
right<00:04:37.560> at<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> max<00:04:38.100> line<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:39.600> when<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:39.960> remove

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
right at the max line so when I remove

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.200 
right at the max line so when I remove
the<00:04:40.410> cap<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.160> liquid<00:04:41.520> falls<00:04:41.760> out<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.030> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
the cap and that liquid falls out of the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.470 
the cap and that liquid falls out of the
hose<00:04:42.420> it<00:04:42.660> should<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.020> exactly<00:04:43.410> correct<00:04:44.090> at<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
hose it should be exactly correct at the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.020 
hose it should be exactly correct at the
max<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.080> never<00:04:46.200> place<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.830> brown<00:04:47.100> looking

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
brakes with the engine off and I'll pump

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.990
