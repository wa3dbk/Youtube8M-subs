00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

any of you as you can see it's much

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
any of you as you can see it's much
larger<00:00:36.360> what's<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.530> interesting<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
larger what's very interesting is that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
larger what's very interesting is that
you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:39.120> how<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.989> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you can actually see how much of a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290 
you can actually see how much of a
difference<00:00:40.770> actually<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.430> been<00:00:41.640> made<00:00:41.910> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
difference actually has been made in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
difference actually has been made in
terms<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> making<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.290> much<00:00:43.440> smaller<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
terms of making it much smaller how in

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.529 
terms of making it much smaller how in
the<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:45.090> tomato<00:00:45.660> view<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:47.039> example<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.000> lot

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the a tomato view for example was a lot

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.490 
the a tomato view for example was a lot
bigger<00:00:49.280> in<00:00:50.480> comparison<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> agent<00:00:52.199> ready

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
bigger in comparison to the agent ready

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.639 
bigger in comparison to the agent ready
so<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:55.440> not

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so that is actually really good did not

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.790 
so that is actually really good did not
has<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.129> done<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.789> job<00:00:56.850> dad<00:00:57.710> just<00:00:58.710> you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
spec sheet is very similar to what

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.360 
spec sheet is very similar to what
people<00:02:09.429> yesterday<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.509> similar<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
people yesterday and a similar to the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580 
people yesterday and a similar to the
920<00:02:12.370> itself<00:02:12.760> XFS<00:02:13.090> 2gb<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.540> RAM<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.020> won't<00:02:14.500> go

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
920 itself XFS 2gb of RAM I won't go

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.290 
920 itself XFS 2gb of RAM I won't go
over<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> right<00:02:15.070> now<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.610> basically

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
over that right now because basically

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.570 
over that right now because basically
the<00:02:16.720> UI<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.680> performance<00:02:18.190> wise<00:02:18.400> is

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the UI and the performance wise is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.050 
the UI and the performance wise is
