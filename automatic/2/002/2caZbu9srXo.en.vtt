went in survival mode and did it

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.640 
went in survival mode and did it
properly<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:01.090> when<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.570> survival<00:03:02.170> mode<00:03:02.350> and

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
my this as you can see it just drops its

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
block and here in this furnace I've

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
block and here in this furnace I've
showed<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.470> what<00:03:08.799> happens<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.820> smelt

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
showed you what happens if you smelt

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.690 
showed you what happens if you smelt
this<00:03:10.269> but<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> call<00:03:10.870> or<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.320> do<00:03:11.650> believe<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.579> it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
this but a call or I do believe that it

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.650 
this but a call or I do believe that it
only<00:03:12.880> works<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.480> put<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> call<00:03:14.680> at<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.579> moment

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
only works with put a call at the moment

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.870 
only works with put a call at the moment
it<00:03:16.660> might<00:03:17.049> actually<00:03:17.170> work<00:03:17.380> with<00:03:17.500> call<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.160> will

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
it might actually work with call I will

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.970 
it might actually work with call I will
check<00:03:19.320> yeah<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.410> does<00:03:20.500> actually<00:03:20.530> work<00:03:20.859> with

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
check yeah it does actually work with

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.150 
check yeah it does actually work with
call<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:22.600> not<00:03:22.900> just<00:03:22.959> put<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.350> goal<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:24.010> that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
call it's not just put a goal but that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.470 
call it's not just put a goal but that
actually<00:03:24.340> gets<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> buttering<00:03:25.180> go<00:03:25.269> that's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
actually gets you a buttering go that's

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.940 
actually gets you a buttering go that's
how<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:25.630> get<00:03:25.810> yourself<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.290> put<00:03:26.620> her<00:03:26.680> anger

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
how you get yourself a put her anger

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.979 
how you get yourself a put her anger
which<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.400> obviously<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.209> be<00:03:28.299> used<00:03:28.540> to

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
which is obviously going to be used to

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.240 
which is obviously going to be used to
craft<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.359> tools<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.650> armors<00:03:33.040> I

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
craft the tools and and the armors I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.979 
craft the tools and and the armors I
have<00:03:33.609> actually<00:03:33.940> tried<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.209> craft<00:03:34.630> them<00:03:34.810> but

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
have actually tried to craft them but

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.210 
have actually tried to craft them but
it's<00:03:35.109> not<00:03:35.410> working<00:03:35.590> at<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.920> world<00:03:36.130> would

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it's not working at the world would

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's not working at the world would
there's<00:03:36.400> no<00:03:36.519> butter<00:03:36.700> sticks<00:03:37.000> or<00:03:37.180> anything

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
there's no butter sticks or anything

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.470 
there's no butter sticks or anything
like<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.070> can't<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.760> can't<00:03:40.000> craft

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
like that so you can't you can't craft

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.509 
like that so you can't you can't craft
those<00:03:40.660> really<00:03:41.199> and<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.250> also<00:03:42.400> called

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
those really and this is also called

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.460 
those really and this is also called
boutique<00:03:43.030> hola<00:03:43.419> which<00:03:43.660> I'm<00:03:43.810> guessing<00:03:44.049> once

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
boutique hola which I'm guessing once

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.370 
boutique hola which I'm guessing once
you<00:03:44.680> minor<00:03:44.949> in<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.280> future<00:03:45.699> it's<00:03:45.910> going<00:03:45.970> to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
you minor in the future it's going to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.330 
you minor in the future it's going to
up<00:03:46.440> into<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.220> protocol<00:03:47.850> but<00:03:48.450> at<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.660> moment

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
up into the protocol but at the moment

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.500 
up into the protocol but at the moment
nothing<00:03:50.340> currently<00:03:50.520> works<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.300> it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
nothing currently works with that it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.630 
nothing currently works with that it
hopefully<00:03:51.930> when<00:03:52.860> it's<00:03:53.040> fixed<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.520> will

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
hopefully when it's fixed it will

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.960 
hopefully when it's fixed it will
actually<00:03:53.930> turn<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.320> stuff<00:03:55.680> Cole<00:03:56.670> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
actually turn it to this stuff Cole and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.630 
actually turn it to this stuff Cole and
butter<00:03:57.440> yes<00:03:58.440> which<00:03:59.250> will<00:03:59.460> burn<00:03:59.790> things<00:04:00.480> great

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
butter yes which will burn things great

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.880 
butter yes which will burn things great
if<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.700> go<00:04:03.180> back<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.570> tools<00:04:03.810> over<00:04:04.110> here<00:04:04.140> I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
if we go back to the tools over here I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.370 
if we go back to the tools over here I
didn't<00:04:05.520> mention<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.180> these<00:04:06.780> are<00:04:07.020> actually

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
didn't mention that these are actually

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.320 
didn't mention that these are actually
the<00:04:07.410> same<00:04:07.620> durability<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.760> strength<00:04:09.030> is

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the same durability and strength is

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.560 
the same durability and strength is
diamond<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.110> do<00:04:10.470> believe<00:04:11.160> they're<00:04:11.820> exactly<00:04:12.330> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
diamond I do believe they're exactly the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.530 
diamond I do believe they're exactly the
same<00:04:12.720> at<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.080> moment<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.590> did<00:04:14.130> test<00:04:15.120> those<00:04:15.330> out

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
same at the moment I did test those out

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.930 
same at the moment I did test those out
and<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:16.410> do<00:04:16.770> actually<00:04:17.130> seem<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.580> be<00:04:17.700> exactly

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
and they do actually seem to be exactly

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.260 
and they do actually seem to be exactly
the<00:04:18.630> same<00:04:18.770> however<00:04:19.910> they're<00:04:20.910> made<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.120> of

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
the same however they're made out of

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.090 
the same however they're made out of
butter<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:22.500> diamond<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.630> yes<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
butter not diamond so yes this is the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.920 
butter not diamond so yes this is the
