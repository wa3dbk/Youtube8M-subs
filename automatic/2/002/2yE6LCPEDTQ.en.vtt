 hi hi sene jeanne meet again 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.590
 today for the advent of the 100th 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.390
 breakfast i hope you're here 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.050
 in any case it is something of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.760
 memorable 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.900
 I really wanted to thank you already 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.910
 by voice because we are 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 arrived at the 100th video of this concept 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.420
 I really did not think about 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.160
 departure I would go so far it was a 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.080
 little test I was told opening the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.700
 morning of a booster and well it could 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.590
 amplify my rhythm of videos and in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.449
 same time maybe and well stand out me 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.070
 make you happy I do not know and he 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.600
 really knows that this concept has 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.370
 really made his way 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.390
 you loved anyway 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.730
 I always had good feedback 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.530
 positive on it so here I wanted to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.600
 make you happy to make a mark 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.979
 for the hundredth breakfast and I 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.659
 we pulled out one of the boosters that 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.979
 resided in my window since not very 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.170
 long at the base I had bought 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.250
 for me but after a week the south 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.150
 immediate and his old little ax 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.010
 who are coming in maybe we should 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 plan something memorable and 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.909
 that's why I reserve and express them 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.650
 for the hundredth breakfast he 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.170
 is an ex French booster but 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.390
 favorite booster already basic and in addition 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.010
 an export booster hiding a series 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.960
 very mysterious who has cards 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.670
 really very very very very very very beautiful 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.469
 this is the first time I'm going 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.909
 open on my channel by cons there is 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.829
 already had on youtube I'm not sure 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.810
 all the first darko was 0.22 had 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.860
 did there have been teddy as low all or 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.789
 period I want to 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.409
 thank you vocally 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.149
 because it's him who gives me the proof 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.920
 finally most of my old booster 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.869
 and it's thanks to him that we still have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.399
 booster at breakfast so went to see his 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.560
 chain and that's a frankly thanks to 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.210
 you friend and today we will 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.420
 find my turn so that I can 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.520
 open a booster of this series 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.799
 he's just super badass he's just 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.759
 beautiful I deliberately chose 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.990
 the rake illustration or because I 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.549
 find it too beautiful I have a big 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.189
 favorite for her even if nathalie 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.659
 is my favorite ray balls so much 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.399
 mysterious is so beautiful that 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.409
 I love so I put a fund to 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.899
 the ricou effigy necessarily because these 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.399
 booster pokemon and we're going to go to the 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.999
 discovering to boost himself and to his 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.829
 opening 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.850
 I will really take my time because 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.420
 that it's boosters that I did not 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.490
 never open 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.810
 by the way it's a booster ex I love 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.069
 open up is so you will understand 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.020
 that I will really take my time 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.630
 it is of course the illustrations and 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.790
 here is the description of the boosters done 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.530
 poses frankly it's worth the detour and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.580
 we left I went to the open 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.530
 booster 100th booster breakfast 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.730
 rex go to hide oh la la la la la 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.850
 schedules punishment one of these boosters 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 he was good in the showcase 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.620
 hahahahahahaha so the placement of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.410
 cards 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 apparently I do not know the placement 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.270
 cards but I have the impression that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.590
 it's the first 3 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.450
 so I'll immediately put them to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.650
 the end because if there is a star etc 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.390
 franck it's a third card I know 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.700
 it's so complicated 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.170
 boosters ex I took 3 I took the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.920
 first three we will see the next 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.920
 the end go we start with a pokemon 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.530
 it's about chills she's deadly 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.959
 I love this pokemon already low evolution 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.580
 and recent broadcast fairy are a 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.830
 super rebel family of the second 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.930
 generation and it's a super beautiful 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.220
 card i love i have no card from 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.000
 this series in the collection since 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.930
 for my kid we keep my windows if 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 I can call it like that in the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.720
 ninjas language it's really 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 to complete my collection only by 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.190
 booster openings and when he misses 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.750
 one or two cards there I buy but 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 here I intend to complete this series a 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.019
 day when we open boosters 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.630
 I have hope I hope I live 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.480
 but it's my it's my second goal 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.799
 that's the energy in the second card 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.590
 beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.880
 we continue with bourillon it's not 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.989
 classic as an illustration because 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.799
 normally for tastes and pokemon 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.420
 another dimension 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.250
 and there is seen an air field 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.380
 in this way fight someone was going 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.420
 very beautiful the map we then chained 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.910
 with nature this one I know her very 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.190
 very well against it is chained with ti 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.690
 late then comes back against a small 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.859
 role moment in the cards and a 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.810
 another little late who knows how to break the 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.280
 just right behind I have no comment 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.049
 he did not walk right but 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.880
 it's not serious but against her and 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.079
 she is really very very beautiful the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.030
 card frankly she has charm 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.700
 with the landscape behind again the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.230
 detour a chain with snow ball I 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.670
 do not like at all this christmas I do not know 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.209
 you but it's not at all my pokemon 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.370
 we continue with what we come to 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.870
 good map there rivers it's an energy 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.579
 how do I recognize that say never say 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.170
 down we have the acronym of the ex series 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.320
 hidden forces that is in the corner at 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.890
 right of the illustration so a super 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.890
 beautiful aignan 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.750
 I love a holographic energy then 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.829
 at the base in addition and a rare I think 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.480
 not that this energy there and all praise 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.460
 at the base so it's a very good 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.140
 pick very very good very beautiful 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.340
 rivers are very good booster it wants 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.010
 to say that we will have at least two rare 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.470
 a booster and then we will have these 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.750
 parts 1 and liquids with rare ah that's 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.830
 it's not lucky but we see there 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.880
 excuse me I made a small break 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.050
 because it creates axon very much 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.940
 outside and there were bikers 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.650
 so we were at and the kids 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 Henrard is good to let go of the panels 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.470
 graphic but so far that makes me 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.180
 pleasure because I find that kids 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.950
 has a lot of charm so I do not know if 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.730
 it's a modeling clay figurines in 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.020
 Anyway it's not an illustration 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.930
 as usual you have noticed 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.430
 it's a pokemon a pokemon baby so 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.810
 Lille has charm I'm happy 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.000
 I do not care quite graphic 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 or an ultra at least we have beautiful 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.900
 cards I'm happy and the last 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.000
 was it an ultra rare or a 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.290
 star it's gone no it was a skin 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.510
 common because in these series there in 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.910
 general to an ultra rare replaces the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.010
 third card I think a good brief 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.140
 black fang that is pretty good too 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.360
 frankly frankly frankly very 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.520
 very good mystery we did not have any 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.600
 the aude ultra that's a shame but for 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.979
 as much as I'm happy 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.419
 to have opened this booster it was the 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.310
 first time for me that I opened 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.390
 hidden strengths and I'm not disappointed 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.490
 have frankly it's a very very 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.590
 beautiful series I hope in the future can 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.690
 to reopen others because frankly she 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.880
 well worth the detour knee but the 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.650
 boost one of the blows in the corner and we 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.330
 is finished with this hundredth small 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.620
 lunch i hope it will have made you 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.120
 pleasure it was longer used 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.530
 but inevitably it is not a series 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.630
 that you will see every day then 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.650
 I really took my time I wanted 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.910
 also tell you what future now 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.560
 the noro breakfasts over 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.760
 numbers because now reaches the 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.160
 hundredth breakfast I would not put 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.290
 that breakfast as a tag in front of 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.400
 titles of p'tits why not why 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.729
 that otherwise we could wait for 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.200
 breakfast 998 3200 francs here we go 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.669
 not to do like this until infinity 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.500
 I do not know how long 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.030
 will last this concept maybe until the 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.800
 end of the match one day I do not know 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.690
 at all but as far as I spent a 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.310
 great breakfast in your company 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.610
 I hope the opening to booster 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.990
 ex you will have fun and you will have 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.740
 really pleased and I tell you 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.180

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.530
 new breakfast and so far wear 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.530
