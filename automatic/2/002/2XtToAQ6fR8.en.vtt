00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.850 
shouldn't be that far you don't want too
much<00:00:12.030> thread<00:00:12.389> or<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.139> will<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.380> hard<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> sell

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
much thread or it will be hard to sell

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.609 
much thread or it will be hard to sell
and<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:15.269> we're<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.109> pick<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.470> our

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and now we're going to pick up our

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.269 
and now we're going to pick up our
scissors<00:00:17.180> cut<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> thread<00:00:18.539> off<00:00:19.010> keep<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
scissors cut that thread off keep it in

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000 
scissors cut that thread off keep it in
our<00:00:20.400> hands<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.500> put<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
our hands and we're going to put the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.509 
our hands and we're going to put the
spool<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> thread<00:00:23.460> away<00:00:24.320> now<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> trick<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> when

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
spool of thread away now a trick is when

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.910 
spool of thread away now a trick is when
you<00:00:26.730> cut<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.000> thread<00:00:27.420> try<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> cut<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.560> an

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you cut your thread try and cut it on an

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.010 
you cut your thread try and cut it on an
angle<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.719> makes<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
angle like this and it just makes it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.420 
angle like this and it just makes it
easier<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> sew<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:36.140> keep<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.649> thread<00:00:38.280> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
easier to sew so keep that thread in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.720 
easier to sew so keep that thread in
your<00:00:38.550> hand<00:00:38.790> grab<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.690> needle<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.280> use<00:00:41.280> my

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
your hand grab your needle I use my

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
your hand grab your needle I use my
right<00:00:42.000> hand<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.629> hold<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> thread<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:43.829> left

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
right hand to hold the thread my left

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
right hand to hold the thread my left
hand<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> hold<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> needle<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> point

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
hand to hold the needle at this point

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
hand to hold the needle at this point
we're<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.410> try<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> thread<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
we're gonna try and get the thread to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.869 
we're gonna try and get the thread to
that<00:00:47.730> tiny<00:00:48.210> hole<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> needle<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that tiny hole in the needle and this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
that tiny hole in the needle and this
can<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> hardest<00:00:51.360> part<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.809> sewing<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
can be the hardest part of sewing but it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
can be the hardest part of sewing but it
will<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> couple<00:00:54.329> tries<00:00:54.980> totally

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
will take you a couple tries totally

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.369 
will take you a couple tries totally
worth<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.370> wow<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.020> through<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
worth it wow I just got that through in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.459 
worth it wow I just got that through in
one<00:00:58.559> shot<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.460> never<00:00:59.820> happens<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.660> think

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
one shot that like never happens I think

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.319 
one shot that like never happens I think
it's<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> trick<00:01:02.789> cutting<00:01:03.239> your

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it's because of that trick cutting your

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
it's because of that trick cutting your
thread<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.629> an<00:01:03.930> angle<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> show

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
thread on an angle so I'm going to show

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.660 
thread on an angle so I'm going to show
you<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> again<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.710> hole<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you that again there is the hole in the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.410 
you that again there is the hole in the
needle<00:01:09.409> there<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:10.890> there

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
needle there it is right there

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
hole in one thread in hole in one so now

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.999 
hole in one thread in hole in one so now
grab<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.549> needle<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.939> your<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.240> hand

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
grab your needle with your right hand

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.170 
grab your needle with your right hand
gently<00:01:32.009> pull<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.490> thread<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.000> left

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gently pull your thread with your left

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.080 
gently pull your thread with your left
and<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.880> the

and you what you want to do is make the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
and you what you want to do is make the
ends<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> thread<00:01:37.079> meet<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.460> keep

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
ends of the thread meet so just keep

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
ends of the thread meet so just keep
pulling<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.329> until<00:01:41.180> they're<00:01:42.180> roughly<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
pulling it until they're roughly the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.179 
pulling it until they're roughly the
same<00:01:43.680> length<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> you'll<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.960> pull<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.619> pull

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
same length so you'll just pull one pull

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
same length so you'll just pull one pull
the<00:01:47.340> other<00:01:47.490> until<00:01:48.210> they're<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:50.130> same

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the other until they're kind of the same

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.760 
the other until they're kind of the same
length<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> bottom<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.049> that's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
length at the bottom there we go that's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.179 
length at the bottom there we go that's
pretty<00:01:53.070> even<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.170> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> smooth<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
pretty even now you want to smooth the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
pretty even now you want to smooth the
thread<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> few<00:01:57.030> times<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.659> fingers

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
thread a few times with your fingers

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.980
