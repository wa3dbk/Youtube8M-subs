00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.240 
to before I could really fall in love
with<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:31.210> place<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.530> biggest<00:01:32.740> challenge

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
with this place the biggest challenge

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.580 
with this place the biggest challenge
for<00:01:33.399> me<00:01:33.490> when<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.700> first<00:01:33.880> came<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.179> Hsu<00:01:34.869> was

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
for me when I first came to Hsu was

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.039 
for me when I first came to Hsu was
probably<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.729> large<00:01:37.149> size<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.659> campus

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
probably the large size of the campus

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.959 
probably the large size of the campus
compared<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.920> small<00:01:39.159> high<00:01:39.340> school<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> came

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
compared to the small high school I came

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.270 
compared to the small high school I came
from<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.479> also<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.530> distance<00:01:41.950> from<00:01:42.159> my

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280

family<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.789> Washington<00:01:43.359> I<00:01:43.570> think<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.560> hardest

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
family in Washington I think the hardest

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.800 
family in Washington I think the hardest
