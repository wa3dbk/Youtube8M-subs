00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi friends from youtube I'm going to talk about 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 new the mx and in this video I will talk to you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.820
 about this device which is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:17.240
 a 5-inch tablet 5 is small 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.720
 and this video will be divided into two 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.800
 sections which will be the things 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.250
 good and bad things have more things 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.670
 bad how good this tablet will start 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.730
 with the good in the good I something that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.460
 good is that it is 6 inches and which 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.220
 makes it fit perfectly in your 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.050
 pocket 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.050
 he also has flash player 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.790
 here is our flash player stand 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.400
 and the screen is capacitive this wants 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.110
 say it's sensitive not like some 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.350
 that you have to press hard to 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.300
 that grip this one is not sensitive a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.170
 simple touch so small and you're 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 opening 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.330
 this time and now I will talk to you about 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 the bad things 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 the bad thing is that they do not bring back camera 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 it comes without any rear camera 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.620
 no rear camera is not 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.620
 has bluetooth which is quite 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.420
 disappointing 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.820
 since if you want to connect your hearing aids 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.920
 wireless or pass some file not 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.600
 you are going to be able to look here in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 settings should appear on 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.680
 bluetooth but it does not appear 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.840
 to see another thing is that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.570
 the android version is already a bit 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.310
 ancient 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 has android 4.0 point 4 I will show you 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.100
 of configurations about the cable 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.760
 the investment of android 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.050
 up to four points 0.4 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.050
 when ice cream sandwich 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 they do not look like dolls that you have to 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.610
 Appear 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.590
 also a bad thing is that sometimes it's 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.620
 very slow the tablet when you have 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.230
 open several applications to whoever 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.770
 in multitasking and it takes 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.340
 very much or you see the delay that has 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.819
 when closing 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.370
 when you open them here, for example, 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.849
 one window to another from one page to another 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.580
 You see it 's fast but sometimes they go up 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.000
 very slow for example happens if you see 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.470
 that goes so direct or happens to here is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810
 well they are violent or you 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.750
 they understand 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.260
 to see this tablet acquiring from 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.480
 run at a price of 990 pesos which 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.860
 is a cheap price for that set is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.080
 a fair price since you're not paying 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 Well, something of very good quality 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.670
 I tell you about your 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.360
 technical specifications has a 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.000
 mononucleus processor 1 hertz point

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:37.360

 with record video and the battery is 2000 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.090
 thousand companies the amp if they have any 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.650
 ask about this tablet 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.689
 do not doubt in 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.629
 put me down here in the comments 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.790

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.849
 reserved your question if you want it to run 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.439
 some game tell me and I run it in the 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.110
 tablet to see if it suits them or 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.550
 it does not suit them 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.550
