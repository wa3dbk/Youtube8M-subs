00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 good morning good afternoon and good 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.250
 I'm giving your nights in the main 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.950
 for fun in the last chapter of how 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.950
 make your home welcome 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.550
 7 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.470
 good kids we are in the last 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.440
 episode a pity to everything a whole 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.470
 record all my mother a few hours that 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.270
 we've gone to that together in this in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.910
 this in this series of how to make your house 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.940
 teaching the secret tricks of the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.470
 decoration and construction we remember 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.290
 that in chapter number nine we just 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.879
 the garden without sheep there I see that a 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.300
 sheep that has sneaked by I do not know where 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.430
 but but we finished the garden and in this 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.260
 last chapter we will go through the house 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.610
 within agreement we will enter by all 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.660
 the corners and we will go out in the garden 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.730
 we remember that we did the kitchen here and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.370
 the dining room so we see everything 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.390
 Right 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.670
 with pictures 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.240
 to see the light also 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 it's all good 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.090
 It's worth missing here, I think a little 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.090
 decoration here of plants 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.700
 I think something is scarce this 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700
 Let's see 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.100
 this is this practice is we going to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.100
 put a little here 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.710
 and at the entrance I always like that 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.000
 the tickets have 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.000
 and a little bit of 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.110
 of little flowers we go up to see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 I think it's rooms we already reviewed the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.850
 room here a 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 Room 20 is the double that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 communicated with the sink 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.070
 the hall another room with his 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.860
 correct desktop 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 these guys finish a stowage of a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 pity but we will not come back with another 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 series surely 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.730
 little by little always something always something 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 what to do here is worth the bowling alley 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.340
 provisional bowling that came out of the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.340
 summits of mordor 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.420
 a minibar waited for us in a room 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.310
 apocalyptic in a recreational machine 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.540
 no, it was not shocking this room was 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.480
 fussed agreement already what here was the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.580
 fantastic car 'the tank or the shit 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.410
 dry I do not know what the hell we did here 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150
 but hey it was something provisional for 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.100
 to see how good that there was a car 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.470
 that out here my mother with this fit 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.780
 five cars here yes with a tank already 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.910
 occupy all this my mother good then 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.800
 we have here the east corridor that we 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.940
 It overlooked the garden 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.060
 the garden that there is there is a garden that 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.390
 here something is missing to see if it is a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.950
 see if you know that it is neither more nor 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.950
 less than lighting guys 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.740
 lighting that we have put 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.990
 to see where the streetlights are you are here 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.380
 are going to see let's put here the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.380
 lanterns 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.030
 every time 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.140
 we're going to upload this a little bit more 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.140
 here 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.440
 lanterns here posts let's put a 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.960
 couple more by the pool we're going to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.680
 separate them a little bit that is going to put 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.680
 here the tide to someone 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.350
 to see height to the same I think it was 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.350
 A) Yes 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.370
 but a little bit short of what I see 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.200
 let's upload the good plus one more 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.200
 Well that's fine 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.650
 is quad of 5 then 1 2 3 4 and 5 very 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.650
 all right 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.640
 Here's one here and one outside by 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.640
 that we are going to put here supported on the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.270
 one two three four and one more 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.270
 very well 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.910
 here we will make a beacon the adhered 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.169
 what 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.910
 on the facade of the house itself 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.670
 On the side 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.110
 here we can another 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.110
 and if it is 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.190
 with this background music mother of mine that 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.190
 it is something apocalyptic 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.270
 very cool the music yes sir 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.910
 here another and I think it was worth 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.680
 outside we had another kind of berries that 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.680
 are is here so we will put 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.759
 1 2 3 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.190
 45 1 2 3 4 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.300
 and 5 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.020
 and there it is 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.020
 wepa 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.210
 OK 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.720
 ok let's continue in the pool in 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.720
 the outside garden 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.330
 here we could see how it is here 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.030
 I think this is already 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.830
 For we have gone over pretty quickly 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.520
 the house is if I'm not wrong until 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.520
 still full 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.050
 I will leave ahead 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.290
 you are right 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.740
 the truth is that yes I think that up 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.790
 this we are going to put the last agreements 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.790
 and we put 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:17.790
 we did not put this, it seems to me that way 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:21.590
 precious now yes 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.590
 Well, I think this 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.710
 would miss the roof guys but let's 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.990
 put straight so because if it's not a 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.050
 pasture of time 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.080
 it's a long time of agreement 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.870
 I think the lighting was all me 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.560
 here it seems if the upstairs 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.770
 yes, I still do if this has 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.389
 finished in this episode at number 10 of 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.610
 how to make your house in a pretty series 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:56.120
 productive the truth is that if we have 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:00.590
 taught a little tricks we have 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.039
 taught ways of doing things 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.509
 make objects to take advantage of materials and 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.400
 we will try that in the next 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.600
 chapters we already have the version of 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.579
 Minecraft 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.739
 improved 

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:17.169
 more good indeed the new version 

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:18.639
 of bukit that are still developing 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.439
 but well let's hope that no 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.289
 ship we are going to do tests with the 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:27.729
 new materials and nothing to think about another 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:29.339
 kind of tutorial or serial or 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:33.489
 construction with new materials 

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:35.919
 so guys I do not say goodbye here 

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:37.479
 Mr. Radar Tuzsa in May for Fun and 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.429
