00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.660
 rock is that that vibrates within our 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.910
 that turns on and appealing to the most 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.000
 deep of us makes us pop 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.940
 because rock is that essence that seeks 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.090
 expand that maelstrom of feelings 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.190
 that need to be freed from the port that 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.310
 is what we are looking for and can give us the 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.369
 rock that force is to burst in a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 moment the rock is that, so the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.980
 rock use it carefully 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.160
 [Music] 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.989
 growing that magnificent phenomenon by the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 which an embryo becomes a sweet 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.420
 baby then in a tender child to pass 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.460
 then to be an adolescent idealist and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 eventually become a asshole 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.910
 or something even worse like Mariano Grondona 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.250
 You require an essential factor 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.589
 grow needs something that is opposed 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.050
 so that constantly that grows 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.870
 Strengthen and train yourself by overcoming 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.839
 disadvantages that arise to him we see 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.699
 to this musical group you are looking for 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.050
 constantly to his opponent well there 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.050
 is your inspiration 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.610
 the well-known producer spencer catch play 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.100
 insists on continuing to promote one of 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.960
 its most promising bands is about 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.850
 the browns would be good now 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.009
 guitar a drumstick presents you the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 guitar and marc and browns in batteries 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.840
 although chains where they are dwarfs 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.159
 [Music] 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.209
 the browns many repertoires and those in 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.340
 songs against the police without 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.340
 trying to deepen his career 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.440
 well we know that to have blessed 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.900
 with what we do, the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 tail guitarist said we had to 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.260
 have speed is what we do and to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 that we should have more problems 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.430
 with the police but we do not have it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.870
 still so we 're working a lot 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.280
 for that to continue composing and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.280
 having problems with the police 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.090
 you also learn 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.690
 [Music] 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.640
 Cold and I also have a stuffy nose

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.600
 [Music] 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.020
 and you take care only with those 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.020
 caritas 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.690
 and that and more advice like a grandmother who 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.430
 I thought that this plan did not have results 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.340
 but then he says easy try with the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.050
 marijuana redoubled their cocaine bet 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.480
 at a bar table to see if it's in 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.100
 I still have problems every month to my 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.330
 brother in line of merca and elba llama 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.250
 the police the police suits me have 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.720
 because we are going to take cocaine reflects me 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.720
 in that camera 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.980
 but they also failed two days later 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.780
 they wanted to offend the authority with the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.520
 joy attempt to make an exhibition 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.520
 the scenes of his naked buttocks 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:42.909
 our police is a move 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.400
 but unfortunately the attempt also 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.489
 failed and in the last days they came to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.560
 a bolder plan to perpetrate an invasion 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.569
 privately owned as the resale 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.310
 list that strives at the door people 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.750
 sure the police are coming for the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.069
 issue of private property view that 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.889

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.310
 Sometimes very thing I entered the silver lining 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.810
 police and alarm the police goes well and 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.340
 has the truths that something has come 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:12.629

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.629
 open the door of truth 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.440
 he is also meditating lagarde 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.340

 you are heroes nobody collaborates with the 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.830
 police as much as you inadvertently 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.780
 they solved a case 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.639
 we live from the police that is what is 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.860
 She makes him talking to mouth 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.539

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.889
 browns were decorated by the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.870
 police and this one they surrendered a 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.280
 tribute in the central department of 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.690
 the same this does not help them 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.409
