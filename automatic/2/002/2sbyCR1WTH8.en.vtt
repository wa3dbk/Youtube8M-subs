00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
the natural oils of your skin and if

the natural oils of your skin and if

you've got an oily skin type this is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you've got an oily skin type this is
going<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.130> actually<00:01:43.310> make<00:01:44.300> things<00:01:44.510> worse<00:01:44.720> and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
going to actually make things worse and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.780 
going to actually make things worse and
what<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:46.790> mean<00:01:47.030> by<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.840> if<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:49.340> oils

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
what I mean by this is that if your oils

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.880 
what I mean by this is that if your oils
are<00:01:50.090> stripped<00:01:50.570> from<00:01:50.750> your<00:01:51.020> skin<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
are stripped from your skin with the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.770 
are stripped from your skin with the
burning<00:01:52.190> sensation<00:01:52.400> then<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.360> skin<00:01:53.720> is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
burning sensation then your skin is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.690 
burning sensation then your skin is
thinking<00:01:54.470> that's<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.280> haven't<00:01:55.580> got<00:01:55.670> enough

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
thinking that's you haven't got enough

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.610 
thinking that's you haven't got enough
oils<00:01:56.300> there<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.600> protect<00:01:56.750> your<00:01:57.140> skin<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.470> it's

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
oils there to protect your skin so it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.980 
oils there to protect your skin so it's
going<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.860> over<00:01:58.220> produce<00:01:58.610> which<00:01:59.330> actually

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
going to over produce which actually

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.460 
going to over produce which actually
makes<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.320> problem<00:02:00.350> worse<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:01.070> start<00:02:01.370> with

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
makes the problem worse to start with

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.140 
makes the problem worse to start with
