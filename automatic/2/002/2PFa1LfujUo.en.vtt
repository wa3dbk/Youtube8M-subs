00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.190
 this day the real Spain has given no doubt 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 the surprise of the tournament has hired 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 for the closing championship the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 services of the Honduran attacker Carlos 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.780
 costly mateo yibrín president of the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.269
 institution made the official presentation 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.240
 of the attacker who will play with the number 13 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.060
 in the real Spain 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.950
 very very happy for the signing of 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.070
 Carlos costly for three reasons 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.580
 important number one we have a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.330
 goal scorer 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.080
 more in the group in search of the coveted 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.059
 bicampeonato number 2 we are going to cut 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.860
 our bit as always 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.120
 has done real Spain with the national team 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.400
 national for man the man 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is then garage pliego of the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.970
 selection so you can get the best 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.970
 way to brazil 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.920
 and the third reason 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.079
 Well happy to have power 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 make a Honduran signing that is going to 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.540
 give much importance to the national league 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.210
 only if a very good offer comes out 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.399
 would costly go abroad what 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 will play the entire tournament of 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.470
 closing with the machine 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.690
 well let's cut 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.240
 here with the group 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.000
 to try to follow the team 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.260
 looking for him 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.990
 and championship and I hope to be in order 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.000
 next to them I like the team in the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.110
 time is my family has played here my 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 uncle my company 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.570
 and he was caught fond of the institution 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.880
 besides reinforcing the attack of the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.930
 Owls costly will keep pace in 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.040
 the months leading up to the world championship 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 also for help 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 personally for me I think something 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.210
 must be here in the country 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.210
 also for the selection that is something 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.299
 important to be in rhythm and I think 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 that here we speak with Matthew and 4 already 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.440
 we are here to overcome rivals 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.910
 are the clear conditions 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.890
 weather conditions 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.570
 pick up rhythm so that the idea we have 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.570
 handled with mateo I think that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.230
 I want to stay here for a while 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.220
 work with peers to follow 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 the same path that I have come up 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.670
 this moment and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 and if we see the conditions then we are going to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.140
 be all the time with mateo yibrín has 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.879
 made it clear that mario martínez still 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.340
 they do not have anything concrete to go out to 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.319
 foreign but in case it goes real 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.420
 Spain will no longer hire 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.709
 from san pedro sula for football in depth 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.709
