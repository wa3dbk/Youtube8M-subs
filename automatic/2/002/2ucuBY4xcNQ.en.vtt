reason<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.430> second<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.180> long<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.629> because

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
reason it's second so long it's because

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.490 
reason it's second so long it's because
i<00:00:43.110> didn't<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.710> golden<00:00:44.250> pipes<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
i didn't use golden pipes so it's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.819

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.819 
traveling by cobblestone pop only so
that's<00:00:50.039> why<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.309> taking<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.149> longer<00:00:51.829> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that's why it's taking a bit longer to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
cobblestone will go in the upside in

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.100 
cobblestone will go in the upside in
this<00:02:28.700> furnace<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:31.160> call<00:02:31.570> will<00:02:32.570> then<00:02:32.780> travel

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
this furnace the call will then travel

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.729 
this furnace the call will then travel
through<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:34.340> diamond<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.480> had<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.590> make

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
through this diamond but I had to make

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.850 
through this diamond but I had to make
it<00:02:36.799> like<00:02:37.100> this<00:02:37.820> way<00:02:38.540> could<00:02:39.110> accuse<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.620> thing

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
it like this way could accuse this thing

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.050 
it like this way could accuse this thing
parts<00:02:40.190> as<00:02:40.400> well<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.239> use<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:42.650> so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
parts as well but I use it like this so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.350 
parts as well but I use it like this so
that<00:02:44.060> nothing<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:45.049> actually<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:45.830> through<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
that nothing can actually go through to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
that nothing can actually go through to
the<00:02:47.570> side<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.110> i<00:02:48.170> put<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> random<00:02:48.920> object<00:02:49.070> like

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the side so i put a random object like

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.750 
the side so i put a random object like
stone<00:02:50.030> stairs<00:02:50.650> over<00:02:51.650> there<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:52.070> go<00:02:52.280> into<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
stone stairs over there to go into the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.820 
stone stairs over there to go into the
furnace<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.480> nothing<00:02:54.080> will<00:02:54.200> actually<00:02:54.620> go

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
furnace so that nothing will actually go

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.970 
furnace so that nothing will actually go
there<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.700> coal<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.560> travels<00:03:00.560> through

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there so the coal just travels through

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.020 
there so the coal just travels through
to<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.030> black

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
to the black

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.250 
to the black
and<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.780> bring<00:03:04.020> these<00:03:04.500> pipes<00:03:04.920> down<00:03:05.280> their

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and to bring these pipes down their

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130 
and to bring these pipes down their
supply<00:03:07.260> both<00:03:07.590> furnaces<00:03:08.340> with<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> call<00:03:09.180> it

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
supply both furnaces with the call it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.010 
supply both furnaces with the call it
goes<00:03:10.470> down<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.310> bottom<00:03:15.980> okay<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.040> now<00:03:18.020> your

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
goes down to bottom okay so now your

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.580 
goes down to bottom okay so now your
fairness<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.010> done<00:03:20.190> its<00:03:20.370> job<00:03:20.870> I've<00:03:21.870> used<00:03:22.319> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
fairness is done its job I've used a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.370 
fairness is done its job I've used a
wooden<00:03:22.950> pipe<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.640> subtract<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.630> items<00:03:25.110> I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
wooden pipe to subtract the items I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.920 
wooden pipe to subtract the items I
still<00:03:26.220> need<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.819> fix<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:28.250> yeah<00:03:29.690> into<00:03:30.690> putting

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
still need to fix this yeah into putting

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.820 
still need to fix this yeah into putting
iron<00:03:31.680> pipe<00:03:32.220> over<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.290> items

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
iron pipe over here so that the items

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.390 
iron pipe over here so that the items
don't<00:03:35.070> roll<00:03:35.310> around<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:37.040> am<00:03:38.040> i'm<00:03:38.190> going

to show you how I do that now but the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.120 
to show you how I do that now but the
Redstone<00:03:41.310> engines<00:03:42.290> follow<00:03:43.290> these<00:03:43.680> to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
Redstone engines follow these to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.479 
Redstone engines follow these to
subtract<00:03:45.030> them<00:03:45.239> from<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.510> furnaces<00:03:46.489> which

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
subtract them from the furnaces which

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.059 
subtract them from the furnaces which
they<00:03:47.730> go<00:03:47.910> through<00:03:47.940> these<00:03:48.600> pipes<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.890> that

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
they go through these pipes up to that

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.120 
they go through these pipes up to that
chest<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.819> my<00:03:51.030> room<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.530> I'm<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.860> going<00:03:53.069> to

show you how I put in and operate with
the<00:03:56.580> iron<00:03:56.910> pipe<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.650> fetched<00:03:59.190> my<00:03:59.400> iron<00:03:59.670> pipe

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
the iron pipe so I fetched my iron pipe

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.350 
the iron pipe so I fetched my iron pipe
transferred<00:04:00.930> by<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:02.610> will<00:04:02.760> also<00:04:02.970> need<00:04:03.300> a

transferred by and you will also need a
wrench<00:04:03.720> through<00:04:04.170> operating<00:04:05.060> I'm<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.300> going

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
wrench through operating I'm just going

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.120 
wrench through operating I'm just going
to<00:04:06.569> wait<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.750> anything<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.739> gone<00:04:09.829> quick<00:04:10.829> fix

means it will go yes there you go so

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.980 
means it will go yes there you go so
this<00:04:22.049> items<00:04:22.890> will<00:04:23.310> only<00:04:23.610> come<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.270> there<00:04:24.600> and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
this items will only come in there and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.820 
this items will only come in there and
conquer<00:04:25.890> then<00:04:26.130> muster<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:28.380> let's<00:04:28.530> just

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
conquer then muster up so let's just

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.360 
conquer then muster up so let's just
face<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.160> from<00:04:29.550> both<00:04:29.729> sides

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.600 

and<00:04:34.760> there<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.300> see<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.660> works<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.740> items<00:04:37.190> are

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and there you see it works the items are

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.219 
and there you see it works the items are
not<00:04:38.180> supposed<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.810> go<00:04:39.050> around<00:04:39.380> like<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:39.919> and

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229
