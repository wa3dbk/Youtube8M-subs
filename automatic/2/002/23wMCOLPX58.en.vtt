00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.049

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.040
Want an easy way to strengthen up mitered corners on picture frames and boxes?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.900
Check it!

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.790
This is the second video in a multi-part series on picture frame making.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.010
You can find the other videos in the links down below. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.450
This here is a real simple and easy to make jig that rides along your table saw fence 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.030
and allows you to cut splines in picture frames.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.120
Just using glue on mitered corners 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.520
may seem good enough but over time as the width of the wood expands and contracts with the seasons 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.110
the joints will eventually break. And that’s why you need splines.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
Unlike a lot of spline jigs this rides along the fence 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.910
and not in the miter slot which means you can place the spline anywhere you want 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.830
and even cut wider splines by moving the fence and making multiple passes.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.920
Setting the blade height is easy since the corner sits just a hair above the table 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.650
and the two guides easily clear the blade. Let’s get started!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.580
I’ll measure the height of my fence and cut two pieces of baltic birch plywood 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.360
to that measurement.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.020
Then I’ll measure the width of the two pieces and the fence 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.810
and cut the top on the tablesaw.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.710
I’ll attach the top piece by lightly clamping the two side pieces to the fence

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.040
and then glue and screw it together.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.340
Making sure it slides nicely along the fence I then attach the support board to the assembly.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.119
You’ll also want to make sure it’s square to the table before gluing it up.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.890
You can use any material you like but here I’m using MDF 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.710
that will be used to hold the the picture frame in place.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.550
Although this step is not necessary 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.370
I’m cutting 45° miters on the ends as you’ll see why shortly.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.580
I’ll then clamp down a drafting triangle to the support board 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.860
and use a speed square to make sure it’s at 45°.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.740
The drafting triangle is then used as a
guide for the two MDF pieces

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.780
The 45° angles we cut earlier align with the edges of the board. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.520
Again not necessary.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.800
After the MDF is clamped down I can then remove my drafting triangle 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.820
and once everything dries we’re all set to cut some splines.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.200
Setting the blade height is just a matter of setting the picture frame in the jig and raising the blade to the desired height.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.780
I then slide the fence over and visually align the blade to the center of the frame.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.369
I suggest clamping the frame to the jig as you run it over the blade.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.780
I like to shut the saw off between every cut just to be safe as I don’t like handling material over a spinning blade.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.980
Over on the bandsaw I’ll then cut out the spines and glue them in place. 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.880
A nice fit and doesn’t need to be too snug. 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.120
No clamps necessary.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.140
And when they dry I just sand them down flush.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.140
You can also use this gig to cut spline keys for boxes using the same steps.

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.689
I suggest using a full kerf blade with a flat grind.

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:35.609
A thin kerf blade will work just fine and if your blade doesn’t leave a flat bottom cut, don’t worry about it too much.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.560
The tiny little gap that it may leave may not even be noticeable and it could always be filled in with sawdust and glue.

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.669
Well thanks for watching! This is a multi-part series in picture frame making and I encourage you to check out these other links.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.110
Well that’s it! Be safe, stay passionate and make something!
