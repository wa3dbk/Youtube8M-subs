00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
mind that this is solo but you can do it

the key cards and get access to before
or<00:01:11.310> whatever<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> first<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
or whatever the first thing that I do is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460 
or whatever the first thing that I do is
I<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> em1<00:01:14.820> gun<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> use<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I get the em1 gun and then I use it on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.940 
I get the em1 gun and then I use it on
the<00:01:17.150> 3d<00:01:18.150> printer<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.680> my

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the 3d printer because yeah in my

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.469 
the 3d printer because yeah in my
opinion<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> easier<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
opinion this is the easier or not the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
opinion this is the easier or not the
easiest<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> most<00:01:22.140> difficult<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> attain

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
easiest but the most difficult to attain

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
easiest but the most difficult to attain
because<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.909> based<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> lock<00:01:24.600> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because it's all based on lock on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
because it's all based on lock on
getting<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> em1<00:01:25.350> gun<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.009> you're<00:01:26.130> good

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
getting the em1 gun but if you're good

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
getting the em1 gun but if you're good
at<00:01:26.369> getting<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> 3<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> 3d

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
at getting what you want to 3 the 3d

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.450 
at getting what you want to 3 the 3d
printer<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> could<00:01:28.740> hold<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
printer you could hold off and do this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
printer you could hold off and do this
one<00:01:29.610> later<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.299> all<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.689> do<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.079> get

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
one later but all you're gonna do is get

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
one later but all you're gonna do is get
the<00:01:31.710> em1<00:01:31.979> gun<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:33.060> shoot<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.200> hit

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the em1 gun and then shoot it as you hit

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
the em1 gun and then shoot it as you hit
the<00:01:34.920> Machine<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> you'll<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.299> little<00:01:36.420> bit

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the Machine and you'll get a little bit

camouflage if you can save that for this
round<00:02:35.550> because<00:02:35.700> it's<00:02:35.970> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.270> pretty

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
round because it's going to be pretty

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.570 
round because it's going to be pretty
crucial<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.560> staying<00:02:37.920> alive<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.340> making

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
crucial to just staying alive and making

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.920 
crucial to just staying alive and making
it<00:02:38.670> easy<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.000> yourself<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.510> making<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.780> so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
it easy on yourself and making it so

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.080 
it easy on yourself and making it so
it's<00:02:40.080> pretty<00:02:40.200> much<00:02:40.380> impossible<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:41.130> fail<00:02:41.340> once

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it's pretty much impossible to fail once

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.850 
it's pretty much impossible to fail once
you<00:02:42.210> have<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.420> you're<00:02:43.350> gonna<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.770> go

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you have that you're gonna want to go

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.890 
you have that you're gonna want to go
ahead<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.790> infected<00:02:45.210> on<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> infected

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
ahead and get infected on the infected

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
ahead and get infected on the infected
round<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.590> once<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.340> hit<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> infected

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
round so once you hit on the infected

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.690 
round so once you hit on the infected
round<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.710> host<00:02:49.890> round<00:02:50.250> people<00:02:50.610> are
