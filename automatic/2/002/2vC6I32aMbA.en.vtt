how much of this you'll get out of that
but<00:02:11.879> I'm<00:02:12.150> hoping<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.629> since<00:02:13.050> I've

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
but I'm hoping that since I've

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
but I'm hoping that since I've
we<00:02:13.549> used<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.329> maybe<00:02:14.750> four<00:02:15.110> or<00:02:15.140> five<00:02:15.230> times

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
we used it like maybe four or five times

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.589 
we used it like maybe four or five times
and<00:02:15.799> I've<00:02:15.920> owned<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.519> like<00:02:16.700> three<00:02:17.480> weeks

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
and I've owned this for like three weeks

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.720 
and I've owned this for like three weeks
now<00:02:17.750> I'm<00:02:18.349> hoping<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.860> it'll<00:02:19.069> last<00:02:19.310> me<00:02:19.459> for

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
now I'm hoping that it'll last me for

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
now I'm hoping that it'll last me for
quite<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:19.939> while

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
quite a while

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.550 
quite a while
necessity<00:02:21.610> yes<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.879> no<00:02:23.060> yes<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:23.989> it's<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.439> your

budget<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.260> totally<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:27.980> would<00:02:28.280> probably<00:02:28.430> just

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
budget I totally I would probably just

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.000 
budget I totally I would probably just
try<00:02:28.970> once<00:02:29.269> but<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:30.170> not<00:02:30.319> something<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
try once but it's not something that I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.220 
try once but it's not something that I
would<00:02:31.189> buy<00:02:31.909> continuously<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.989> it's<00:02:33.140> not

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
would buy continuously like it's not

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.599 
would buy continuously like it's not
something<00:02:33.409> that<00:02:33.680> if<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.859> ran<00:02:34.069> out<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.250> would<00:02:34.519> have

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
something that if I ran out I would have

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.940 
something that if I ran out I would have
run<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.939> store<00:02:35.659> and<00:02:35.720> buy<00:02:35.959> more<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.829> just

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
run to the store and buy more it's just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.289 
run to the store and buy more it's just
not<00:02:37.159> one<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> those<00:02:37.459> products<00:02:37.879> for<00:02:37.909> me<00:02:38.090> simply

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
not one of those products for me simply

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.089 
not one of those products for me simply
because<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:38.959> make<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.439> professionally<00:02:40.010> and

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
skin women which i think is a no-go and

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.080 
skin women which i think is a no-go and
you<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:21.799> obviously<00:04:22.310> that's<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.760> first

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
you know obviously that's the first

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.250 
you know obviously that's the first
thing<00:04:23.300> I'm<00:04:23.450> going<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.719> think<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.020> is

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
thing I'm going to think of is

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.990 
thing I'm going to think of is
can<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.440> use<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:24.860> my<00:04:25.010> kit<00:04:25.220> no<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.640> can't

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
can I use this in my kit no I can't

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.280 
can I use this in my kit no I can't
because<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.480> shade<00:04:26.690> range<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.050> not<00:04:27.170> the

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
because the shade range is not the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.190 
because the shade range is not the
greatest<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.220> I'd<00:04:28.850> still<00:04:29.150> use<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.600> great

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
greatest so I'd still use it great

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.460 
greatest so I'd still use it great

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
product on that brush so I mean it

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.020 
product on that brush so I mean it
really<00:06:24.440> really<00:06:24.650> darkens<00:06:25.340> those<00:06:25.490> lashes<00:06:25.670> and<00:06:26.000> I

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
really really darkens those lashes and I

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.700 
really really darkens those lashes and I
just<00:06:26.270> find<00:06:26.450> that<00:06:26.510> lash<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.990> little<00:06:27.290> what<00:06:27.620> I've

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
just find that lash to little what I've

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.559 
just find that lash to little what I've
been<00:06:27.800> using<00:06:27.980> before<00:06:28.550> on<00:06:29.270> its<00:06:29.480> own<00:06:29.660> its

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
been using before on its own its

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.659 
been using before on its own its
it<00:06:30.899> separates<00:06:31.409> too<00:06:31.649> much<00:06:31.830> so<00:06:32.219> if<00:06:32.369> I<00:06:32.490> can<00:06:32.639> just

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
it separates too much so if I can just

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.820 
it separates too much so if I can just
get<00:06:32.879> a<00:06:32.939> mascara<00:06:33.360> that<00:06:33.509> does<00:06:33.719> these<00:06:33.960> two<00:06:34.379> things

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
get a mascara that does these two things

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.689 
get a mascara that does these two things
at<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.009> same<00:06:35.189> time

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
at the same time

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.029 
at the same time
that<00:06:36.059> would<00:06:36.179> be<00:06:36.330> phenomenal<00:06:36.719> but<00:06:37.499> until<00:06:37.860> now<00:06:38.009> I

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
that would be phenomenal but until now I

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.799 
that would be phenomenal but until now I
will<00:06:38.399> settle<00:06:38.639> for<00:06:38.849> just<00:06:39.029> this<00:06:39.179> one<00:06:39.240> or<00:06:39.569> just
