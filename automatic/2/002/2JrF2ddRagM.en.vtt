00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.619
 hi friends with you doc ​​brown and today 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.109
 I will tell you about myself 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.810
 is a game on suv xl 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.250
 so sit back and we 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.250
 we will begin 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
 and so what is this game interesting what 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 many players call and you deal 23 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 what was she supposed to be why 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.070
 You ask, and all because an act 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.860
 souls keeps that gloomy and in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.559
 carrier atmosphere that has been lost 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.110
 In diablo 3, moreover, the game absorbed in 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 yourself many features of diablo 2 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 and all who played the classic old 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 good deawoo right away it'll slip through 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 however despite this call the game 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.770
 pendant can not be so passes from the file there 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 sickly difference and I would say 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.180
 just unique features but about 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.009
 this a little later 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.130
 by suffix at the moment 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.220
 there are 6 classes of Walther that is 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.940
 classic warrior ranger that is apprentice 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.090
 the witch is clear that the poppy duelist is 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.640
 something between power and agility 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.830
 the average between the power of magic gel 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.050
 the average between the knack of peremoga it 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 generally more something resembling a 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.759
 assassin despite the fact that the whole game is on 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.220
 English she is quite a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.080
 intuitive that as a matter of fact 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.150
 interface resembles diablo 2 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.420
 so no one should have 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 problems with mastering the world of the game what 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.159
 concerns graphics and character animation 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.439
 everything here is very high 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.110
 looks very decent bosses 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.509
 really dumb from the creepy 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.149
 dungeons sometimes already goosebumps 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.490
 so the overall impression is made up 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.009
 very nice first thing you want 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.590
 pay attention to the fact that by suv xl 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.049
 this multiplayer game 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.900
 however this does not mean huge queues 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.959
 dungeons and around the manual absolutely no 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.940
 yes and you where there is a chat and I play 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 a huge number of players however 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.540
 other people you'll basically be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 meet in the cities 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 so on locations you don't have to 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.549
 shouted a race to another player 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 melts away I knocked out but at the same time you 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.780
 can invite someone to the group and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.120
 exterminate various evil spirits together 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.980
 which actively complements the local land 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.569
 as everything else is worth noting that 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.900
 the game is distributed by model 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.290
 free-to-play so you don't have to 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.510
 buy one of the most important 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.579
 The feature is that in principle in the game 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 no currency 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.510
 well , at least in our usual 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.909
 understanding it can actually be said that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.400
 merchants in the game exchange with the players 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.650
 items that is for example currency 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.109
 can serve as a stone gain armor 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.480
 well, or a teleportation scroll and then such 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.340
 Here's a move many seem strange 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.919
 but in fact it is not so some 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.579
 problems of connection with this in the game is absolutely not 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.040
 arises 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.230
 I would even say that it’s nice. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 that we do not have to constantly worry 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.669
 parsing words to run up trades to 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.829
 hurry to sell the fact that we derive 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.859
 by the way is worth a reference the coolest gear 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.579
 we naturally do not buy and drink 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.169
 monsters and bosses themselves of course 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.109
 the next unique feature is 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.530
 tree passive skill you yourself 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:42.299
 skill players themselves believe such 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.579
 tree of skills you just have not seen anywhere 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.010
 all this tree is just like 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.110
 huge starry sky and i don't even 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.880
 imagine how long it would take 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.340
 you spend on studying all 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.730
 being in it skills moreover 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.550
 whatever class you choose you can 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.890
 learn any skills in this tree 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.320
 no one limits you however nevertheless 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.050
 should take into account the features of the selected 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.680
 you class so you do not accidentally turn 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.570
 your character is something absolutely 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.560
 unplayable studying by mistake is not something that 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.900
 you need 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.840
 As for active skills, well, or 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.670
 skills then everything is also very cool 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.669
 on the panel you can safely set 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.160
 at the same time I have house 8, however 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.530
 the salt is that your skills are represented 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.690
 in the game and such magic stones 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 which you insert into your gear 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.240
 these stones are divided into three types of red then 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.030
 there are stones of power green search agility 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.040
 and blue that is these intelligence stones 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.350
 stones you will get for doing 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.500
 quests you also knock out the monster 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.630
 cool for example that playing for a warrior you 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.970
 can put yourself skill on fire 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.160
 ball and thereby make yourself from such 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.650
 warrior manga so farther that is 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.830
 combinations can be a huge variety 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.710
 and it all depends solely on your 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.620
 preferences and your personal playing style 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.770
 as for equipment, then you also 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.080
 nobody in any way limit any 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.120
 the character can wear absolutely any 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.950
 armhole weapons but worth paying 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.419
 attention to the bonuses that you 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.650
 get when you wear this or that thing 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.540
 the only restriction is that you 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.090
 be able to wear and what is not is 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.850
 parameters of power and intelligence dexterity for 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.620
 solving different items required 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.540
 different number of these parameters however 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.340
 how in this was not raising your level 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.400
 You can enhance these features. 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.860
 wear previously inaccessible to you and 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.830
 things in the end I want to say that 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.100
 despite all the similarity of yabla this game 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.340
 in its own way 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.660
 Olya and deserves your attention 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.630
 looks really wonderful 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.220
 atmosphere and nice gameplay so on 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.020
 leisure 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.150
