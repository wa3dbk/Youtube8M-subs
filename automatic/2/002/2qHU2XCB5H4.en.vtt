 of the montreux jazz festival 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:24.160
 without shine but time in meeting and then 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.290
 I told one day about my team 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.449
 that constantly people abroad in 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.769
 France ask me for an album of it 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.309
 wanted to hear me sing old 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.780
 French songs and to laugh I have 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.370
 thought everything ignites and we said 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.080
 that in barbarians mixed with jazz and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 I 'm ok but then we're here to 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.860
 the coup is said to quincy jones to arrange 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 pieces because on the second 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.309
 album I had asked and then it's 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.559
 that's so close to that you do not care 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.120
 me what and then actually my editor has 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.739
 called him and tried immediately in 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.250
 did it all at this match and it was 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 super fast and that's it was 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 super fast 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.869
 how do we feel when we 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.850
 arrives in the studio and we end up 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.649
 still with legends 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.350
 kid actually besides me I did not have 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 slept the night so it adds to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 orange was completely smashed and he 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 ya john clayton who gets to the bottom there and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:31.740
 I see it and we look at each other in 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:34.440
 eyes and it's not bullshit as if 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.170
 we already knew each other and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.409
 bullshit what do you see from the laddh's 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.130
