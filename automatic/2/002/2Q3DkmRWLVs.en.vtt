 today is our turn the Christianity 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.960
 carries with it the brand of wanting to change 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.940
 the world like that began 21 centuries ago 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.820
 when Christ left that mark in about 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.860
 few to follow him was a very career 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.470
 risky a career that would go to 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.330
 all nations from jerusalem 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.369
 in the first century Christianity was 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.800
 space to new horizons and to 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.930
 first countries not only ventured to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.630
 leave but they also upset their 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.449
 environment began in jerusalem it 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.460
 extended to all Judea and Samaria and 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.649
 they began to spread throughout the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.780
 earth the world of then was a 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.539
 mixture of gods of Olympus and religions 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.389
 pagan the idea area of ​​a unique god and 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:46.510
 the one of christ a resurrected savior was 

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:50.049
 a complete madness however little to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.969
 little the world began to believe who 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.769
 they were the church the church was a 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.809
 weird group that met with love and 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.839
 joy around the gospels and 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.789
 christ shared the bread they sang psalms 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.739
 and they adored

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.910
 the doors open but in general the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.320
 authorities resisted and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.290
 they persecuted Christians 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.550
 until death being Christian was moved 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.520
 rather than worshiping the gods of 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.490
 empire however the torch of this 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.390
 message grew and strengthened during 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.720
