video later this week i'll show you how

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.760 
video later this week i'll show you how
to<00:00:15.120> use<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.390> same<00:00:15.630> technique<00:00:16.110> to<00:00:16.139> rescue<00:00:16.650> an

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
to use the same technique to rescue an

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.830 
to use the same technique to rescue an
image<00:00:17.040> that's<00:00:17.279> too<00:00:17.580> bright<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:18.000> overexposed

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
image that's too bright are overexposed

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.090 
image that's too bright are overexposed
so<00:00:19.590> we'll<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.830> started<00:00:20.099> so<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.000> our

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
so we'll get started so here is our

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
so we'll get started so here is our

shade of black gray and white are

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
shade of black gray and white are
present<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> image<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.579> begin<00:00:39.000> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
present in the image so begin this

present in the image so begin this
underexposed<00:00:40.110> image<00:00:40.110> you'll<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
underexposed image you'll see that the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.910 
underexposed image you'll see that the
graph<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.489> heavily<00:00:41.880> skewed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> left

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
graph is heavily skewed to the left

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
graph is heavily skewed to the left
however<00:00:43.920> since<00:00:44.340> under<00:00:44.940> exposure<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.600> also

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
however since under exposure can also

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.319 
however since under exposure can also
affect<00:00:46.320> contrast<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.880> any<00:00:48.030> true

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
affect contrast we don't have any true

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
affect contrast we don't have any true
blacks<00:00:48.630> in<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> image<00:00:49.290> either<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.250> can

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
blacks in this image either as you can

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850 
blacks in this image either as you can
see<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.270> generally<00:00:52.140> speaking<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
see right here generally speaking you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
see right here generally speaking you
know<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:54.030> an<00:00:54.180> image<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.690> properly<00:00:55.140> exposed

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know when an image is properly exposed

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
know when an image is properly exposed
when<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> true<00:00:56.820> black<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.450> true<00:00:58.140> white

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
when there's a true black a true white

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
when there's a true black a true white
and<00:00:58.710> an<00:00:58.920> appropriate<00:00:59.520> mix<00:00:59.700> of<00:00:59.910> Gray's<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and an appropriate mix of Gray's so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
and an appropriate mix of Gray's so
we're<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> move<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> far<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.940> arrow

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
we're going to move the far right arrow

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.410 
we're going to move the far right arrow
that<00:01:03.600> controls<00:01:04.470> our<00:01:04.649> lights<00:01:05.399> are<00:01:05.700> white<00:01:05.910> to

right hand side and in order to fix the
fact<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.399> don't<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.759> true<00:01:12.179> black<00:01:12.539> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
fact that we don't have a true black so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
fact that we don't have a true black so
the<00:01:13.229> true<00:01:13.380> blacks<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.100> here

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the true blacks would be in here

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
the true blacks would be in here
somewhere<00:01:14.940> we're<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> move<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.259> black

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
somewhere we're going to move the black

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
somewhere we're going to move the black
arrow<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> graph<00:01:18.060> starts<00:01:18.360> on

arrow to about where the graph starts on
that<00:01:19.649> side<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.250> fix<00:01:20.490> our<00:01:20.610> contrast<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.899> the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
one that is the most has the most to do

one that is the most has the most to do
with<00:01:24.750> personal<00:01:24.929> taste<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.709> this<00:01:26.310> gray<00:01:26.910> arrow

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

with personal taste is this gray arrow
inside<00:01:27.959> here<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.160> are<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.520> move

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
inside here and you are going to move

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.050 
inside here and you are going to move
that<00:01:30.060> until<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.990> feel<00:01:31.319> it<00:01:31.649> is<00:01:31.860> appropriate<00:01:32.190> um

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that until you feel it is appropriate um

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.930 
that until you feel it is appropriate um
and<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.349> something<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.880> sometimes<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
and that is something that sometimes you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.790 
and that is something that sometimes you
have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.959> push<00:01:37.319> it<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> one

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
have to like really push it to one

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.529 
have to like really push it to one
extreme<00:01:38.069> or<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> other<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.910> go<00:01:39.060> nope<00:01:39.300> that's

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
extreme or the other to go nope that's

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.600 
extreme or the other to go nope that's
not<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:39.959> so<00:01:40.709> you<00:01:40.800> just<00:01:40.890> find<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> spot<00:01:41.580> that
