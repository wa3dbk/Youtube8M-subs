00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.160
 I'm because I'm in a puddle of water 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 in the little water bag we have to 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.580
 concentrate on building a shelter 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.250
 to survive 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.519
 on the beach they are trapped but 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.510
 we are not because we are in 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.890
 a puddle of water 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:03.399

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.870
 Johnny is pretty obvious when you think 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.520
 logically like yao the brain 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.830
 Adam logical presents fred zombie 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.840

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.720
 I'm still uncles, I've found a new one 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.810
 way to use our pens 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.590
 feather hats 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.240
 so sexy someone wants to try my 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 donut 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.640
 and in the end nobody wanted to try 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.620
 your donut good as it goes let's go 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.130
 to start building our first 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.470
 Come on me, I do not want to break things 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.780
 and see what happens you want to build a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.070
 refuge but I want to break things 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.470
 better as your refuge, you would not like it 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.570
 eye I will continue with my roll and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.550
 break things without you and this stone goes to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.550
 be my first victim I will break 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.810
 it's very hard to break this there has to be 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.870
 a treasure inside there must be a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.239
 treasure inside we're going to give entrance a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.219
 time I come in but first I have 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.260
 to break this block with my hands on 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.500
 my only mission is life so now 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.599
 I'm going to do a manual work oo 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.480
 I forgive I do not defend sensual sense 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.459
 but in the sense of breaking blocks 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.459
 maybe in the sensual sense 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.870
 or I'm broken 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.340
 there is no treasure 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.340
 do not 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.690
 but what is this world is not anything 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.120
 that I have seen before we will not let 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.280
 this world breaks us we will break it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.280
 we block to block 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.920
 this is a tasty donut 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.340
 Of course it's a tasty donut and you 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:51.400
