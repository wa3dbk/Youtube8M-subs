00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
slightly maybe it's just angle but it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.060 
slightly maybe it's just angle but it
looked<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.269> was<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.420> little<00:03:22.600> bit<00:03:23.070> over

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070

under<00:03:24.430> rotated<00:03:24.880> compared<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> my<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.420> hand

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
under rotated compared to my right hand

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.110 
under rotated compared to my right hand

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
is a stiff leg deadlift but every time

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.080 
is a stiff leg deadlift but every time
I've<00:05:41.400> been<00:05:41.460> doing<00:05:41.789> my<00:05:42.300> stiff<00:05:43.229> leg<00:05:43.410> dead<00:05:43.620> lifts

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
I've been doing my stiff leg dead lifts

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
I've been doing my stiff leg dead lifts
I've<00:05:45.090> been<00:05:45.270> increasing<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.780> weigh<00:05:45.870> five

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
I've been increasing the weigh five

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.510 
I've been increasing the weigh five
pounds<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.590> I'll<00:05:46.680> probably<00:05:46.830> keep<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.190> up

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
pounds and I'll probably keep that up

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.500 
pounds and I'll probably keep that up
until<00:05:47.729> I<00:05:47.910> get<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.800> 275<00:05:49.800> pounds<00:05:50.310> in<00:05:51.060> which<00:05:51.300> I'll

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
until I get to 275 pounds in which I'll

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.140 
until I get to 275 pounds in which I'll
probably<00:05:51.780> hit<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.919> way<00:05:53.100> for<00:05:53.580> two<00:05:53.910> weeks

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
probably hit that way for two weeks

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.020 
probably hit that way for two weeks
before<00:05:54.330> raising<00:05:54.720> five<00:05:55.080> pounds<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:56.639> on<00:05:56.820> and

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
before raising five pounds and so on and

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.090 
before raising five pounds and so on and
keep<00:05:57.180> increasing<00:05:57.539> their<00:05:57.960> way<00:05:58.080> up<00:05:58.229> but<00:05:58.950> who

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
keep increasing their way up but who

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.469 
keep increasing their way up but who
knows<00:05:59.310> maybe<00:05:59.580> I'll<00:05:59.700> just<00:06:00.000> go<00:06:00.150> all<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.330> way<00:06:00.360> to

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
knows maybe I'll just go all the way to

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.500 
knows maybe I'll just go all the way to
315<00:06:01.139> before<00:06:02.000> slowing<00:06:03.000> down<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.360> progression

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
315 before slowing down the progression

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.170 
315 before slowing down the progression
so<00:06:04.500> far<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:05.070> movements<00:06:05.520> been<00:06:05.820> looking<00:06:06.090> better

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
so far the movements been looking better

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.430 
so far the movements been looking better
and<00:06:06.419> better<00:06:06.570> over<00:06:06.870> time<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.260> I've<00:06:07.320> been
