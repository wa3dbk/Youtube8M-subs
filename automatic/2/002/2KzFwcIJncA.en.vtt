which the biggest one being the gear
issues<00:03:19.410> are<00:03:19.590> extremely<00:03:20.010> sure<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.910> max<00:03:21.120> now

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
issues are extremely sure in max now

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.430 
issues are extremely sure in max now
around<00:03:21.739> 170<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.610> gear<00:03:24.480> ratios<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:24.959> actually

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
around 170 so gear ratios are actually

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.900 
around 170 so gear ratios are actually
really<00:03:25.709> really<00:03:26.100> quite<00:03:26.280> sure<00:03:26.520> you're<00:03:26.820> only

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
really really quite sure you're only

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.410 
really really quite sure you're only
getting<00:03:28.160> what<00:03:29.160> thirty<00:03:29.489> miles<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> first

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
getting what thirty miles now to first

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.750 
getting what thirty miles now to first
gear<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.870> very<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.530> short<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.400> once<00:03:32.640> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
gear it's very very short but once you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.580 
gear it's very very short but once you
get<00:03:32.880> used<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> gear<00:03:33.420> ratios<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.080> full

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
get used to the gear ratios that full

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.670 
get used to the gear ratios that full
drive<00:03:34.890> system<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:36.000> good<00:03:36.989> peppy<00:03:37.470> amount

drive system and that good peppy amount

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.220 
drive system and that good peppy amount
of<00:03:37.769> power<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:39.330> gives<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.810> good<00:03:39.959> load

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
of power really gives you good load

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.540 
of power really gives you good load

oh<00:03:41.670> god<00:03:41.970> i<00:03:42.000> can't<00:03:42.360> enlist<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.440> very<00:03:43.560> very

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
oh god i can't enlist a it's very very

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.960 
oh god i can't enlist a it's very very
fun<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.910> drive<00:03:45.030> i<00:03:45.360> mean<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:46.320> just<00:03:46.560> works<00:03:47.310> you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
fun to drive i mean it just works you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.699 
fun to drive i mean it just works you
can<00:03:48.150> put<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:48.570> places<00:03:48.780> where<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.140> can't

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
can put it in places where you can't

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.500 
can put it in places where you can't
really<00:03:50.160> put<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.940> more<00:03:51.330> powerful

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
really put some of the more powerful

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.979 
really put some of the more powerful
rear-wheel<00:03:52.080> drive<00:03:52.110> cars<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:54.000> because<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
rear-wheel drive cars just because it

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.890 
rear-wheel drive cars just because it
really<00:03:55.560> does<00:03:55.769> grip<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.310> really<00:03:57.180> handles<00:03:57.630> well

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
really does grip it really handles well

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.870 
really does grip it really handles well
it<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.800> you've<00:03:58.980> got<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.459> used<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
it just you've got to get used to the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.880 
it just you've got to get used to the
short<00:04:00.180> e<00:04:00.360> ratios<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.959> i'm<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.410> fourth<00:04:01.680> gear

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
short e ratios like i'm in fourth gear

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.350 
short e ratios like i'm in fourth gear
now<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.370> feels<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.000> should<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.269> in

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
now and it feels like I should be in

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.509 
now and it feels like I should be in
third<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.440> bit<00:04:04.980> odd

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
third it's a bit odd

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.259 
third it's a bit odd
it<00:04:05.850> really<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.540> especially<00:04:06.959> shifting<00:04:07.470> down

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
it really is especially shifting down

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.009 
it really is especially shifting down
didn't<00:04:09.269> expect<00:04:09.540> there<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.660> be<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> fire<00:04:09.989> truck

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
didn't expect there to be a fire truck

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.810 
didn't expect there to be a fire truck
they're<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.620> gonna<00:04:10.769> lie<00:04:10.950> stop<00:04:11.250> honking<00:04:11.489> your

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
they're not gonna lie stop honking your

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.280 
they're not gonna lie stop honking your
horn<00:04:11.850> man<00:04:12.209> grow<00:04:13.170> up<00:04:13.320> drive

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
horn man grow up drive

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.370 
horn man grow up drive
anyway<00:04:15.250> yeah<00:04:15.489> it's<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.479> bit<00:04:16.900> weird

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
anyway yeah it's it's a bit weird

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.509 
anyway yeah it's it's a bit weird
especially<00:04:17.680> when<00:04:18.010> you're<00:04:18.100> doing<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.310> hard

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
especially when you're doing a hard

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.099 
especially when you're doing a hard
launch<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:19.060> got<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.299> change<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.660> second

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
launch you got to change the second

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.439 
launch you got to change the second
almost<00:04:20.350> instantly<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.040> mean<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.699> can

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
almost instantly I mean I can I can

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.810 
almost instantly I mean I can I can
demonstrate<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.080> right<00:04:23.770> now<00:04:23.979> let's<00:04:24.699> head

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
demonstrate that right now let's head

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.460 
demonstrate that right now let's head
into<00:04:24.970> first<00:04:25.270> let's<00:04:25.750> give<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.050> bit<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.290> rev

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
into first let's give it a bit of a rev

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.379 
into first let's give it a bit of a rev
and<00:04:28.680> second<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:29.860> very<00:04:30.460> very<00:04:30.940> quick<00:04:31.210> in

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
and second it's very very quick in

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.370 
and second it's very very quick in
second<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.960> revs<00:04:32.400> extremely<00:04:33.400> quickly<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.840> I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
second it revs extremely quickly but I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.250 
second it revs extremely quickly but I
really<00:04:36.340> do<00:04:36.460> enjoy<00:04:36.490> driving<00:04:37.240> aids<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:37.690> reminds

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
really do enjoy driving aids in reminds

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.140 
really do enjoy driving aids in reminds
me<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.410> what<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> BRZ<00:04:38.919> was<00:04:39.400> like<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:39.940> know<00:04:40.030> I

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
me of what the BRZ was like and I know I

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.510 
me of what the BRZ was like and I know I
said<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.419> about<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.810> s4<00:04:41.289> but<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:42.400> even

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
said that about the s4 but this is even

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.909 
said that about the s4 but this is even
more<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:42.940> because<00:04:43.150> it's<00:04:43.539> full<00:04:43.750> Drive<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.440> it

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
more so because it's full Drive and it

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.560 
more so because it's full Drive and it
has<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.100> good<00:04:45.340> man<00:04:45.520> power<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.210> has<00:04:46.389> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
has a good man power and it has the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.750 
has a good man power and it has the
short<00:04:46.840> gear<00:04:47.050> ratios<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.740> really<00:04:48.460> does<00:04:48.639> allow

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
short gear ratios it really does allow

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.270 
short gear ratios it really does allow
me<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.090> be<00:04:49.270> Ozzy<00:04:49.389> back<00:04:50.320> when<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.740> had<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.070> wrong

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
me to be Ozzy back when it had the wrong

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.730 
me to be Ozzy back when it had the wrong
physics<00:04:51.970> which<00:04:52.539> I<00:04:52.750> really<00:04:53.350> loved

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
physics which I really loved

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.219 
physics which I really loved
if<00:04:53.860> those<00:04:54.430> if<00:04:54.610> you<00:04:54.820> do<00:04:54.970> don't<00:04:55.270> know<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.690> love<00:04:56.050> to

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
if those if you do don't know I love to

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.990 
if those if you do don't know I love to
be<00:04:56.350> out<00:04:56.470> here<00:04:56.500> with<00:04:56.740> those<00:04:56.889> physics<00:04:57.250> now<00:04:57.820> have

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
be out here with those physics now have

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.879 
be out here with those physics now have
a<00:04:58.030> lamppost<00:04:58.419> in<00:04:58.510> my<00:04:58.630> bonnet<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.020> always

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
a lamppost in my bonnet that always

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.469 
a lamppost in my bonnet that always
happens<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.400> game<00:05:00.610> that's<00:05:00.789> not<00:05:01.000> fun<00:05:01.270> with

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
happens in this game that's not fun with

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.070 
happens in this game that's not fun with
the<00:05:01.570> car<00:05:01.780> at<00:05:01.900> all<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.639> just<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:04.210> thoroughly

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080

genuinely genuinely very very enjoyable
especially<00:05:10.710> just<00:05:11.710> bits<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:12.039> road-holding<00:05:12.490> and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
especially just bits of road-holding and

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.909 
especially just bits of road-holding and
the<00:05:13.090> quick<00:05:13.600> acceleration<00:05:14.260> due<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.650> short

I<00:05:15.840> do<00:05:16.840> think<00:05:17.199> you<00:05:17.350> do<00:05:17.620> lose<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.889> bit<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.220> time

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
I do think you do lose a bit of time

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.050 
I do think you do lose a bit of time
shifting<00:05:19.000> gear<00:05:19.180> every<00:05:19.389> three<00:05:19.630> seconds<00:05:20.080> but

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
shifting gear every three seconds but

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.550 
shifting gear every three seconds but
who<00:05:22.060> can<00:05:22.270> complain<00:05:22.599> it's<00:05:22.900> very<00:05:23.199> very

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
who can complain it's very very

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.279 
who can complain it's very very
enjoyable<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:24.389> think<00:05:25.389> though<00:05:25.660> that's<00:05:26.050> all<00:05:26.229> I

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
enjoyable I think though that's all I

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.379 
enjoyable I think though that's all I
have<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.800> say<00:05:26.830> about<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.580> car<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:27.880> mean<00:05:28.150> it's

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389

no<00:05:28.539> real<00:05:28.780> problems<00:05:29.349> about<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.889> sound<00:05:30.190> file

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
no real problems about it the sound file

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.120 
no real problems about it the sound file
could<00:05:30.970> do<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> bit<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.840> work<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.710> just<00:05:32.919> sounds

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
could do a bit of work it just sounds

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.480 
could do a bit of work it just sounds
like<00:05:33.190> turbo<00:05:33.610> noise<00:05:33.820> right<00:05:34.060> now<00:05:34.199> but<00:05:35.199> I<00:05:35.490> wasn't

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
like turbo noise right now but I wasn't

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.000 
like turbo noise right now but I wasn't
that<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.940> model<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.389> very<00:05:37.690> very<00:05:37.990> nice<00:05:38.199> some<00:05:38.889> of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
that the model is very very nice some of

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.890 
that the model is very very nice some of
the<00:05:39.130> lights<00:05:39.430> like<00:05:39.669> look<00:05:39.820> at<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.000> back<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:40.660> seem

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
the lights like look at the back do seem

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.170 
the lights like look at the back do seem
a<00:05:40.990> bit<00:05:41.199> floaty<00:05:41.919> like<00:05:42.370> look<00:05:42.639> at<00:05:42.729> this<00:05:42.849> reverse

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
a bit floaty like look at this reverse

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.700 
a bit floaty like look at this reverse
well<00:05:43.419> it's<00:05:43.570> sort<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.900> floating<00:05:44.320> above<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
well it's sort of floating above the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.620 
well it's sort of floating above the
model<00:05:45.070> but<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.460> think<00:05:45.910> that's<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.090> TD<00:05:46.360> YouTube

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
model but I think that's a TD YouTube

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.000 
model but I think that's a TD YouTube
problem<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.229> not<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.349> problem<00:05:47.560> with<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> car

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
problem and not a problem with the car

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.219
