00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
if a trap doors over but it's a lot

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
if a trap doors over but it's a lot
easier<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.570> having<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:58.079> huge<00:01:58.409> chandeliers

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
easier than having like huge chandeliers

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.899 
easier than having like huge chandeliers
like<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> like<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.479> quite<00:02:01.049> low<00:02:01.259> roof<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.250> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
like that like on quite low roof so it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.389 
like that like on quite low roof so it's
still<00:02:03.119> light<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.659> area<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
still light up the area and I think it's

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639 
still light up the area and I think it's
quite<00:02:05.700> gooks<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.240> hidden<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.200> kind<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> did

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
quite gooks it's hidden so I kind of did

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.080 
quite gooks it's hidden so I kind of did
the<00:02:07.740> same<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.250> site<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.580> well<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090

hog with the rings on it this is like

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.979 
hog with the rings on it this is like
the<00:02:31.840> gauge<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.549> switch<00:02:33.549> on<00:02:33.790> or<00:02:33.970> off<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.299> lot<00:02:34.959> of

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
the gauge to switch on or off a lot of

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.630 
the gauge to switch on or off a lot of
Lang<00:02:35.200> system<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.829> was<00:02:35.920> quite<00:02:36.040> dark<00:02:36.340> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
Lang system because it was quite dark a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.530 
Lang system because it was quite dark a
little<00:02:37.030> chopping<00:02:37.659> kind<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> table<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
little chopping kind of table and so

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.339 
little chopping kind of table and so
this<00:02:40.689> is<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> pool<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:42.060> too<00:02:43.060> deep<00:02:43.269> with<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.870> step

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
this is a pool as too deep with a step

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.660 
this is a pool as too deep with a step
down<00:02:44.700> there<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.109> I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.370> pretty

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
down there and I think that's pretty

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.699 
down there and I think that's pretty
much<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:48.940> ground<00:02:49.359> floor<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.409> if<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.560> go

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
much the ground floor so if you go

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.690 
much the ground floor so if you go

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
upstairs this is the bedroom there's an

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.589 
upstairs this is the bedroom there's an
outside<00:02:55.659> kind<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.230> area<00:02:56.530> here<00:02:56.920> with<00:02:57.700> seating

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
outside kind of area here with seating

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.929 
outside kind of area here with seating
and<00:02:58.840> chairs<00:02:59.439> and<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.769> so<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.069> can<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.430> look
