00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.850 
but it did come off just not in the way
that<00:01:59.490> other<00:01:59.790> mascaras<00:02:00.420> would<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that other mascaras would do like it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.490 
that other mascaras would do like it
would<00:02:02.040> create<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.880> dark<00:02:03.270> circles<00:02:04.259> under

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
would create like dark circles under

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.560 
would create like dark circles under
your<00:02:04.530> eyes<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.700> blackness<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
your eyes with the blackness of the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.150 
your eyes with the blackness of the
mascara<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.799> did<00:02:07.920> when<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
mascara but what this one did when I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
mascara but what this one did when I
went<00:02:08.340> swimming<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.479> came<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.720> in

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
went swimming it actually came off in

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.559 
went swimming it actually came off in
flakes<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> didn't<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.640> stain<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.270> face

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
flakes so it didn't like stain my face

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.350 
flakes so it didn't like stain my face
or<00:02:12.780> anything

or anything

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.300 
or anything
in<00:02:13.420> terms<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.960> giving<00:02:14.200> length<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.860> volume<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
in terms of giving length and volume the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.130 
in terms of giving length and volume the
mascara<00:02:15.760> didn't<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.480> much<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.720> my

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
mascara didn't really do much for my

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.070 
mascara didn't really do much for my
Asian<00:02:17.950> lashes<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.210> did<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.600> well<00:02:19.810> in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
Asian lashes but it did do well in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960 
Asian lashes but it did do well in

so you've seen me apply it you've heard
what<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.590> think<00:03:13.890> about<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.340> what<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.910> bottom

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
what I think about it what is the bottom

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.390 
what I think about it what is the bottom
line<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.050> mascara<00:03:16.560> worth<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.160> or

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
line here is this mascara worth it or

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.900 
line here is this mascara worth it or
not

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
not

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.990 
not
well<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:19.140> my<00:03:19.590> opinion<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.340> think<00:03:20.819> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
well in my opinion I don't think that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.780 
well in my opinion I don't think that
it's<00:03:21.150> worth<00:03:21.650> $15<00:03:22.650> at<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.340> are<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> lot<00:03:23.760> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it's worth $15 at all there are a lot of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.539 
it's worth $15 at all there are a lot of
Cheaper<00:03:24.480> drugstore<00:03:25.110> mascaras<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.040> will

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
Cheaper drugstore mascaras that will

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.210 
Cheaper drugstore mascaras that will
outperform<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.660> mascara<00:03:28.110> for<00:03:28.530> sure<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.040> if

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
outperform this mascara for sure but if

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.369 
outperform this mascara for sure but if
you're<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> really<00:03:29.819> huge<00:03:30.209> Mac<00:03:30.510> person<00:03:30.810> or

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
you're a really huge Mac person or

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.530 
you're a really huge Mac person or
you're<00:03:31.950> really<00:03:32.250> into<00:03:32.549> high-end<00:03:33.000> products

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
you're really into high-end products

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.270 
you're really into high-end products
then<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.110> definitely<00:03:34.709> worth<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.040> try

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
then this is definitely worth a try

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.839 
then this is definitely worth a try
because<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.540> $15<00:03:37.349> is<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.980> little<00:03:38.700> bit

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
because I think that $15 is a little bit

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.350 
because I think that $15 is a little bit
on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> lower<00:03:39.329> end<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.440> high-end<00:03:41.360> mascara

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
on the lower end of the high-end mascara

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.050 
on the lower end of the high-end mascara
price<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:43.380> mascara<00:03:43.860> isn't<00:03:44.310> horrible<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
price this mascara isn't horrible and it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.059 
price this mascara isn't horrible and it
isn't<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> best<00:03:45.690> either<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.590> isn't<00:03:46.739> worth

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
isn't the best either and it isn't worth

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.580 
isn't the best either and it isn't worth
shelling<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:47.880> 15<00:03:48.450> dollars<00:03:48.810> especially<00:03:49.140> if

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
shelling out 15 dollars especially if

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.289 
shelling out 15 dollars especially if
you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.069> there<00:03:50.280> are<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> lot<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.849> other

you know that there are a lot of other

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.360 
you know that there are a lot of other
more<00:03:52.019> affordable<00:03:52.590> products<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.220> will

more affordable products that will

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.910 
more affordable products that will
definitely<00:03:53.579> work<00:03:54.150> better<00:03:54.599> than<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.230> so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
definitely work better than this so
