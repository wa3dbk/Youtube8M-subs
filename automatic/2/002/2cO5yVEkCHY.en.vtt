00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the box for that and the reason I picked

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.269 
the box for that and the reason I picked
this<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.160> Heidi<00:00:27.060> jalapeno<00:00:27.750> 2007<00:00:28.740> had

this up is Heidi jalapeno 2007 had
mentioned<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:29.910> her<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.990> wasn't<00:00:31.579> Marc<00:00:32.579> Jacobs

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
mentioned in her what wasn't Marc Jacobs

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.560 
mentioned in her what wasn't Marc Jacobs
overview<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.380> she<00:00:35.190> thought<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
overview that she thought this was a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
overview that she thought this was a
decent<00:00:36.989> liner<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> key<00:00:38.489> things

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
decent liner but one of the key things

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.100 
decent liner but one of the key things
that<00:00:38.910> caught<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.210> attention<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> was

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that caught my attention about it was

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
that caught my attention about it was
the<00:00:40.260> fact<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.530> she<00:00:40.920> said<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.540> didn't

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the fact that she said this thing didn't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
the fact that she said this thing didn't
move<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> difficult

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
move and was actually kind of difficult

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
move and was actually kind of difficult
to<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.469> eye<00:00:46.710> makeup<00:00:46.980> remover<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to get off with eye makeup remover and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.860 
to get off with eye makeup remover and
things<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> she<00:00:48.450> said<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> very

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
things like that and she said it is very

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.920 
things like that and she said it is very
very<00:00:49.500> black<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.820> picked<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
very black so I picked it up and it is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.619 
very black so I picked it up and it is
your<00:00:52.260> typical<00:00:52.530> felt<00:00:53.190> tip<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.480> fill

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
your typical felt tip I think it's fill

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.060 
your typical felt tip I think it's fill
tip<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.320> brushes<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> it's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
tip some of these are brushes and it's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.170 
tip some of these are brushes and it's
really<00:00:56.430> hard<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> tell<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> difference

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
really hard to tell the difference

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
really hard to tell the difference
whether<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> brush<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.469> its<00:00:59.039> felt<00:00:59.280> tip<00:00:59.489> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
whether it's a brush or its felt tip so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
whether it's a brush or its felt tip so
it<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:01.020> pen<00:01:01.559> liner<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.979> very<00:01:04.979> very

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it is a pen liner and it is very very

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.899 
it is a pen liner and it is very very
dark<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.939> wet<00:01:06.479> looking<00:01:07.020> very<00:01:07.890> easy<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.580> apply

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
dark and wet looking very easy to apply

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.810 
dark and wet looking very easy to apply

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.050 
flaking like I got nothing wet my finger
let's<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.760> any<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.000> them<00:02:45.090> move<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.480> way<00:02:45.630> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
let's see if any of them move that way I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.210 
let's see if any of them move that way I
will<00:02:48.060> say<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.530> stayed<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> best

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
will say that that one stayed the best

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.470 
will say that that one stayed the best
it's<00:02:50.490> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> bottom<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:53.280> some<00:02:53.670> reason

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's at the bottom but for some reason

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.250 
it's at the bottom but for some reason
this<00:02:54.810> one<00:02:54.870> flakes<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.860> me<00:02:56.070> with<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.260> eyelash

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
this one flakes with me with a eyelash

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.890 
this one flakes with me with a eyelash
curler<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> really<00:02:59.880> bums<00:03:00.120> me<00:03:00.270> out

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
curler and that really bums me out

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.570 
curler and that really bums me out
because<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.380> wanted<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.860> love<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.400> because

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
because I wanted to love this because

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.340 
because I wanted to love this because
it's<00:03:03.240> difficult<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.720> take<00:03:03.900> off<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.170> an<00:03:04.290> eye

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
it's difficult to take off with an eye

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
it's difficult to take off with an eye
makeup<00:03:04.680> remover<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.130> there<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.370> has<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.700> be

makeup remover right there it has to be

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.840 
makeup remover right there it has to be
difficult<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.160> won't<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.550> come<00:03:08.670> off

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
difficult to like it won't just come off

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.940 
difficult to like it won't just come off
flaking<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.960> eyelash<00:03:10.320> curler<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:10.860> it
