00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
typically on a supercar like this you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.809 
typically on a supercar like this you
would<00:02:42.629> see<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.840> exhaust<00:02:43.349> pipes<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.890> true<00:02:44.519> Viper

would see to exhaust pipes in true Viper
fashion<00:02:45.420> that's<00:02:45.569> not<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> case<00:02:46.049> we<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
fashion that's not the case we have the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.319 
fashion that's not the case we have the
exhaust<00:02:47.280> coming<00:02:47.549> out<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> side<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> the

this<00:03:07.140> Dodge<00:03:07.379> Viper<00:03:07.680> ACR<00:03:08.329> will<00:03:09.329> create<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
this Dodge Viper ACR will create a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.369 
this Dodge Viper ACR will create a
thousand<00:03:10.500> pounds<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.160> downforce<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> true

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
thousand pounds of downforce so a true

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.339 
thousand pounds of downforce so a true
testament<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.250> fact<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.299> is

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
testament of the fact that it is

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.000 
testament of the fact that it is
certainly<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.590> race<00:03:16.950> car<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:19.500> vehicle<00:03:19.859> has

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
certainly a race car the vehicle has

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.319 
certainly a race car the vehicle has
been<00:03:20.040> inspected<00:03:20.340> by<00:03:20.849> our<00:03:20.970> ase-certified

been inspected by our ase-certified

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.050 
been inspected by our ase-certified
technicians<00:03:21.829> again<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:22.950> only<00:03:23.160> has<00:03:23.549> three

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
technicians again it only has three

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.780 
technicians again it only has three
thousand<00:03:24.510> miles<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.549> essentially<00:03:26.549> it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
thousand miles on it so essentially it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.390
