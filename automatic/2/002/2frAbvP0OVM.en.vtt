00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 more than two hundred workers 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.790
 paraded this morning down the road 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.840
 national 3 ligando vila do conde póvoa 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 from varzim 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.379
 dairy farmers in the region said 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.300
 living one of the worst moments of the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 sector and decided to give a cry of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
 revolt explains carlos neves da 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.419
 association of milk producers with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 This is Portugal, let's live a brief 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.640
 difficult moment of the profession of 8 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 we see a 25% drop in price since the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 beginning of last year 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 we all know that industries 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 they are having difficulty selling milk 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.220
 are only Portuguese products - and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.920
 not just the premiums to pay - poet was 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.640
 produced in excess and therefore is author 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.490
 of the population's works to inspire 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.680
 consumed housing and also 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.120
 increase their distribution if they do not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.920
 there is interest in selling 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.040
 people can not choose why it is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.740
 one is a wake- up call around our 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.199
 situation and one by the 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.570
 that it is the solution says 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.130
 that the 34-year-old source owns a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 ball farm in the area with 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.570
 170 animals that are going through a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.719
 unsustainable situation and that people will 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 many influences and sustainable is in this 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.920
 moment we are to receive the price 83 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.830
 years 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.759
 It is our personal training course on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.049
 we really can not 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 We do not want to cut back on food. 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.130
 animal study because the number is not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's fault 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 We expect the supporter to come 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.009
 to improve because I think I do not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 can continue as soon as it will lead to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 bankruptcy hearts fights 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 we created conditions because nothing comes 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 little time was proposed to us 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.390
 be more competitive in relation to other 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.580
 countries 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.229
 We've been exploring farms. 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.039
 Let's make a lot of investments. 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.250
 high 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.450
 the g6 is starting to get tricky to achieve 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 floor of the salso in the zone is already is house is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.369
 homeless house without farm 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.640
 I'm really element of the golden one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.610
 ready to ski it is a time thing you do not have there 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.680
 her being an animal gives 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 the more you have more damage then a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.269
 of the functions that are not counting is the fire 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.640
 of the animals eduardo soares of 33 years 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.170
 invested 600 thousand euros in the business and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.630
 see the light in the tunnel bottom we go without 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.720
 the weakest link in the chain and 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.400
 when the diners get very much the link 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.019
 weaker is always from Carlos 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.970
 snows warned of the quality of milk 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.799
 Portuguese and criticized the import 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.769
 dairy products from abroad 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.620
 eight nearest is cooler with 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.140
 recognized quality and we have a 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.799
 or of other lots of 200 million 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.720
 years 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.579
 this is not only haiti but we already 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560
 we will be being imported but both 8 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.380
 amapá some white marks but it is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.730
 size that said gorthi so we think 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.269
 that a 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.790
 the kilo see cheese and I need hits 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.540
 light we we increased 1% and the consumption of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.549
 3 national aumentávamos 10% of consumption 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.010
 haiti and what we are watching is 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.750
 much of the country's import was created from the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.330
 cheese that is then sliced ​​a lot 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.700
 import of cotton and the solution 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.200
 first and foremost the producers 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 who appealed to those responsible 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
 of the two draws marked by where 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.120
 they want to see the designation 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.019
 portugal I am very visible in 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.909
 packaging 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.340
 we defy the industry for example to 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.480
 vote the symbol portugal am I buy the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.049
 what is ours 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.410
 portugal left because pt is a brand of 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.510
 his brigade is often with Dina 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.599
 especially when it is not Portuguese 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.129
 is interesting and on the other hand is that 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.829
 refers only to the location and packaging 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.410
 even happens the case that someone can 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.359
 buy a bar that is different from the one in 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.420
 bauru in small packages and cuts the 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.660
 fab brand to make yes of the moment 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.000
 which is a national brand we try to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.660
 to pack white white imported and therefore 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.489
 it is indeed important to have a symbol 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.609
 that people can identify the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.410
 distance as 18 in the end this is a 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.060
 which completes the industry 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.650
 endose packing 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.079
 idling blocked the road 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.729
 3 for about two hours. 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.070
 during the journey the producers 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.060
 distributed a light of appeal to the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.060
 consumption of national products
