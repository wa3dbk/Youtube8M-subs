inspired by whatever goes on in the
runway<00:01:56.109> but<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.740> make<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.429> into<00:01:57.549> your<00:01:57.789> own

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
runway but then make it into your own

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.569 
runway but then make it into your own
thing<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.719> buy<00:01:58.840> cheaper<00:01:59.380> clothes<00:02:00.130> and
