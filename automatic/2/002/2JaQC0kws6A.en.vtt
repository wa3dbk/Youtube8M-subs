00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
tying him up as it grows up this stake
we'll<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.710> keep<00:01:47.009> securing<00:01:47.850> him<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.210> he

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we'll just keep securing him so that he

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
we'll just keep securing him so that he
doesn't<00:01:48.509> lay<00:01:48.869> his<00:01:49.350> Tomatoes<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
doesn't lay his Tomatoes actually on the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
doesn't lay his Tomatoes actually on the
ground<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> they'll<00:01:51.000> start<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
ground and they'll start to get a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.580 
ground and they'll start to get a
disease<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.619> rot<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.520> keep<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> soil<00:01:54.119> moist

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
disease and rot just keep the soil moist

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
disease and rot just keep the soil moist
just<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.189> don't<00:01:56.369> want<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.759> too<00:01:56.969> wet<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just you don't want it to be too wet you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.730 
just you don't want it to be too wet you
don't<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> dry<00:01:58.079> out<00:01:58.110> though<00:01:58.469> because

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
don't want it to dry out though because

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.260 
don't want it to dry out though because
then<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> end<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.250> other<00:01:59.579> problems<00:02:00.060> too

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
then you end up with other problems too

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
then you end up with other problems too
so<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.540> watch<00:02:01.409> your<00:02:01.649> soil<00:02:01.890> stick<00:02:02.159> your

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so just watch your soil stick your

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
so just watch your soil stick your
finger<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> feel<00:02:03.360> moisture<00:02:03.899> in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
finger in there if you feel moisture in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
finger in there if you feel moisture in
there<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.009> need<00:02:05.159> water<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there then you don't need water if it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249 
there then you don't need water if it
feels<00:02:05.909> dry<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.479> surface<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> need

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
feels dry on that surface then you need

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
feels dry on that surface then you need
to<00:02:07.350> give<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.619> water
