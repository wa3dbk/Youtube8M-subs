YouTube video after all there are

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.680 
YouTube video after all there are
several<00:00:51.580> different<00:00:52.000> standards<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.479> choose

several different standards to choose
from<00:00:52.960> we<00:00:53.799> have<00:00:53.920> just<00:00:54.159> seen<00:00:54.309> several<00:00:54.760> different

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
from we have just seen several different

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:56.609 
from we have just seen several different
versions<00:00:55.299> of<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.690> same<00:00:55.869> animation<00:00:56.290> at

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
versions of the same animation at

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.200 
versions of the same animation at
different<00:00:56.920> frame<00:00:57.159> rates<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.610> we<00:00:58.030> could

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
different frame rates and we could

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.880 
different frame rates and we could
potentially<00:00:58.780> slow<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.140> down<00:00:59.170> as<00:00:59.470> much<00:00:59.619> as<00:00:59.739> we

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
potentially slow it down as much as we

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.640 
potentially slow it down as much as we
like<00:01:00.040> so<00:01:00.820> what<00:01:00.970> I'm<00:01:01.059> really<00:01:01.330> asking<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:01.989> what

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
like so what I'm really asking is what

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.560 
like so what I'm really asking is what
is<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.920> upper<00:01:03.250> limit<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.970> YouTube<00:01:04.330> player

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
is the upper limit of the YouTube player

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.020 
is the upper limit of the YouTube player
frame<00:01:04.960> rate<00:01:05.280> given<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.460> I<00:01:06.490> couldn't<00:01:06.850> find

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
frame rate given that I couldn't find

many<00:01:07.210> reliable<00:01:07.750> answers<00:01:08.109> on<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.350> interwebs<00:01:08.979> I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
many reliable answers on the interwebs I

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.179 
many reliable answers on the interwebs I
decided<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:10.119> experiment<00:01:10.630> myself<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:11.200> created<00:01:12.039> a

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
decided to experiment myself I created a

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.859 
decided to experiment myself I created a
simple<00:01:12.399> video<00:01:12.670> consisting<00:01:13.359> of<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.509> two

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
simple video consisting of just two

with<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.450> yellow<00:01:16.570> sir<00:01:16.899> I<00:01:17.049> then<00:01:17.740> made<00:01:17.920> several

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
with the yellow sir I then made several

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.130 
with the yellow sir I then made several
copies<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.939> video<00:01:19.030> while<00:01:19.509> varying<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
copies of the video while varying the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.130

framerate<00:01:20.439> in<00:01:20.799> each<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.159> now<00:01:22.090> how<00:01:22.509> exactly<00:01:22.689> is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
framerate in each one now how exactly is

this<00:01:23.170> going<00:01:23.439> to<00:01:23.590> help<00:01:23.710> us<00:01:23.950> figure<00:01:24.159> out

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
this going to help us figure out

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.849 
this going to help us figure out
YouTube's<00:01:24.729> frame<00:01:25.060> rate<00:01:25.240> well<00:01:26.229> if<00:01:26.500> we

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
YouTube's why well because we should get

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.380 
YouTube's why well because we should get
a<00:01:50.140> still<00:01:50.469> image<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:50.950> course<00:01:51.100> each<00:01:51.880> YouTube

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
a still image of course each YouTube

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.179 
a still image of course each YouTube
frame<00:01:52.659> will<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:52.929> determined<00:01:53.469> from<00:01:53.590> equivalent

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
frame will be determined from equivalent

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.969 
frame will be determined from equivalent
pairs<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.670> actual<00:01:55.179> video<00:01:55.450> frames<00:01:55.840> looking<00:01:56.799> for

pairs of actual video frames looking for

pairs of actual video frames looking for
a<00:01:57.009> still<00:01:57.280> image<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.759> relatively<00:01:58.240> easy<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:59.049> this

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
a still image is relatively easy so this

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.889 
a still image is relatively easy so this
experiment<00:01:59.679> should<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.069> good<00:02:00.280> indicator

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
experiment should be a good indicator

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.090 
experiment should be a good indicator

throughout some parts of the videos but

throughout some parts of the videos but
we<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.530> say<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:29.860> confidence<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
we can say with confidence that for the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.790 
we can say with confidence that for the
most<00:02:31.420> part<00:02:31.630> at<00:02:31.720> least<00:02:31.840> there<00:02:32.380> were<00:02:32.560> three

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
most part at least there were three

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.949 
most part at least there were three
videos<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.250> displayed<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> single<00:02:34.420> image<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
videos that displayed a single image of

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.020 
videos that displayed a single image of
a<00:02:35.050> yellow<00:02:35.319> circle<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.280> means<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
a yellow circle this means that the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670 
a yellow circle this means that the
YouTube<00:02:37.330> player<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.780> displaying<00:02:38.170> exactly

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
YouTube player was displaying exactly

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680 
YouTube player was displaying exactly
half<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.100> all<00:02:39.190> frames<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.120> clips<00:02:40.420> each

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
half of all frames in these clips each

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170 
half of all frames in these clips each
second<00:02:41.140> therefore<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.610> conclude<00:02:42.790> with

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
second therefore we can conclude with

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.880 
second therefore we can conclude with
reasonable<00:02:43.690> confidence<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.709> of

reasonable confidence that as of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.520 
reasonable confidence that as of
December<00:02:45.280> 2013<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:46.750> YouTube<00:02:47.080> video<00:02:47.319> player

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
per second as with any experiment the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.490 
per second as with any experiment the
results<00:02:55.030> weren't<00:02:55.180> perfect<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.319> could

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
results weren't perfect but we could

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.960 
results weren't perfect but we could
infer<00:02:56.650> an<00:02:56.980> answer<00:02:57.340> based<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
infer an answer based on the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.660 
infer an answer based on the
experimental<00:02:58.660> outcome<00:02:59.580> experimentation<00:03:00.580> is

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
experimental outcome experimentation is

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.880 
experimental outcome experimentation is
fun
