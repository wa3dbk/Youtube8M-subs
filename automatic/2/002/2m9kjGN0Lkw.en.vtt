my face but it doesn't dry it out then I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.560 
my face but it doesn't dry it out then I
put<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.320> bioactive<00:01:59.070> solution<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
put the bioactive solution now this is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.109 
put the bioactive solution now this is
not<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:01.079> toner<00:02:01.439> most<00:02:02.310> owners<00:02:02.640> don't<00:02:02.790> really

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
not your toner most owners don't really

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.179 
not your toner most owners don't really
have<00:02:03.329> any<00:02:03.540> purpose<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> EPO<00:02:04.710> active

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
have any purpose but the EPO active

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.170 
have any purpose but the EPO active
solution

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
solution

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.590 
solution
actually<00:02:06.480> does<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.320> um<00:02:08.390> something<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.450> call

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
actually does have um something I call

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.920 
actually does have um something I call
it<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.229> basically<00:02:10.440> you're<00:02:10.860> able<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it in it and basically you're able to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.620 
it in it and basically you're able to
again<00:02:12.930> control<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.250> bacterial<00:02:14.970> level<00:02:15.480> on

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
again control the bacterial level on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.150 
again control the bacterial level on
your<00:02:15.930> skin<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.710> really<00:02:16.890> fantastic

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
then again in you know the whole idea of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.120 
then again in you know the whole idea of
controlling<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.690> bacteria<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.709> know<00:02:22.830> /
