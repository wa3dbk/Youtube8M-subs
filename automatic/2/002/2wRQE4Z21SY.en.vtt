00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.679
 so much fear and what more fun of fear 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.820
 also very much you have asked for but 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 before I could not be sitting in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.359
 my desk if not in my chair or be 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 sitting on the table in a whole semi 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 chair passing fear without knowing what 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 defensive character freddy could be me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.059
 and I want to know what character you could 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.219
 be you because you already know that you can 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 game and the truth that I have a lot 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.750
 I really enjoy this one because 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390

 I raised scared company for now 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.310
 what are you doing so you liked it is very 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.440
 often I think a little yes I 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 like to scare but we are very 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.479
 Frequently the sincere answers 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.209
 set without being set sincere 6 and whole 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.650
 it's worth a bit of going out for a walk 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.400
 frequently 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.720
 so to walk what has been thrown to the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.510
 street what all me world but what 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.890
 he walks not much so I would say that little 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.570
 also bit little by little yes because to see 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.640
 I go for a walk I do not know I go out 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 I was thinking about going by or going out to buy 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.650
 that one but what it is to walk what 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.320
 it's good so it 's something little what is your 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.870
 favorite color asks me well my color 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.510
 favorite there is this color is there 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.730
 that I like so much because and I do not know but 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.140
 I love this color that is coffee 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.900
 the coffee I love the golden coffee I do not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.380
 the all- red convention of the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.840
 blood 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.160
 That's why turn red without passion is not 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.390
 the color of blood I like red 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.500
 yellow good yellow striking 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.990
 but it's not quite that my 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.990
 favorite a purple question 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.819
 I really like the purple color they say 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.400
 that the purple color to the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.049
 psychiatrists to control the mind of 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.670
 the good people to control for 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.500
 treat it tell us that purple is very 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 therapeutic but I want something like that says 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.069
 so but just do not put it by 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.629
 that but just conceive that my color 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.659
 or not to me with the favorites is the purple 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.760
 so purple you like to sing me 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.310
 love I love singing not obviously 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.769
 I do not like to sing but the typical one 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.150
 you sing in the shower and you think there's 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.030
 someone has given us that feeling of 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.519
 be fighting I'm fighting and you think 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.109
 that is undermining someone out thing 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.970
 it takes me past me I'm not using it like that 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.519
 and I really believe that I do this with the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.329
 eyes if I take off the soap like that from the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.829
 eyes 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.810
 suddenly I think I'm going I have the 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.430
 feeling that there is in that design a 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.889
 animatronic or watching me the shower message 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.750
 I'm fighting until yesterday soma os 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.790
 you imagine but if you do not go to that feeling 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.379
 and you put me like to sing because I'm leaving 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.959
 directly good you will like it if by 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.610
 the shower you like to sing more or less if 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.160
 nothing if I like to sing a lot 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 yes yes even if I sing badly one thing is that 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.920
 my brother asked me if I sing 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.200
 well have you asked if I like to sing 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.880
 so I say yes I like to sing 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.770
 you're shy no no i'm not shy 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.290
 I think I'm too extroverted or 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.060
 be that not without nothing nothing 00 shyness not 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.670
 I know it, they have not presented it to me or 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.530
 I want to know I'm not shy at all 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.390
 nothing gives me the same as being in front of 20 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.209
 people that 3000 I am still the same 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.260

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.590
 time a little bit nothing he is shy nothing you 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.300
 like to hide you depend if you are 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.860
 pointing with a gun I would like 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.570
 hide me but if they are going to give me a 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.230
 I do not like to hide this gift 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.750
 question I like to hide you from that 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.370
 who when I like to hide does not 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.550
 I have asked, do you like to hide from 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.050
 something specific generic asks me 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.060
 like to hide from you like 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.380
 hide if your mother comes with 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.210
 the notes in my hand because it has 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.490
 suspended there if you like to hide 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.790
 but life comes to you they bought you a 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.330
 little game there you do not like to hide 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.080
 so you like to hide 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.419
 I do not like to hide or if a little 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.220
 depend guys I think I do not like 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.470
 I think the last question was going to come out 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.970
 that animatronic animatronic arrived 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.090
 animatronic but I say animatronic 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.039
 It would be in fight night and friends I do not know 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.490
 If I'm ready to click 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.490
 I will give him 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.620
 bonnie would be bonnie now guys that already 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.240
 I know what to think about says army as not 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.550
 I did nothing tells me anything what can 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.500
 put says scares very often 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.590
 that's true because at night 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.120
 We had some amazing tastes if 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.130
 could sleep with me you will check 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.390
 I'm up all night 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.710
 because we have a nightmare that the 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.110
 which did not cure me the next day I said 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.250
 50 things now I got up I do not remember 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.380
 and you see it scares me 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.830
 so he puts pony scares is very 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:50.220
 often it is true sweet bon and 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.690
 Now now here I know what character I am 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.370
 freddy defense I've done it so that 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.840
 if it scares me later when we play 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.130
 again think again because 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.510
 we have to resume the night to see if 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.520
 I spend the night one that fits me 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.570
 there I almost do not get almost get it anymore 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.460
 explained manabí given many tips 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.800
 about the game so if you would like 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.870
 eat I think I want to go back I'm bonnie 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.210
 so this is a trick this is a 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.640
 trick because when I see it, it gives me 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.890
 less afraid because I'm the one that when I see 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.180
 It scares good and nothing happens I will be more 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.290
 quiet when I play but there are still 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.710
 master I think they want to have 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.510
 animatronic that we can 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.650
 It is one of them that I am very afraid of 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.560
 girls I do not know why I'm so afraid 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.480
 so you guys summarizing I'm pretty that 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.710
 does not know what encourages all of you in 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.390
 the comments you can not leave in 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.250
 twitter the facebook where you want and 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.900

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.220
 heap from here taking a fort 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.450
