00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.790
 the planet now of zavala 2000 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
 by the way then another thing that does not block lie the discovered the mass that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.329
 infrared massaguÃ© 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.829
 infrared cover 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.289
 with the satellite in 1983 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.980
 he had a Navarrese national weight is evident 15 19 13 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.210
 worth for what should have been chosen its weight only four are effective for 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 clear the reduction in welterweight but good in the end such thing the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.649
 wood 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.249
 we create general oscar orange 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.249
 mexico df however the defenders of 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.280
 firm defender of this planet the team that accounts and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.920
 intensifies and time of an era and is what achieves part of a little more 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.560
 of extraterrestrial indeed 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.750
 double of nibiru 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.000
 comes because the nurses proved superior they even say they do not usually 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.170
 have a family 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 in the first, the planet is represented four thousand years ago 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.640
 who in particular 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.160
 upper koldo 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.840
 and there is a series like that principle there is a civilization we are 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 more than we are the food 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.170
 we will design - of course and what they want is to know how we are evolving 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.750
 as it was 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.680
 It was prosperous city 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 they speak of this little witness so that those who 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.570
 for the Mayans 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.490
 in your long count calendar you know what's coming 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.690
 the book of the dead the buildings 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.110
 also deceased colleague patricia edil 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.510
 see clearly how it identifies the separated hour of the storms 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.550
 solar finally reversal 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.550
 del marne scissor version of the forum sun the v 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.409
 in the book of honor the building has in fact written this book has 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.380
 enough followers 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 but we're going away could not fail too has now been discovered that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 there is some prophecy that says that for 2012 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.580
 political and scientific weapon 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.640
 san clemente 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.650
 Fish said it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.810
 and what we need computers 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.830
 It's done 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.070
 and tinelli because you can see that a program called bombos 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.140
 that the media have already spoken about a program 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.489
 developed for voice tracking 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.209
 for the stock market to know how to drink some movement that is going to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.620
 do 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.069
 the nations and with stupor and invest sell buy 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.779
 good for faults 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:22.999
 in his time 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.999
 this octopus announced a financial catastrophe 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.149
 for what date 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.619
 September 11 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.909
 It continues past September 11 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:35.940
 but also 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 with snares in 2004 I wanted to insure 2004 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.659
 is one of them 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.569
 is the first time I also agreed and that is the parent centers but 2012 says 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.439
 that something is going to happen 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.369
 the congress nobody nobody can ensure 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:54.429
 - we 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.599
 understands that there is 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.760
 nor that it ceases to exist 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.359
 the very big universe 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.879
 the unexpected return in its entirety 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.199
 It has a lot of ease that there are things that our background b 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.069
 and that our equipment is not good 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.809
 there could be a planet x surely there will be sometime there but I do not think 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.809
 be the planet of the apocalypse whereby 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.429
 I would say that the staff did not worry 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.699
 yes 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.079
 let's see the little visibility by the designated to the own land the one that 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:24.869
 we live 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.279
 he was mistreating and what we can talk about and what we should 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.979
 worry about worrying about a hypothetical nibiru in charge suddenly 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.589
 or for a planet that is going to match our life and we're going badly down 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.209
 moved away 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.979
 enter scientifically ore 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.619
 so next week we'll continue counting things 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:46.459
 trying to identify in 2012 in Oran case both fed the movies because 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.089
 the 2012 sound not exactly 3 once 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.329
 and we continued
