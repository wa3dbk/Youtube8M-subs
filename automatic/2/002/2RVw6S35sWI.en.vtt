00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:27.140
 Okay, okay. 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:41.380
 he hopes that kaka speaks beauty guys 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.930
 pure tranquility welcome 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.150
 there the page from December to fitch 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 this is the continuation of the class is 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.960
 putting a differentiated technique for 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.379
 do color bidding 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.320
 I made it pretty colorful that I wanted 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.040
 obviously change the tones for us until 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.769
 there are other combinations 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.130
 people can do using material that 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.930
 is cheap or that the marker that co2 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.479
 is sold in any stationery material 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.909
 expensive are already using 40 search 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:18.250
 no other pen with 11 functions and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.420
 more sophisticated techniques, let us say 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.820
 people have materials that are much more 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 expensive but the channel goal is not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.600
 demanding that you use is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.430
 easy access where you can make a 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.750
 quality drawing 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.890
 hence I am making various combinations 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.570
 I'm wearing red yellow pink and it 's a 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.109
 very colorful letter because like I said 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.820
 the idea is just to see in 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.219
 each letter with the compositions you 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.560
 could be doing with your letter 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.170
 graffitied will be able to match whatever 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.049
 yellow with white yellow pink rose 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.850
 blue green and yellow at last several 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.689
 even combinations I hope you guys 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.640
 get a little later 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.170
 finally put in the letter of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.570
 you 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.070
 He says something else, too. 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.729
 is following here for the first time 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.740
 has a page called list of the week and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.260
 I usually put the most 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.650
 current in the last weeks and months 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.080
 2 more and the last two weeks is 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.150
 there the most current content of the channel 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.290
 then take a look when you have a time 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 and I saw that we already have 85 videos and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.830
 This is really cool, you're going. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.870
 able to observe other techniques, 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.209
 good to get back to that matter of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.269
 several compositions in the letter s I am 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.280
 making a mixture with 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.319
 See area of pink I made there or 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 these loose lines 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.159
 Left to kick the pa 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 create an illusion there of gradient 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.659
 I'm also going through orange 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.989
 the top of the yellow and removing the 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.000
 of the letter minimizing the truth in 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.010
 some areas were still white 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.010
 but it's cool when you can 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.430
 explore the tiny white part 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.169
 the less white part in the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.879
 program learns right 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.840
 the teacher used to tell me 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.480
 how much is the white amount of the drawing 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.230
 means to give the air of professionalism 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.019
 higher anyway 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.239
 but there it is quite this region 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.669
 white and trying to let the boy 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.489
 impossible to see 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.680
 good people I'm in real'm sleepy 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.250
 Now we're getting there at midnight. 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.620
 half already has some more impediments there 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.049
 to get up the channel 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.269
 the video for the channel was a bit lacking 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.739
 sleepy and that's what I wanted 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.189
 thank everyone who is 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.650
 access is is if you want to take two 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.120
 Be at ease, we 'll answer in the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.530
 as far as possible 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.319
 the question also have a corre corre 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.569
 damn but I'm always responding 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.120
 I can take a few more hours 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.569
 I have no doubt I'll respond to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.049
 galera is briefly that's it 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.570
 the result of this video lesson people already 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.599
 is available on the blog on facebook 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.090
 if you are still an advisor, the link is not 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:26.900
 here in the description is just a click 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.430
 but enjoy the content you spend 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.620
 have access to all content of 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.419
 video is cool because she stays 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.070
 organized and if you want to search 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.500
 a video lesson you find easily 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.030
 And the advantage is that in the end this 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.520
 channel every week we are putting 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.460
 new videos there if you miss a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.110
 Go there and get what you want. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.180
 it's happening 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.800
 and just like in the blog also the content 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.380
 of the blog stays there and we can 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.720
 organize everything 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.800
 It's really cool, good people, let me go back. 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.490
 speak the letter 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.550
 Note that I put it is pink over 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.380
 the roger and put red on top of the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.810
 when orange because I put a 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.910
 red over green orange and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.890
 I put dark green on the green I went 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.020
 working many colors 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.810
 the letter very colorful because as I said 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.200
 At the beginning of the video you believe in 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.000
 beginning of this video I, who precisely 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.310
 try several different colors 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 compositions for later you try 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.310
 observe in using some of these 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780
 compositions in your lyrics are 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.790
 making the chile nor the color purple 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.160
 It got a little dark that not only did 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.390
 is good to evaluate more briefly 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.850
 this is it people 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.500
 Good strong hug and thank you 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.880
 people will now proceed in the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.380
 fan art 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.510
 I know why I 'm deserving because I'm going 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.280
 have to also comment on what is 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.620
 happening in the art of the fans so let's 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.750
 Let's talk a little bit about fan art. 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.580
 of graphite and we start with isabela 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.520
