00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.360
 Today I am at the University of Sydney with Dr. Phil Dooley, 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.980
 We will talk about how our concept of the atom changes from a very small solid spherical body, 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.520
 To something more complex. 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 Does this have anything to do with it? Exactly I've been hit. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 It was a very important historical experience! 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.660
 It was a very important historical experience! 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 It is made up only of a glass tube connected to a vacuum pump, 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.340
 It is made up only of a glass tube connected to a vacuum pump, 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.690
 Inside the glass tube there are two pieces of metal (poles) connected to a high-voltage power supply. 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.840
 So we can suck the air from here. That's true. 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.230
 And then apply high voltage across the poles. Yeah. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.900
 Usually when the voltage is high in the air we do not get anything else - maybe - a big spark. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.400
 Usually when the voltage is high in the air we do not get anything else - maybe - a big spark. 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.920
 But what Gassler, who carried out this experiment in 1857, 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.940
 It was a completely different thing. Well, do you take a look at it? 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.560
 Let's do it. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.100
 Well, to take care of the pump, 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.600
 High Voltage Volts, 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 We turn off the lights so we can see what happens. 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.330
 As you can see, 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.620
 Something is happening now! 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.520
 That's true. I see a slight rosy glow there. 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.800
 That's true. So imagine that Gassler was the first person to see this at all! 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.360
 It was very surprising that he stimulated people's thinking of "what are these things that come out of the airstrip"? 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.860
 It was very surprising that he stimulated people's thinking of "what are these things that come out of the airstrip"? 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.820
 They look like rays emitted from a charge electrode, which they call the helipad. This is called the airstrip. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 They look like rays emitted from a charge electrode, which they call the helipad. This is called the airstrip. 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.060
 Became the subject of research for the next 40 years 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.480
 Because all the important figures in physics and science tried to solve what was happening. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 So what did they discover? I mean what is going on? What is this glare here? 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 There were two main teams: 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.980
 One of the teams thought it was waves, 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.020
 While the other team believed electricity was being transported by a torrent of charged particles. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.840
 First they concluded over the past 40 years .. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.900
 In fact Joseph was John Thompson, in 1897, who discovered that there was 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.760
 A torrent of small particles charged, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.040
 With negative charges, 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.680
 They are smaller than corn. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.340
 The mass of these particles is approximately one-thousandth of the mass of the lighter atoms, the hydrogen atom. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 The mass of these particles is approximately one-thousandth of the mass of the lighter atoms, the hydrogen atom. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.220
 It does not matter the nature of the metal used, 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.120
 It does not matter the nature of the metal used, 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.769
 Because the particle is always the same, it appears to us that this particle exists in everything. 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.930
 This electron, as he knew, transmits electricity. 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.580
 So Thompson concluded that all atoms had this particle as one of its components? 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.480
 That's true. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.120
 It was not a pool ball! There must be something inside the billiard ball. 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.100
 So how can I imagine a pool ball inside with small pieces? 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 Well, maybe you should imagine pudding. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.599
 Pudding? Yes, that was his idea, it was a peach pie, 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.220
 Very dear to the heart of every British person. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.720
 You are right. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.880
 Inside the pudding there are pieces of peaches, peach cuttings can come out of them, 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.080
 When the high voltage is applied, the electron is negative, 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.640
 Which Thompson portrayed as a piece of peach, leaving behind a positive pudding. 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.219
 Which Thompson portrayed as a piece of peach, leaving behind a positive pudding. 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.249
 Are you a fan of peach pies? 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.880
 If for research purposes, definitely! 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 Well, let's see if we could look more for this. Well it sounds fun. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.660
