00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.860
 We interrupted the current program broadcast emergency news 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.180
 Download it from P2P, mom 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 Quickly send files to block P2P downloads before dark today 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.030
 P2P download is being blocked by the SARFT 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.460
 They won BTChina! 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.490
 These terrible news 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.120
 File - issued! 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.860
 Download speed is oscillating 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 The forum is a gossip 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.600
 This page cannot be displayed! 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.250
 All netizens noticed that they immediately gave up the BT download immediately after receiving instructions from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 They don't let us BT download! 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.100
 What about my American drama! 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.080
 what is this? 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.480
 Radio and television files! ! ! 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.460
 Turn underground IP~ fast! 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.390
 What a terrible sight 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 Grass mud horse! It is also the SARFT that owes *! 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 COME ON~ It's time to fight back! 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.490
 Brothers, open up! 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.670
 The otaku and the rotten girl are ready! 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.400
 The otaku rotten girl has other orders! 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.550
 All proxy servers are open to support you. 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.490
 When the "This page cannot be displayed" appears, change it! 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 Here is the end of the world, understand! 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.710
 Did you hear that? Open! 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.860
 Here is Baidu Post Bar, received! 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 The forum is upset... 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.410
 There is also Emule... 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.260
 The reason why I was sent by radio and television was to kill illegal P2P downloads! 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 VeryCD seems to have a chance, although it has already been put on the top 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 You must avoid the limelight first, stop it for the time being. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 However, why? 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.730
 They will be under the file! 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.420
 Is the VeryCD really going to reopen? 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.070
 good news! VeryCD heroes decided to open this afternoon! 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.680
 With us, I don't believe that there are still P2P illegal download sites to dare to confront our Radio and Television Invincible Directorate! 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.290
 Netizens! Today we want to recapture P2P network sharing! 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.810
 Feel free to open! 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.060
 I stared at him, the VeryCD! 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.190
 The attitude of radio and television is really fast! 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.560
 Open service! VeryCD! 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.820
 VeryCD opened! 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.590
 Hello, everyone P2P network sharing website... 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.740
 I don't know about this sharing or piracy... 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.580
 However, I still have a season of GOSSIP GIRLS not downloaded... 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.760
 Baidu Holy Beast also decided to support us urgently! 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.410
 Radio and television said P2P download is pirated! 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.450
 What kind of plane! We are sharing on the web! 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.070
 What are they fart... 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.910
 In addition, half of the female netizens are waiting for the return of the next episode of GOSSIP GIRLS! 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.560
 No one can stop P2P downloads, even if the central direct file is not working! 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.260
 I know this is dangerous... 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.140
 However, really... it’s time to try Thunder! 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.190
 Recapture P2P network sharing! 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 For the anime, movies and American dramas you love! 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.320
 For the hope of netizens! 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.950
 For the hope of P2P! 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.420
 For our better tomorrow! 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.930
 Go and download with P2P... 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.030
 Although P2P is not very safe 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 But at least we haven’t put Emule in it yet.... 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 Even in the long night of darkness, the dawn of dawn will come...
