00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
mirrors set incorrectly I've got my

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.450 
mirrors set incorrectly I've got my
mirrors<00:00:36.630> set<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.170> most<00:00:37.500> people<00:00:37.920> would<00:00:38.129> set

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
mirrors set like most people would set

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030 
mirrors set like most people would set
theirs<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> give<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> an

example of how most people set their

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
example of how most people set their
mirrors<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> why<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.140> incorrect

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
mirrors and why it's incorrect

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
mirrors and why it's incorrect
I'll<00:00:47.039> give<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.399> idea<00:00:47.520> there's<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.510> it

I'll give you an idea there's what it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.000 
I'll give you an idea there's what it
looks<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.110> pretty<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.860> eye

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
looks like that's pretty much from eye

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
looks like that's pretty much from eye
level<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.780> looking<00:00:52.020> hopefully<00:00:52.680> I'm

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
level where I'm looking hopefully I'm

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.069 
level where I'm looking hopefully I'm
aimed<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.670> rearview<00:00:53.879> mirror<00:00:53.969> there<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> go

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
aimed at the rearview mirror there we go

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
aimed at the rearview mirror there we go
so<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.219> what's<00:00:56.430> behind<00:00:56.579> us<00:00:56.910> you'll

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
so you can see what's behind us you'll

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
so you can see what's behind us you'll
notice<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.230> cannot<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.920> any<00:00:59.160> cars

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
notice that you cannot see any cars

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
notice that you cannot see any cars
behind<00:00:59.850> us<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.359> cars<00:01:00.750> around<00:01:01.289> me<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
behind us there are cars around me in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579 
behind us there are cars around me in
the<00:01:01.920> parking<00:01:02.250> spaces<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> give

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the parking spaces and I want to give

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
the parking spaces and I want to give
you<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> quick<00:01:04.949> example<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.060> talking

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you a quick example of what I'm talking

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
you a quick example of what I'm talking
about<00:01:06.479> here

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
about here

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.859 
about here
why<00:01:07.560> setting<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> sideview<00:01:08.700> mirrors<00:01:09.210> like

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
why setting your sideview mirrors like

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.469 
why setting your sideview mirrors like
most<00:01:10.170> people<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> incorrect<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> look

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
most people do is incorrect if you look

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
most people do is incorrect if you look
at<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.140> side<00:01:13.500> view<00:01:13.710> mirror<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.340> from

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
at that side view mirror and that's from

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.960 
at that side view mirror and that's from
eye<00:01:14.970> level<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:16.220> drivers<00:01:17.220> position<00:01:17.790> where<00:01:17.939> my

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
eye level at drivers position where my

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
eye level at drivers position where my
head<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.540> normally<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
head would normally be you can just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.300 
head would normally be you can just
barely<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> car<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.020> mirror<00:01:22.979> now

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
barely see a car in that mirror now

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
barely see a car in that mirror now
position<00:01:23.970> my<00:01:24.210> car<00:01:24.509> where<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
position my car where you can see that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
position my car where you can see that
and<00:01:26.369> I'll<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.630> closer<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and I'll get you a little closer so you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
and I'll get you a little closer so you
can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.780> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
can see that you can see that it's just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010 
can see that you can see that it's just
almost<00:01:31.770> gone<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.930> little

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
almost gone and I can back up a little

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.039 
almost gone and I can back up a little
bit<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> create<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.860> blind<00:01:35.460> spot<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.270> there

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
bit and create a blind spot right there

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859 
bit and create a blind spot right there
that<00:01:37.950> means<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.579> would<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.790> no<00:01:39.150> idea<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> can

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that means you would have no idea I can

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.620 
that means you would have no idea I can
back<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:41.070> enough<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> can't<00:01:42.329> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
back up just enough that we can't really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.429 
back up just enough that we can't really
see<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.020> car<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.530> peripheral<00:01:44.159> vision<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.439> we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
see that car in peripheral vision and we

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.280 
see that car in peripheral vision and we

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
car in that mirror it's not yet far

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
car in that mirror it's not yet far
enough<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.560> side<00:01:58.770> window

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
enough if you look at my side window

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
enough if you look at my side window
it's<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.310> yet<00:01:59.520> far<00:01:59.820> enough<00:02:00.000> forward<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.439> in

it's not yet far enough forward to be in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
it's not yet far enough forward to be in
my<00:02:01.770> peripheral<00:02:02.189> vision<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:03.060> lost<00:02:03.329> sight

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
my peripheral vision I have lost sight

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
my peripheral vision I have lost sight
of<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> car<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:05.130> means<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.729> change

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
of this car this means I could change

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.990 
of this car this means I could change
lanes<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.899> top<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.310> cause<00:02:08.789> an

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
lanes right on top of it and cause an

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
lanes right on top of it and cause an
accident<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> crash<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.770> no

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
accident or a crash there are no

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.959 
accident or a crash there are no
accidents<00:02:11.129> only<00:02:11.610> mistake

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
accidents only mistake

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.720 
accidents only mistake
so<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> would<00:02:14.980> create<00:02:15.189> a<00:02:15.370> panic

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so you know that I would create a panic

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.160 
so you know that I would create a panic
situation<00:02:15.879> if<00:02:16.329> nothing<00:02:16.810> else<00:02:16.959> for<00:02:17.049> that

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
situation if nothing else for that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.199 
situation if nothing else for that
driver<00:02:17.469> now<00:02:17.980> over<00:02:18.310> here<00:02:18.579> if<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.760> look<00:02:19.030> out

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
driver now over here if you look out

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.970 
driver now over here if you look out
this<00:02:19.359> window<00:02:19.719> you'll<00:02:20.109> see<00:02:20.319> there's<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> big<00:02:20.769> SUV

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
this window you'll see there's a big SUV

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.720 
this window you'll see there's a big SUV
and<00:02:21.790> that's<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.870> within<00:02:23.560> my<00:02:24.219> peripheral

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and that's just within my peripheral

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.940 
and that's just within my peripheral
vision<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.090> I'm<00:02:25.209> paying<00:02:25.540> attention<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:26.560> I'm

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
vision if I'm paying attention if I'm

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.160 
vision if I'm paying attention if I'm
not<00:02:27.099> paying<00:02:27.400> attention<00:02:27.549> that<00:02:28.030> big<00:02:28.510> SUV<00:02:28.959> right

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
not paying attention that big SUV right

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.349 
not paying attention that big SUV right
there<00:02:29.379> may<00:02:30.370> slip<00:02:30.760> past<00:02:31.090> me

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
there may slip past me

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.509 
there may slip past me
certainly<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.019> can't<00:02:32.349> see<00:02:32.590> any<00:02:32.829> part<00:02:33.159> of<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
certainly I can't see any part of it in

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.780 
certainly I can't see any part of it in
the<00:02:33.700> rearview<00:02:33.909> mirror<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:34.859> here's<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:36.549> way

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the rearview mirror now here's the way

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.699 
the rearview mirror now here's the way
most<00:02:37.180> people<00:02:37.510> think<00:02:37.750> about<00:02:37.930> their<00:02:38.290> mirrors

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
most people think about their mirrors

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.990 
most people think about their mirrors
I'm<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.129> pull<00:02:39.310> back<00:02:39.340> forward<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:39.909> little

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
I'm going to pull back forward a little

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.670 
I'm going to pull back forward a little
bit<00:02:40.150> here<00:02:42.540> okay<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.599> both<00:02:43.959> these<00:02:44.170> cars<00:02:44.439> are

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
bit here okay so both these cars are

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.569 
bit here okay so both these cars are
right<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:44.950> my<00:02:45.069> flank

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
right on my flank

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.849 
right on my flank
in<00:02:45.639> the<00:02:46.090> lanes<00:02:46.329> where<00:02:46.989> they<00:02:47.260> would<00:02:47.409> be<00:02:47.530> around

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
in the lanes where they would be around

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.659 
in the lanes where they would be around
me<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:49.510> do<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.079> little<00:02:50.230> adjusting<00:02:50.709> now<00:02:51.519> if

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
me actually do a little adjusting now if

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.460 
me actually do a little adjusting now if
you'll<00:02:51.790> notice<00:02:51.849> in<00:02:52.389> that<00:02:52.480> sideview<00:02:52.989> mirror<00:02:53.319> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
you'll notice in that sideview mirror I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.110 
you'll notice in that sideview mirror I
can<00:02:53.530> see<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.889> all<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.340> way<00:02:54.430> down<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.849> side<00:02:55.090> of

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
can see you all the way down the side of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.940 
can see you all the way down the side of
my<00:02:55.450> car<00:02:55.689> that's<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.049> way<00:02:56.200> most<00:02:56.379> people<00:02:56.709> set

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
my car that's the way most people set

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.470 
my car that's the way most people set
their<00:02:57.069> mirrors<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.430> feel<00:02:57.669> like<00:02:57.849> they<00:02:58.120> need

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
their mirrors they feel like they need

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
their mirrors they feel like they need
to<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.280> sides<00:03:00.669> of<00:03:01.000> their<00:03:01.150> car<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.989> get<00:03:02.200> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
to see the sides of their car to get a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.089 
to see the sides of their car to get a
reference<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.519> where<00:03:04.079> their<00:03:05.079> vehicle<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.650> that

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
reference of where their vehicle is that

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.550 
reference of where their vehicle is that
is<00:03:06.310> incorrect<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.389> do<00:03:07.540> not<00:03:07.780> need<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.230> see<00:03:08.409> your

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
is incorrect you do not need to see your

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.839 
is incorrect you do not need to see your
own<00:03:08.680> car<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:08.980> know<00:03:09.340> what<00:03:09.489> your<00:03:09.609> car<00:03:09.819> looks

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
own car you know what your car looks

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.610 
own car you know what your car looks
like<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.629> don't<00:03:10.750> need<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.019> look<00:03:11.139> at<00:03:11.349> it<00:03:11.470> while

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
like you don't need to look at it while

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.890 
like you don't need to look at it while
you're<00:03:11.769> going<00:03:11.859> down<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.250> road<00:03:12.780> certainly<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
you're going down the road certainly you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.569 
you're going down the road certainly you
don't<00:03:14.049> need<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.379> know<00:03:14.530> what's<00:03:14.799> an<00:03:14.950> inch<00:03:15.340> off

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
don't need to know what's an inch off

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.490 
don't need to know what's an inch off
your<00:03:15.909> bumper<00:03:16.209> because<00:03:16.359> no<00:03:16.780> car<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.260> going<00:03:17.409> to

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
your bumper because no car is going to

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.619 
your bumper because no car is going to
be<00:03:17.769> an<00:03:18.010> inch<00:03:18.220> off<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.639> bumper<00:03:18.849> unless<00:03:19.419> you're

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
be an inch off your bumper unless you're

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.869 
be an inch off your bumper unless you're
in<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> middle<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.109> a<00:03:20.169> crash<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:21.609> know<00:03:21.699> and

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
in the middle of a crash you know and

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.920 
in the middle of a crash you know and
you're<00:03:22.150> not<00:03:22.180> going<00:03:22.389> to<00:03:22.449> be<00:03:22.510> worried<00:03:22.750> about

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you're not going to be worried about

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.330 
you're not going to be worried about
your<00:03:23.079> mirrors<00:03:23.409> at<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.709> point<00:03:23.949> mirror

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
your mirrors at that point mirror

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.089 
your mirrors at that point mirror
placement<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.599> most<00:03:25.810> people<00:03:26.079> do<00:03:26.409> this<00:03:26.709> because

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
placement so most people do this because

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.830 
placement so most people do this because
they've<00:03:27.250> never<00:03:27.370> been<00:03:27.489> told<00:03:27.819> otherwise<00:03:28.090> have

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
they've never been told otherwise have

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.360 
they've never been told otherwise have
that<00:03:29.049> mirror<00:03:29.260> all<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.739> way<00:03:29.799> down<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.159> side

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that mirror all the way down the side

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.170 
that mirror all the way down the side
will<00:03:30.639> guess<00:03:31.329> what<00:03:31.449> it<00:03:31.780> creates<00:03:32.139> blind<00:03:32.470> spots

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
will guess what it creates blind spots

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.180 
will guess what it creates blind spots
and<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.419> don't<00:03:34.629> want<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.590> what<00:03:35.829> we<00:03:35.949> want

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
and we don't want that so what we want

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.550 
and we don't want that so what we want
to<00:03:36.250> do<00:03:36.579> in<00:03:36.909> order<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.659> correct<00:03:38.139> this<00:03:38.379> situation

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
to do in order to correct this situation

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.460 
to do in order to correct this situation
is<00:03:39.190> take<00:03:39.579> our<00:03:39.729> chin<00:03:40.090> put<00:03:40.389> it<00:03:40.479> right<00:03:40.810> over<00:03:41.049> that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
is take our chin put it right over that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.180 
is take our chin put it right over that
center<00:03:41.949> console<00:03:42.699> lean<00:03:43.479> over<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.409> your<00:03:44.739> chin<00:03:45.040> is

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
center console lean over so your chin is

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.129 
center console lean over so your chin is
right<00:03:45.519> in<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.699> middle<00:03:45.729> of<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.030> car<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.449> then

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
right in the middle of the car and then

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.420 
right in the middle of the car and then
look<00:03:47.379> out<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.680> mirror<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.629> adjust<00:03:49.629> it<00:03:49.840> out

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
look out that mirror and adjust it out

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.240 
look out that mirror and adjust it out
so<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:52.389> barely<00:03:53.260> see<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.889> back

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
so that you can just barely see the back

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
so that you can just barely see the back
of<00:03:54.519> your<00:03:54.849> vehicle<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.930> how<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.129> can

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250

just<00:03:57.370> barely<00:03:57.609> see<00:03:57.819> them<00:03:58.209> look<00:03:58.449> how<00:03:58.599> much<00:03:58.870> more

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
just barely see them look how much more

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.649
