 I hope that we will get it right 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.679
 qualifying action can still offer 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.430
 that the conditions allow it 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.200

 work in other words, stand tomorrow 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.980
 We again freshly overhauled 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 Microphones sat in the cabin and when 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 of course you then the second and third 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 qualifying session still at home 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 deliver 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 Well and goodbye ours shows them 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 directing again as a repetition 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.180
 Pictures from the fast round of running 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 the choice on this route 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 the round him at the moment on the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.590
 provisional pole position brings 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.660
 You hear very clearly when braking 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 working the flywheel hybrid that is 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.100
 that high five noise that in the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100
 brake zone occurs 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.690
 pay attention he immediately 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.690
 get back in the iron 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.170
 you can already see that was a good one 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.649
 round there too 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.539
 in the mulsanne curve already hard over 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.539
 the curbs exploited everything 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.519
 So that was already a round of the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.329
 boy in a nutshell 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.329
 compliment 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.290
 Jasas quite unspectacular does not look 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.210
 after 330 340 km / h now because of with 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.690
 no less than 300 at this curve 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.060
 brake back third gear for the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.520
 indian police go left then 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.570
 we come to the slowest in place 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.530
 arch about 65 70 km h also a bit 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.940
 maybe further 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.680
 now tick faster so there is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.450
 have a lot of sv two meters again 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.770
 I have seen it happen in the now 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.770
 exit 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.930
 every meter is crucial line is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.380
 the key to success is line 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.600
 important for the resulting 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.170
 speed now porsche porsche curves 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.830
 So again with 330 340 the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.710
 are the approximately 270 km h 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:12.770
 almost logically powerful forces up to 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.590
 4g peak briefly in the head of the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.350
 porsche section and then go to 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.880
 last chicane on again 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.620
 start and aim for this double 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.810
 Chicanes have seen some action today 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.970
 Also there is about the curbs was 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.910
 Of course, always try something too 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.300
 shorter shorten cut away the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.300
 fastest
