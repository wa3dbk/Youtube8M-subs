again I emphasize on the if if there is

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.590 
again I emphasize on the if if there is
crew<00:04:24.460> could<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.760> imagine<00:04:25.030> putting<00:04:25.419> together

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
crew could you imagine putting together

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.420 
crew could you imagine putting together
the<00:04:25.870> perfect<00:04:26.080> crew<00:04:26.530> having<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.190> floor

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
the perfect crew having the floor

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.220 
the perfect crew having the floor
general<00:04:27.910> having<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.210> guy<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.540> specializes<00:04:29.200> in

defense<00:04:29.830> raising<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.760> energy<00:04:31.150> around<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
defense raising the energy around you

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.080 
defense raising the energy around you
getting<00:04:32.440> your<00:04:32.560> players<00:04:32.800> pumped<00:04:33.310> up<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.700> don't

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
getting your players pumped up I don't

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.670 
getting your players pumped up I don't
know<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.240> guess<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.690> may<00:04:35.290> be<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.560> minority

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
know I guess I may be in the minority

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.120 
know I guess I may be in the minority
when<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.430> look<00:04:36.639> at<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:36.880> kind<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.270> stuff<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:38.130> I

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
when I look at this kind of stuff and I

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.530 
when I look at this kind of stuff and I
actually<00:04:39.220> found<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:39.820> pretty<00:04:40.000> funny<00:04:40.360> out

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
actually found this pretty funny out

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.690 
actually found this pretty funny out
I've<00:04:40.840> read<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.800> I've<00:04:41.919> come<00:04:42.130> across<00:04:42.250> that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
I've read and I've come across that

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.640 
I've read and I've come across that
there<00:04:43.120> will<00:04:43.330> be<00:04:43.360> technicals<00:04:44.050> in<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.320> kinect

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
there will be technicals in the kinect

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.370 
there will be technicals in the kinect
version<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.120> say<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> bad<00:04:46.630> word<00:04:46.660> I

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
version so if you you say a bad word I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.520 
version so if you you say a bad word I
guess<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.790> way<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:48.970> put<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.270> then<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
guess is the way to put that then the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.240 
guess is the way to put that then the
computer<00:04:50.860> will<00:04:51.040> give<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:51.820> technical<00:04:52.540> file

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
computer will give you a technical file

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.469 
computer will give you a technical file
kind<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.370> makes<00:04:54.490> you<00:04:54.639> want<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.940> get<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.150> kinect

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
kind of makes you want to get the kinect

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.629 
kind of makes you want to get the kinect
version<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.990> little<00:04:56.229> bit<00:04:56.410> but<00:04:57.040> once<00:04:57.250> again<00:04:57.370> I'm

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
version a little bit but once again I'm

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.700 
version a little bit but once again I'm
going<00:04:58.240> back<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.750> physics<00:04:59.139> I<00:04:59.229> was<00:04:59.350> talking

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
going back to the physics I was talking

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.650 
going back to the physics I was talking
about<00:04:59.919> it<00:05:00.040> says<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.760> physics<00:05:01.180> system<00:05:01.540> is

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
about it says the the physics system is

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.020 
about it says the the physics system is
introduced<00:05:02.110> by<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.770> dynamics<00:05:03.370> generator

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
introduced by the dynamics generator

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.370 
introduced by the dynamics generator
once<00:05:04.270> again<00:05:04.540> I've<00:05:04.690> never<00:05:04.960> heard<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.320> this

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
once again I've never heard of this

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.440 
once again I've never heard of this
before<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:06.220> also<00:05:06.340> affects<00:05:06.760> rebounding<00:05:07.360> and

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
before it also affects rebounding and

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.540 
before it also affects rebounding and
blocking<00:05:07.870> collisions<00:05:08.290> and<00:05:08.410> charging<00:05:08.979> savvy

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
blocking collisions and charging savvy

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.040 
blocking collisions and charging savvy
defenders<00:05:10.060> will<00:05:10.180> actually<00:05:10.450> take<00:05:10.570> charge<00:05:10.900> this

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
defenders will actually take charge this

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.290 
defenders will actually take charge this
year<00:05:11.200> like<00:05:11.290> I've<00:05:11.500> said<00:05:11.740> earlier<00:05:12.210> speaking<00:05:13.210> of

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
year like I've said earlier speaking of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.820 
year like I've said earlier speaking of
Defense<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.870> players<00:05:14.110> have<00:05:14.320> more<00:05:14.530> smooth

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
Defense the players have more smooth

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.010 
Defense the players have more smooth
movement<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.580> our<00:05:16.150> defense<00:05:16.600> actually<00:05:16.870> Peter

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
movement and our defense actually Peter

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.780 
movement and our defense actually Peter
