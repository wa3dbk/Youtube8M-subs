about<00:00:02.669> aligning<00:00:03.419> arranging<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.259> grouping<00:00:04.650> in

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
about aligning arranging and grouping in

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.099 
about aligning arranging and grouping in
PowerPoint<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:06.390> let's<00:00:06.600> look<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> scenario

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
PowerPoint so let's look at a scenario

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.410 
PowerPoint so let's look at a scenario
let's<00:00:08.069> say<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> slide<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> you've

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
let's say you have a slide and you've

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.390 
let's say you have a slide and you've
got<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> bunch<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.230> different<00:00:10.349> shapes<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.190> that

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
got a bunch of different shapes on that

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.240 
got a bunch of different shapes on that
slide<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.870> decide<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.710> want<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
slide and you decide that you want to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430 
slide and you decide that you want to
sort<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.940> make<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> line<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> these<00:00:15.960> shape<00:00:16.260> so

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
sort of make a line of these shape so

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
sort of make a line of these shape so
I'm<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.859> align<00:00:17.820> these<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.720> across

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
I'm going to align these up going across

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.990 
I'm going to align these up going across
and<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.130> nice<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.670> evenly

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and I want them to be nice and evenly

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750 
and I want them to be nice and evenly
spaced<00:00:21.480> now<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.590> you'll<00:00:22.769> notice<00:00:22.830> first<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
spaced now what you'll notice first is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.000 
spaced now what you'll notice first is
that<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.390> shapes<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> far<00:00:25.529> left

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that one of these shapes on the far left

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.000 
that one of these shapes on the far left
is<00:00:26.400> probably<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.510> spot<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.830> what

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is probably in the right spot so what

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
is probably in the right spot so what
I'll<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.519> I'll<00:00:29.789> take<00:00:29.970> another<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
I'll do now is I'll take another one of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
I'll do now is I'll take another one of
these<00:00:30.750> shapes<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> I'll<00:00:31.470> move<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
these shapes and I'll move it over to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860 
these shapes and I'll move it over to
the<00:00:32.219> far<00:00:32.369> right<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.300> doesn't<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.660> matter

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the far right it doesn't really matter

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.299 
the far right it doesn't really matter
whether<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.320> lined<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.130> what

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
whether it's lined up or not what

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
whether it's lined up or not what
matters<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.050> spot

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
matters is that it's in the right spot

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.100 
matters is that it's in the right spot
on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> far<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:38.070> hand<00:00:38.100> side<00:00:38.690> now<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
on the far right hand side now that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.590 
on the far right hand side now that
they're<00:00:40.290> spread<00:00:40.890> across<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
they're spread across what we can do is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900 
they're spread across what we can do is
we<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.140> ahead<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.680> hold<00:00:44.070> down<00:00:44.280> shift<00:00:44.730> on

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we can go ahead and hold down shift on

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
we can go ahead and hold down shift on
the<00:00:45.030> keyboard<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.649> select<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.129> other<00:00:47.370> shapes

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
the keyboard and select the other shapes
that<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> hold<00:00:49.020> down

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that are here so I'm going to hold down

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
that are here so I'm going to hold down
shift<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.710> click<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.190> shape<00:00:50.550> number<00:00:50.730> two

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
shape number three and shape number four

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
shape number three and shape number four
go<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.260> format<00:00:55.710> tab<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> top<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
go to my format tab up at the top of the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
go to my format tab up at the top of the
screen<00:00:57.059> click<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> align<00:00:58.230> drop<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.949> menu

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
screen click the align drop down menu

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
screen click the align drop down menu
and<00:00:59.460> you'll<00:00:59.579> notice<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.910> distribute

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and you'll notice that distribute

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
and you'll notice that distribute
horizontally<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.309> options<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
horizontally is one of your options so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
horizontally is one of your options so
horizontally<00:01:03.570> across<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> screen<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
horizontally across the screen and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.160 
horizontally across the screen and
that's<00:01:05.129> perfect<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> problem<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's perfect now the problem is that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
that's perfect now the problem is that
they're<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.320> lined<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.979> yet<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.790> they're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
they're not lined up yet so they're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.670 
they're not lined up yet so they're
evenly<00:01:09.390> spaced<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.930> they're<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.229> lined<00:01:10.439> up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
evenly spaced but they're not lined up

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
evenly spaced but they're not lined up
they're<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.130> selected<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.060> I've<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
they're all selected so all I've got to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
they're all selected so all I've got to
do<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> align<00:01:13.470> option<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
do is go back to the align option and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.820 
do is go back to the align option and
choose<00:01:14.520> align<00:01:15.240> middle<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> line<00:01:16.110> top<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
choose align middle or a line top really

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.810 
choose align middle or a line top really
doesn't<00:01:17.040> matter<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.340> they're<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
doesn't matter because they're all the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
doesn't matter because they're all the
same<00:01:17.880> size<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.930> I'll<00:01:19.020> choose<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> line<00:01:19.740> top<00:01:20.040> for

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
same size so I'll choose a line top for

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.649 
same size so I'll choose a line top for
example<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.330> they're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
example and there it is they're

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
example and there it is they're
beautifully<00:01:22.259> aligned<00:01:22.580> now<00:01:23.580> there's<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.060> more

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
beautifully aligned now there's one more

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.929 
beautifully aligned now there's one more
problem<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.170> might<00:01:25.560> come<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> watch

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
problem that might come up and watch

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
problem that might come up and watch
what<00:01:27.119> happens<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> try<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> move<00:01:28.290> one

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
what happens here if I try to move one

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
what happens here if I try to move one
of<00:01:28.619> these<00:01:28.740> shapes<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.610> rest<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> shapes

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of these shapes the rest of the shapes

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
of these shapes the rest of the shapes
stay<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.869> their<00:01:31.110> positions<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.640> order<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
stay in their positions so in order to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
stay in their positions so in order to
make<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.320> move<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> same
