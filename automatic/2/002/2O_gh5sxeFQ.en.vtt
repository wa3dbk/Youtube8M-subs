00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.550
 Madam President 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.320
 this cabinet has destroyed our beautiful country 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.240
 made 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.110
 and you can only get angry with that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.960
 and I am so angry 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.539
 everything that needs to grow shrinks 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.070
 our economy export it 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.949
 consumer confidence 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 the investments and everything that needs to be done 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 shrinking is growing at this cabinet 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 taxes 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.630
 the number of unemployed the bankruptcies 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.550
 Prime Minister Rutte derelict Chairman 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.800
 policy of tax increases and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 stupid cuts and we see the result 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 the Netherlands is impoverishing every day 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 the prime minister she signs in it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 youth news against children that he 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 do not have to cut back yourself but at home 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 Madam President is at home 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.989
 parents of many of these children 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.810
 crying closer than laughing 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.500
 the common man is the hard-working spool 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 Dutchman is the reel, the entrepreneur 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.159
 the reel spool it is the elderly 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.640
 pay the bill they become merciless 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.920
 hard-packed chairman fifty 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 bankruptcies and a thousand unemployed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 every day that is the gloomy one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.869
 balance sheet from 2013 to date and also 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.390
 today 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 s who speak a thousand fetsie jobs 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 fifty businesses 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.090
 Mr President, this is an economic drama 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.549
 this is a social massacre this is one 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 suffering for so many people 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.030
 companies 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.689
 for so many families that are so much better 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.729
 earn the Netherlands drowned and the big 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.360
 Guilty Madam President the Great 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 family days debts in box a the prime minister 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.520
 He is grabbing the wallets of the people 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.680
 empty 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.590
 and the only thing he has to offer is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.789
 unworldly drunk man speech 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.599
 buy a car 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.510
 buy a house that is his advice to whom 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.000
 no money but has those mortgages 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.400
 of more than one million families 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.129
 under water but come on come on buy one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.010
 big house says the prime minister 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.689
 chairman of course has that nonsense 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.060
 not helped 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.500
 How can you buy a house if you don't have one 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.989
 have more money 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.519
 and as if it is all not enough 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.310
 the Prime Minister Madam President now 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.069
 again 6 billion euros 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.590
 raise taxes again and see 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.139
 he then doesn't he doesn't see him 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.480
 in this way the economy is completely the 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:51.569
 The blow of the neck gives our prosperity 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.849
 totally closed it looks like president 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.040
 that the prime minister has his economics degree 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.200
 has put it in a hole 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.540
 college 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.989
 chairman three-quarters of the Dutch 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.549
 is against 6 billion extra 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.129
 and stupid cuts and 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.680
 burden increases even a majority 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.209
 of the vvd pebbles is against those six 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.159
 billion 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.540
 a majority of the PVDA voters 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.729
 rejects all new cuts and the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.419
 chairman of mkb-netherlands 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:27.150
 also a vvd'er at least may I say 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.530
 am a set in I don't do it yet 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.930
 once 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.479
 and chairman also who is mother 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.560
 understandably all that anger in the Netherlands 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.859
 is right 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.720
 this is not how you treat the netherlands 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.400
 and the cabinet does not learn from it 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.519
 mistakes maybe that's still it 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.560
 the worst strikes again every day 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.690
 new nail in our coffin 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.269
 economy and it only gets worse 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.250
 I said it all that rutte has six 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.689
 billion in new cuts 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.939
 command of brussels 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.109
 announced in which hefty 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.090
 burdens 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.409
 the netherlands look again and that 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.470
 We will probably in August 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.540
 have to deal with a heavy tax 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.479
 increases and in the meantime 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.250
 freight trains run full of every day 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.129
 dutch tax money to brussels 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.380
 to greece to cyprus and leave the 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.370
 brussels bag fillers the netherlands too 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.190
 another half a billion euros 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.980
 pay extra for our hard-earned money 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.880
 on top of the billions we already pay 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.870
 indeed sir rut indeed sir 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.180
 Samson 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.710
 the money has to roll but it does roll with you 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.940
 abroad 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.890
 the heart of your cabinet is not right 'for 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.800
 the netherlands chairman 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.830
 there is only one way to top it off 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.990
 and that is because of taxes too 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.480
 decrease not increase but too 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.030
 so that the economy can return 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.460
 grow so that entrepreneurs can breathe again 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.610
 so that people can do something again 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.920
 and that is possible that is possible by 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.590
 cutting those billions in spending on the 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.530
 European Union on development aid 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.990
 subsidies on those silly windmills 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.660
 mass immigration on all those other expensive ones 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.570
 left-hand hobbies 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.660
 Maat cabinet Madam President does 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.050
 exactly the opposite 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.880
 and my party the PVV will never agree 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.910
 agree 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.530
 The Netherlands will never agree 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.320
 and the Dutch Madam President 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.780
 let this be my message to the lord 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.720
 Rutte the Dutch will be tough 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.540
 deal with this demolition cabinet 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.540
 thank you so much thank you
