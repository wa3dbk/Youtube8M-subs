I didn't make the 1998 Olympic team I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.110 
I didn't make the 1998 Olympic team I
was<00:00:33.950> at<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.100> tryout<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.880> was<00:00:36.190> 17<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.970> was

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
was at the tryout I was 17 and I was

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.270 
was at the tryout I was 17 and I was
kind<00:00:38.330> of<00:00:38.390> an<00:00:38.510> underdog<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.260> it<00:00:40.010> would<00:00:40.190> have

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
kind of an underdog so it would have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.160 
kind of an underdog so it would have
been<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.400> long<00:00:40.610> shot<00:00:40.880> but<00:00:41.150> I<00:00:41.270> i<00:00:41.630> went<00:00:42.050> to<00:00:42.140> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
been a long shot but I i went to the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.840 
been a long shot but I i went to the
trial<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.710> gave<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.010> my<00:00:43.040> all<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:43.340> didn't<00:00:43.700> make<00:00:43.790> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
trial I gave it my all I didn't make it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.640 
trial I gave it my all I didn't make it
and<00:00:44.740> that<00:00:45.740> was<00:00:45.830> definitely<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.309> setback<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:47.650> I

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
and that was definitely a setback but I

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.690 
and that was definitely a setback but I
didn't<00:00:48.920> let<00:00:49.040> it<00:00:49.280> stop<00:00:49.400> me<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.300> didn't<00:00:50.780> let<00:00:50.989> it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
didn't let it stop me I didn't let it

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.670 
didn't let it stop me I didn't let it
shattered<00:00:52.700> my<00:00:52.880> next<00:00:53.150> goal<00:00:53.329> which<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.050> 2002

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
shattered my next goal which is the 2002

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.070 
shattered my next goal which is the 2002
on<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.010> team<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.630> think<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.050> that's

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
on the team and I think that that's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.750 
on the team and I think that that's
something<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.620> keep<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:57.920> mind<00:00:57.980> too<00:00:58.370> is<00:00:58.610> that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
something to keep in mind too is that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.549 
something to keep in mind too is that
you<00:00:58.910> will<00:00:59.059> have<00:00:59.270> setbacks<00:00:59.540> big<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.290> small

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559

you'll have small injuries you won't
make<00:01:03.110> big<00:01:03.379> teams<00:01:03.790> but<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.510> need<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.900> keep<00:01:05.930> your
