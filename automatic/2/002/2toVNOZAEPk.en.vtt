00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.760
Hi ... my name is ... Itachi Uchiha ...

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.440
and I am a member of the Akatsuki clan

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.980
Itachi Uchiha yeah

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.260
What do you mean this is a shitty name?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.020
Come on, tell me yours to see?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.500
Well so if you looked at my other videos, you should know that I have a lot of mangas

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.840
oh no no no, I have LOTS of mangas

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.720
WOW WOW WOW what are you doing ??

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.540
Stop it !

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.160
You want me to look like a pervert on the web or what ??

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.860
HM hm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.780
So France is the second largest market in the world for manga

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.260
And this is normal because we French people need to dream

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
And what better to dream than manga?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.940
"One day I would be Hokage! This is my nindo"

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.440
you're allow to cringe

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.140
Well sometimes it sells you dream a little more wicked

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.880
Death Note by example

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.440
Just know the face, first and last name of a person

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.780
to be able to kill them and choose the conditions of their death

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780
Who never tried it on a teacher?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.480
"The French teacher, Mrs FranÃ§oise Lachaise

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.660
die by putting a Victor Hugo book in the ass "

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.680
AAAAAH

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.820
So a classic shonen manga for young people is a hero with super powers too stylish

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.880
a heroine who is in love with the hero

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.600
and the hero who doesn't realize it

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.620
And it gives roughly this:

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.560
"Henri Henri ...

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.380
What?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080
Thank you for protected me from the dragon ...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.500
Yeah but he deserved it this dragon!

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.500
Say, do you think you and I might be a little more than friends ...?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
What? You want to be fighting partners?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.900
This is AWESOME

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.340
"Aaah but why does he never understand !!"

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.240
AH YES ! I forgot to tell you that in manga chicks are all 2F

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.240
Ah manga artists are perverts.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.440
that's why there are hentais

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.600
So for those who do not know eh, a hentai is an erotic film but drawn in manga

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.040
The worst is that the hentai manga which remake mangas which ain't hentai at the base.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760
You imagine what it would make the hentai parody of Naruto?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.980
Kyuubi the 9 tails demon ... Well this is disgusting

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.120
Enough worldliness

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
We will talk about the legendary manga

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.900
The best manga of all time

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.000
I speak of course of Dragon Ball Z

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.380
So already I don't give a a shit about what you think of what you'll say

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.980
Goku is the strongest character of all manga
 (this video was made before the release of One Punch Man)

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.080
He smashes Luffy, he smashes Natsu, he smashes Kyo

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.280
Well Eye Shield, what are you doing here ...

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.440
Nah but come back with a sword at least ...

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.760
I know what you're gonna say:

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
"No, Light is stronger than Goku because he can kill him with his Death Note"

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.000
But not at all, because the Death Note to kill someone, you must know the first name and the last name !!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.480
Are you ever seen a family name in Dragon Ball ?? WELL?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.120
So shut up already Light

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.600
In addition Goku name is not even Son Goku , his true name is Kakarotto

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180
So he already gave you a ka-carrot

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300
JEAN joker! HUMORIST!

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300
I tell you I'm an expert on Dragon Ball

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.740
Here a small question test for Dragon Ball fans who think they know:

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.760
Which character in Dragon Ball has the biggest dick?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.200
Go ahead !

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.800
NO!

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800
Of course this ain't mister popo!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.480
You racist!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.980
This is obviously Boo!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.000
Expects the guy he stretched as he wants there's only Luffy to make him competition

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Besides the girls if you are in love with Luffy,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.540
eh not frankly do not make love with him ...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400
It would make you a chewing cock it would hurt ...

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.520
Well like everyone else I was heartbroken when I saw the film adaptation of Dragon Ball. Dragonball Evolution

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.680
Oh fuck ! If you never saw it frankly do not look at that, it was shit.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.680
They took a white guy to play Goku ...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.520
It is not against the white guys, but I call it raping culture

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520
It's as if you took myself to play Tintin

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.660
I know what you're gonna say:

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.140
"No, Kevin you can not play Tintin because you're Chinese, you would have eaten Snowy."

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.140
ahahahahah

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.860
VERY FUNNY warn me next time you make a joke like that, you almost killed me

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.600
Well I talk to Hollywood now.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.420
Hollywood: the next time you make a film adaptation of Dragon Ball,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.980
Pick me !

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400
Pick me to play Vegeta.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.580
I know what you'll say:

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.900
"Oh no Vegeta it's Henry, it's not you Kevin"

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.680
Well no ! I'm about to show you that I'm the real Vegeta

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680
I'll show you some pictures of me in high school

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.240
But prepare yourself psychologically because after you won't see me the same way!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.600
You will hallucinate before these pictures

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.460
Prepare yourselves !

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.660
Ready? 3, 2, 1

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.060
WHAT THE FUUUUUCK

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.060
.... Well ... That was me in high school

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.680
Without hair gel eh! The haircut it held itself in the air.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.780
When I showed up in class, my physics teacher went crazy.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020
Ah, he reviewed all the theory of gravity

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.020
p = mg or ... what?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.180
It was just to show you how much I love mangas.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.840
DON'T JUDGE ME!

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.420
In short, mangas are great, and if you never read one ...

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.700
Henry: WATCHAAAA

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.640
What are you doing here??

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.020
Itachi I came to kill you !!

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.600
OH NO

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.140
