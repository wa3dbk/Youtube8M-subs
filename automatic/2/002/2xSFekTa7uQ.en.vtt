wasn't<00:02:18.239> joking<00:02:18.510> around<00:02:18.600> with<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.959> 155<00:02:19.770> grain

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
wasn't joking around with this 155 grain

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100 
wasn't joking around with this 155 grain
they<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> thing<00:02:20.520> rated<00:02:20.940> at<00:02:21.060> 1010<00:02:21.840> feet

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
they got this thing rated at 1010 feet

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.199 
they got this thing rated at 1010 feet
per<00:02:22.260> second<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.860> looking<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> way<00:02:24.060> that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
per second and looking at the way that

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.670 
per second and looking at the way that
things<00:02:24.450> mushroom<00:02:24.840> back<00:02:25.020> they<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.320> every<00:02:25.560> bit

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
things mushroom back they got every bit

we get the rapid expansion and look at

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.009 
we get the rapid expansion and look at
that<00:03:02.519> track<00:03:02.820> right<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.690> pretty

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
that track right there that is pretty

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
massive it is dumping denim everywhere I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.470 
massive it is dumping denim everywhere I

and<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.049> tearing<00:03:10.890> big-time<00:03:11.580> as<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.910> goes

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and it is tearing big-time as it goes

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150 
and it is tearing big-time as it goes
through<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:13.140> hollow<00:03:13.440> point<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:13.920> going

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
through there that hollow point is going

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
through there that hollow point is going
through<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> lot<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.730> pressure<00:03:15.269> right<00:03:15.570> there

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
through a lot of pressure right there

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.430 
through a lot of pressure right there
and<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.709> finally<00:03:17.130> starts<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> flatline<00:03:18.440> right

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and it finally starts to flatline right

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.490 
and it finally starts to flatline right
around<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.830> nine<00:03:20.010> inch<00:03:20.310> mark<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:22.080> can<00:03:22.230> see<00:03:22.380> it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
around the nine inch mark you can see it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500 
around the nine inch mark you can see it
flatlines<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.000> goes<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.209> its

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
flatlines and then it goes to its

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.770 
flatlines and then it goes to its
resting<00:03:24.959> spot<00:03:25.320> down<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.130> 13th
