entering the one make CDs this year we

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.659 
entering the one make CDs this year we

and<00:05:00.150> i<00:05:00.270> was<00:05:00.539> feeling<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.110> respect<00:05:01.740> SF<00:05:02.130> we

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
and i was feeling that the respect SF we

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.520 
and i was feeling that the respect SF we
pretty<00:05:03.479> much<00:05:03.570> have<00:05:03.990> everything<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:05.039> seek

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
pretty much have everything that we seek

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.360 
pretty much have everything that we seek
so<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.590> conclude<00:05:08.360> I'll<00:05:09.360> admit<00:05:09.750> that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
so to conclude I'll admit that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.800 
so to conclude I'll admit that
considering<00:05:11.370> how<00:05:11.580> high<00:05:11.909> a<00:05:11.940> bar<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.419> chicks'll

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
considering how high a bar the chicks'll

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.560 
considering how high a bar the chicks'll
had<00:05:12.990> set<00:05:13.289> my<00:05:14.250> expectations<00:05:14.520> from<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.030> SF<00:05:15.419> for

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
had set my expectations from the SF for

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.899 
had set my expectations from the SF for
a<00:05:15.599> lot<00:05:15.810> more<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.620> mean<00:05:17.099> I<00:05:17.220> feel<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.789> could

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
a lot more I mean I feel that it could

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.879 
a lot more I mean I feel that it could
have<00:05:18.030> come<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.449> fuel<00:05:18.780> injection<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.590> more

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
have come with fuel injection and more

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.790 
have come with fuel injection and more
power<00:05:20.630> but<00:05:21.630> there's<00:05:21.810> no<00:05:21.960> denying<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.470> fact

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
power but there's no denying the fact

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.680 
power but there's no denying the fact
that<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.220> SF<00:05:23.639> definitely<00:05:24.180> takes<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.479> game

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
that the SF definitely takes the game

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.680 
that the SF definitely takes the game
forward<00:05:25.260> in<00:05:25.949> terms<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.550> breaking<00:05:26.940> in<00:05:27.330> terms<00:05:27.539> of
