28<00:00:46.489> hdmi<00:00:47.489> converter<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.170> case<00:00:49.410> let's<00:00:49.590> say

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
28 hdmi converter so in case let's say

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.910 
28 hdmi converter so in case let's say
back<00:00:50.520> magic<00:00:50.760> camera<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.590> SD

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
back magic camera you can go out from SD

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630 
back magic camera you can go out from SD
i--<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.930> hdmi<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:55.980> viewfinder

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
i-- and then hdmi in the or viewfinder

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
i-- and then hdmi in the or viewfinder
it<00:00:57.050> comes<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.430> d-type<00:00:59.430> power<00:01:00.059> cable<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it comes with a d-type power cable it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.579 
it comes with a d-type power cable it
which<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:02.699> ends<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.420> for

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
which has like two ends on it one for

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
which has like two ends on it one for
viewfinder<00:01:04.589> 14<00:01:05.220> converters<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.360> cable

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
viewfinder 14 converters one cable

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
viewfinder 14 converters one cable
powers<00:01:06.960> both<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.409> supplies<00:01:07.740> yes<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> then<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
powers both you supplies yes and then it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
powers both you supplies yes and then it
also<00:01:09.540> has<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> built-in<00:01:10.740> 15<00:01:11.520> millimeter<00:01:11.970> rod

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
also has this built-in 15 millimeter rod

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.200 
also has this built-in 15 millimeter rod
clamp<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.110> comes<00:01:13.439> directly<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.670> road

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
clamp that comes directly to the road

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190 
clamp that comes directly to the road
which<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.659> holding<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> EDF<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.200> basically

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
which is holding the EDF and basically

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
which is holding the EDF and basically
therefore<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.880> streamlined

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
therefore you get a really streamlined

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
therefore you get a really streamlined
package<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> its<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.220> compact<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.030> can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
package and its really compact you can

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359 
package and its really compact you can
make<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.869> short<00:01:25.080> nice<00:01:25.470> cables<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
make it really short nice cables for the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
make it really short nice cables for the
SDI<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.420> off<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.259> go<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.360> fixed<00:01:30.360> some

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
SDI and off you go we also fixed some

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.120 
SDI and off you go we also fixed some
issues<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.600> EDF<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:34.470> people<00:01:34.950> we

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
issues with the EDF basically people we

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.450 
issues with the EDF basically people we
enhanced<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.890> wreak<00:01:38.220> lock

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
enhanced it so it now it can wreak lock

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.020 
enhanced it so it now it can wreak lock
it's<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.150> screen<00:01:40.079> refresh<00:01:40.619> rate<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.759> any

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it's a screen refresh rate do they any

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's a screen refresh rate do they any
given<00:01:42.479> frame<00:01:42.840> rate<00:01:43.170> input<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.549> frame<00:01:44.820> rate

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
given frame rate input so any frame rate

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230 
given frame rate input so any frame rate
of<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.329> yeah<00:01:45.570> yeah<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> yeah<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:48.060> say

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
then the cable the cable is not decided

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.810 
then the cable the cable is not decided
yet<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:38.140> will<00:03:38.290> be<00:03:38.470> like<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.860> two<00:03:39.220> weeks<00:03:39.250> but
