00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.349
 Hello everyone 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.470
 I make this video at the request of a 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.779
 user who asked me how to do it 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.960
 best stop the bass drum of the 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.360
 battery which materials to insert as 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.910
 put them away saying I show you how 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.399
 I do it and also because I don't think so 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.930
 that there is a particular technique for 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:45.420
 do this first of all when I go to 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 insert materials inside the case 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.579
 I try to figure out if I want 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.710
 also stop the beating skin ie 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.680
 making the material touch on the skin 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.200
 beating if I want to stop the skin 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.670
 resonant then moving a little more the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.130
 material towards the resonant skin 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.369
 or by putting material without 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.390
 touching no skin or putting on 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.280
 material stopping both skins 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 I don't like to put too much stuff in it 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.729
 inside the bass drum I prefer to do 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.280
 remain that true sound of the bass drum 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.969
 but sometimes we have to 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.459
 stop it so we have one here 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.090
 bass drum of 16 so it is very small 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:33.909
 but the same thing can be done with 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.029
 any type of cash for example 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.939
 on this case that is already small then 

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:41.859
 It does not need to put too much material 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.389
 simply this rubber sheet 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:48.369
 feather that I decided not to touch 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.029
 on the resonant skin because I liked it 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.380
 that sound a little to a long that 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:02:00.130
 bass drum being a little bit small 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.849
 in fact a little bit small if I stopped 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 also the resonant skin then the case 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:10.869
 it would still be too closed in 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.910
 this way I support material on 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.850
 beating leather resting on and going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.700
 create 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.250
 let's say I fill the part of the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.570
 of taste and therefore his will not be a little 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:34.020
 more firm this is the tip the typology 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:40.090
 of position I usually use then 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.220
 we could for example put if we want 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.280
 the most stuck sound put a 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:52.420
 simple pillow always resting on the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.130
 lower part of the case in this 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.290
 so now the case is small 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.890
 if the pillow had been bigger if 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.140
 you would have left a little bit a little 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.450
 better now it is very closed 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.550
 this house here 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.880
 ok we occupy almost all of it 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.020
 all the area of ​​the stem then in 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.790
 this way we stopped the case ok 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.060
 I always make her always touch on 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.560
 beating leather in case we want 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.410
 let the beating skin free then 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.560
 let's move it a bit like this 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.270
 it does not touch either on the resonant or on 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.510
 in the other way it could 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.560
 be put a blanket but simple 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.810
 blanket 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.770
 so this way here is this 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:56.070
 simple pride we put a plaid in 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:59.070
 this way ok you stay very stopped 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.070
 ok 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.810
 so there is no particular technique 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.920
 at least I know to put 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.819
 material inside the bass drum and a 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.090
 advice I can give is to support 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.160
 the material in this way here 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.090
 lay it at the bottom of the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.400
 hunk this way here then if we want 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.070
 stop beating skin like I said 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.840
 first we place it also a little above the 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.960
 leather departures let's slide on that 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.020
 we support it here and if we want to stop 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.270
 also very resonant skin 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.580
 effective then let's make sure that 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.370
 this material also goes to touch 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.370
 on the sounding skin I for example 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:57.630
 on the skin resonating the part that 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:02.940
 look towards the inside of the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:05.340
 usually I put the barrel of apply 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.390
 handkerchiefs of fate in such a way 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:15.050
 this skin will live not too long then 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.780
 I decide how much to make it vibrate 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.300
 applying mutes in quotation marks 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.680
 because they are handkerchiefs or stuff 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.810
 similar 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.510
 more or less large so I put one 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.490
 small skin to live among more 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.060
 if I put on a bigger one the beautiful ones 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.060
 will stop more 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.580
 so I don't like too much to stop the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.470
 resonant skin but a little bit 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.470
 this way the firm 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.290
 so there are no particular techniques 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.860
 as I said and try not to fill 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.170
 too much the bass drum this is in my opinion 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.270
 it is very important because the bass drum 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.970
 however it is also a drum e 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.750
 so he needs his own 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.090
 internal volume to release sound 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.800
 so more volume is more the sound will 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.590
 powerful 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.440
 then regarding the skin 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.100
 flying as we have already seen so many 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.320
 sometimes there are orderly and type telli 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.290
 that of the air hans that I use that has 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.870
 the mute around so we already have 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:32.700
 solved a large part of the problem for 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:34.570
 so what about the queues so that's all 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.070
 very simple video 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.419
 I hope it was helpful 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.620
 especially to the user who has it 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.630
 required 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.620
 thanks for following me and the next one 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.620
 hello video
