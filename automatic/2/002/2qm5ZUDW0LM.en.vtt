as<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.800> bush<00:01:07.160> right<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.930> might<00:01:08.930> decide<00:01:09.620> to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
as a bush right now I might decide to

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.170 
as a bush right now I might decide to
change<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.460> I'm<00:01:10.670> definitely<00:01:10.880> gonna<00:01:11.090> be

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
change that I'm definitely gonna be

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.350

doing<00:01:11.360> some<00:01:11.660> pruning<00:01:11.930> as<00:01:12.800> time<00:01:13.190> goes<00:01:13.700> by<00:01:13.730> here

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
doing some pruning as time goes by here

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.740 
doing some pruning as time goes by here
at<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.020> beginning<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.910> offspring<00:01:16.910> that<00:01:17.600> we're

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
at the beginning of offspring that we're

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.220 
at the beginning of offspring that we're
going<00:01:17.930> into<00:01:19.150> seems<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.600> leaves<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.140> the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
going into seems like the leaves on the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.940 
going into seems like the leaves on the
top<00:01:21.440> really<00:01:22.370> didn't<00:01:22.870> lose<00:01:23.870> they'll<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.650> didn't

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
top really didn't lose they'll it didn't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.940 
top really didn't lose they'll it didn't
fall<00:01:25.130> off<00:01:25.340> there<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:26.390> winter<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.650> that

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
fall off there in the the winter so that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.330 
fall off there in the the winter so that
was<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> good<00:01:28.640> thing<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:32.770> think<00:01:33.770> I'll

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
was a good thing but I think I'll

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.219 
was a good thing but I think I'll
definitely<00:01:34.540> proven<00:01:35.540> away<00:01:35.720> some<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.050> these

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
definitely proven away some of these

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.000 
definitely proven away some of these
these<00:01:36.890> bottom<00:01:37.310> like<00:01:38.150> sucker<00:01:38.740> branches<00:01:39.740> here

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
these bottom like sucker branches here

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.240 
these bottom like sucker branches here
and<00:01:40.759> try<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.390> form<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.990> still<00:01:42.680> keep<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.009> as<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and try to form it still keep it as a

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.719 
and try to form it still keep it as a
bush<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:43.820> try<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.119> form<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:46.580> know<00:01:46.700> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
bush but try to form it you know a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.560 
bush but try to form it you know a
little<00:01:47.000> bit<00:01:47.090> more<00:01:47.800> not<00:01:48.800> as<00:01:49.180> wide<00:01:50.180> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
little bit more not as wide and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.219 
little bit more not as wide and
sprawling<00:01:51.259> which<00:01:51.920> they<00:01:52.100> tend<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:53.229> Department

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
sprawling which they tend to Department

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.080 
sprawling which they tend to Department
might<00:01:54.320> extend<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.770> one<00:01:54.860> who<00:01:55.009> grow<00:01:55.220> like<00:01:55.820> so

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
might extend the one who grow like so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.550 
might extend the one who grow like so
hopefully<00:01:57.050> these<00:01:57.200> new<00:01:57.530> little<00:01:59.560> leaves

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
hopefully these new little leaves

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.130 
hopefully these new little leaves
popping<00:02:01.190> out<00:02:01.369> will<00:02:02.060> mean<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.570> there'll<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.050> a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
popping out will mean that there'll be a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.580 
popping out will mean that there'll be a
lot<00:02:03.200> more<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.710> come<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.160> my<00:02:04.940> pomegranate<00:02:05.930> bush
