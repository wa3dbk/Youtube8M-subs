the<00:01:24.250> first<00:01:24.460> lipstick<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:24.970> want<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.210> show<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.420> is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
the first lipstick I want to show you is

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.560 
the first lipstick I want to show you is
my<00:01:25.720> favorite<00:01:26.050> one<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:27.370> by<00:01:27.550> ood<00:01:27.909> house<00:01:28.120> and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
my favorite one it is by ood house and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.540 
my favorite one it is by ood house and
it's<00:01:28.960> in<00:01:29.200> there<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.860> think<00:01:30.070> it's<00:01:30.250> called<00:01:30.430> like

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
it's in there I think it's called like

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's in there I think it's called like
the<00:01:30.700> jelly<00:01:31.090> lips<00:01:31.570> formula<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
the jelly lips formula and it's in the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.530 
the jelly lips formula and it's in the
shade<00:01:34.210> jpk<00:01:35.050> 0:03<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.520> thus<00:01:36.790> lipstick<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.360> a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
shade jpk 0:03 and thus lipstick is a

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.080 
shade jpk 0:03 and thus lipstick is a
cross<00:01:37.810> between<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.229> lipstick<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:39.010> lip<00:01:39.550> tint<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
cross between a lipstick a lip tint and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.180 
cross between a lipstick a lip tint and
a<00:01:40.210> lip<00:01:40.390> gloss<00:01:40.440> there's<00:01:41.440> just<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.680> lot<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.860> things

as you know your girl loves to rock the
orange<00:01:59.830> lip<00:02:00.130> personally<00:02:00.729> I've<00:02:00.850> always<00:02:00.909> been<00:02:01.150> a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
orange lip personally I've always been a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.730 
orange lip personally I've always been a
fan<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> orange<00:02:01.900> lip<00:02:02.110> because<00:02:02.440> it's<00:02:02.710> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
fan of the orange lip because it's a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.469 
fan of the orange lip because it's a
little<00:02:02.920> less<00:02:03.040> common<00:02:03.310> usually<00:02:04.150> when<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.360> go

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
little less common usually when you go

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.230 
little less common usually when you go
out<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.630> see<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:05.170> red<00:02:05.710> lip<00:02:06.010> or<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.369> hot<00:02:06.760> pink<00:02:07.030> one

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
out you see a red lip or a hot pink one

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.180 
out you see a red lip or a hot pink one
and<00:02:07.510> so<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:07.750> think<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.229> orange<00:02:08.530> deserves<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and so I think the orange deserves a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.550 
and so I think the orange deserves a
little<00:02:09.610> bit<00:02:09.729> more<00:02:09.909> cred<00:02:10.179> my<00:02:10.989> last<00:02:11.170> lip<00:02:11.379> color

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
little bit more cred my last lip color
