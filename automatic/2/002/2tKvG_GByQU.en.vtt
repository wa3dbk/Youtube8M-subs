00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 what are ten words 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.480
 barely a sigh barely anything 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.329
 just a simple phrase an idea 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.050
 just a short breath 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.960
 phonemes and lexemes words that with ink 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.269
 they are gently guided 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.260
 thoughts that are shipwrecked on the shore 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.379
 of your frosty sanz minds 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.310
 one step of the way a dream that does not 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.370
 want to try 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.670
 a written ending that dies before 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.180
 start counting 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 an infinity ends blÃ© a feeling 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.650
 untouchable that this folio imagines 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.130
 10 sentences with 10 words an idea that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.740
 it ends now 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.659
 because I want to be your friend to be your 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.650
 escort your gentleman 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.340
 because you have 10 words left 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 I love you 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 sorry has said no no no 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.310
 importance
