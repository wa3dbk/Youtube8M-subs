00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello very good I'm killing the channel 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:09.160
 beagle mack and today I make this video 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:13.240
 to improve the last video I made 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.639
 with the launcher is worth the last video was 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.880
 for referral to the panda launcher and 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.640
 and I did a little thing for the people who 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.529
 play on mac could play as well 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.840
 you know come on I imagine that if you are in 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.660
 this video is for that it's worth I did it 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.939
 a way that occupies 20 almost 27 gigas and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.470
 it costs quite a bit to download voucher and then 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.390
 I wanted to upload it on other platforms 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.950
 but I do not have gigas 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.630
 I do not have so many gigas to upload it in 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.950
 other platforms and only then could I 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.840
 go up in mega, so it's worth nothing 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.810
 you go to the link here below the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 description and here you will find that 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.960
 I've left a mega link and another link 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.410
 mediafire vale you can download it from 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.090
 those two now because the file just 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.809
 weighs 26 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:06.880
 point 4 mb no gigabytes worth I made a 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.700
 made the other launcher work 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.170
 way and so you download it from another of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.950
 another way that is a little bit faster 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.010
 at least the theme of the mega or 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.690
 mediafire is worth once you download 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.200
 either of these two you download 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.570
 'aces' 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.450
 this file is worth in this zip folder 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.460
 that there is here because none of this is easy 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 you can see the title comments in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.770
 twitter then nothing you go to my twitter and I 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 you comment, that's why I have the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.380
 tweet right host 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 ok you double click and unzip 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.650
 Well, I passed, I gave him many 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.270
 Trash clicks worth 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.600
 it will come out 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.250
 you will get this folder double click on 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 You can throw this folder to yours 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 applications if you want more applications 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 then the epic eyes 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.920
 you have these two folders the only thing 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.980
 you have to do in this folder is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 give you right click to show content on 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.920
 package 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.220
 with temps 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.780
 and in this folder here 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.810
 mac osx it itches and you give it double 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 click vale you will leave this world of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.290
 warcraft is a unics application 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.010
 downloaded from internet sure you want 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.440
 you open it and here the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.660
 terminal as you can see minimizes it and 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 if you want to not bother and here is 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 start downloading voucher 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.720
 I will not wait for it to download 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.610
 because the video is going to be eternal 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.750
 because my connection is very slow it's worth 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.980
 but after that you get 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.600
 automatically the game is worth it happens 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.330
 enter and nothing enter your user 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.640
 normal and current look we are going to 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.319
 do I have it already downloaded too 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.299
 here 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.420
 once you have downloaded everything 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.249
 downloaded enter the launcher if by 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.859
 whatever it is by punching the launcher this 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:08.680
 it does not open directly, there is 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.340
 Sometimes it does not open, let's try 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.340
 to see if it opens 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.910
 we'll see 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.160
 good set open 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.330
 It's good fast so you can see 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.330
 so it works 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.090
 success what does it mean by connecting the 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.190
 first time you do this it takes a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.160
 little takes a little bit because they are 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.050
 generating the folders surely 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.270
 a window comes out that puts 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:45.080
 loading with a process of 91 92 93 94 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.080
 OK 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.380
 when the process comes out that what 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.510
 you leave and then they will connect worth the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.870
 first time you are connected to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.020
 server takes quite the thing is if 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.920
 giving it here you do not open it up no no no 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.870
 launches the launcher here is worth entering 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.330
 you enter again here to show the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.090
 contained the benissa package with temps 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.390
 you come to mac osx and it itches is to this other 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.900
 time 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.000
 double click and here will launch the game 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.639
 vale is a way to force anger 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.790
 so then here 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.790
 OK 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.910
 as you see 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.849
 It works that I do not want to do eternal 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.189
 in the video would be to thank yes 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.610

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
 is not dead male because maybe if 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.000
