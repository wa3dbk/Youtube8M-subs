00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello very good I'm from moxi city and today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.069
 I bring you a video in which I will say it is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 what wwp2 14 should have in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 first place like campaign mode was 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.969
 good that again there is a road tour 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 gazelle men and this way has been since 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.840
 the smart town versus row 2009 until the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.019
 wwdc in 13 was the attitude was that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.720
 recreates the best combats of that time 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.300
 then in 215 is the 30 years of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.219
 Relax the menu and in this way recreate the most 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.010
 great combats of all the rules the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 hobbies we know that both the attitude mode 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 It was like the 30 years of Laser Men since 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 they have combat objectives and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.430
 historical goals that allow you 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.039
 unlock good things by going back to 2 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 cars 15 if there was a raw burgas mode the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.899
 meny the perfect fighters would be 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.719
 100 punk daniel bryan allegri test and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 page and a wrestler created since always 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.469
 they are triple h 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 jones in a triple h jona if there was not 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 road tour gasser men and a successor 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 perfect would be ruthless aggression was 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 Many people wanted this mode in 214 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 as 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.010
 the second best was also would have to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.110
 improve the goal system since 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 whenever there is more than one goal near 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.850
 it is difficult to control who to hit what 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 that it is spectacular and realism 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.160
 the 214 was very complete and more with the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.230
 editor what I liked was what to put 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.090
 the face of a real fighter to one created 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.760
 as well as putting the body with the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.710
 tattoos and all that allows you to create 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.110
 a 100 punk with long hair makes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 years for putting an example also 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 it would be good to eliminate the dlc and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.740
 that they put a way to update the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
 roster since in the tlc there is always 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 pay in addition to always want a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.530
 fighter who is not what he does 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 resort to the cau the system of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.190
 roster update that I say is the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.950
 of the fifa for consoles of the two 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.140
 last generations for example every 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 week would be updated manually 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.550
 roster as well as put a mode of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.800
 news update them or see when having 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.110
 the last fighters that there is something that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 would see impossible or update the look 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 already useful for superstars for example 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.560
 if a fighter changes his atyra he 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 lets beard have another haircut 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.770
 that we could have it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.020
 also that at least he had 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.630
 update to correct errors that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.250
 in every delivery there is also I think it is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.560
 the time they let them be in a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.540
 ring more than six fighters I mean 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 to the royal rumble although that too 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
 allowed to have combats like 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.720
 classic fight eliminations by 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.060
 teams of survivor series also 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.130
 it would improve the double and bradl universe 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.770
 have more spaces of rivalries 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.380
 since in 214 you can only put 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.260
 three rivalries by good brand me 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.180
