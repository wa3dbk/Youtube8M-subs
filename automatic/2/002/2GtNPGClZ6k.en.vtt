foam<00:01:15.369> here<00:01:15.670> I'll<00:01:16.270> be<00:01:16.420> putting<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.869> backer<00:01:17.409> piece

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
foam here I'll be putting a backer piece

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.950 
foam here I'll be putting a backer piece
on<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.189> since<00:01:18.729> it'll<00:01:18.939> be<00:01:19.060> budding<00:01:19.600> up<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
edge of the table so you might be able

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.350 
edge of the table so you might be able
to<00:01:22.270> see<00:01:22.509> any<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:27.360> pretty

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.660 
out the filler if you have a chance to
pick<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.069> up<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.400> think<00:04:06.609> it's<00:04:06.730> around<00:04:08.310> $5<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> can

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
pick it up I think it's around $5 a can

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.310 
pick it up I think it's around $5 a can
but<00:04:10.510> it's<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.660> really<00:04:10.810> large<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.470> and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
but it's a really large can and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.830 
but it's a really large can and
I've<00:04:13.320> been<00:04:13.530> able<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.830> do<00:04:14.090> two<00:04:15.090> big<00:04:15.300> projects

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
I've been able to do two big projects

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.150 
I've been able to do two big projects
and<00:04:16.020> I<00:04:16.080> still<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.410> about<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.680> quarter<00:04:16.890> that

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and I still have about a quarter that

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.410 
and I still have about a quarter that
can't<00:04:17.340> lift<00:04:17.610> so<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.840> definitely<00:04:19.140> good<00:04:19.320> stuff

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
can't lift so it's definitely good stuff

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.610 
can't lift so it's definitely good stuff
