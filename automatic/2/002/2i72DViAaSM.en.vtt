outside<00:00:29.020> of<00:00:29.680> your<00:00:29.890> loom<00:00:30.239> and<00:00:32.130> place<00:00:33.130> it<00:00:33.370> above

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
outside of your loom and place it above

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.160 
outside of your loom and place it above
the<00:00:33.880> loop<00:00:34.300> that's<00:00:34.660> on<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.200> loom<00:00:36.930> pick<00:00:37.930> up<00:00:38.140> that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
the loop that's on the loom pick up that

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.620 
the loop that's on the loom pick up that
loop

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.479 

and<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:42.620> over

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.890 

again<00:00:46.989> place<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.670> yarn<00:00:49.940> above<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.720> loop

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
again place the the yarn above the loop

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.770 
again place the the yarn above the loop
that's<00:00:51.170> already<00:00:51.500> there<00:00:52.059> pick<00:00:53.059> up<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.420> bottom

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
that's already there pick up the bottom

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.010 
that's already there pick up the bottom
loop<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.570> knit<00:00:56.570> over

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.460 

it<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.410> most<00:01:02.620> simple<00:01:03.250> of<00:01:03.370> all<00:01:03.850> stitches

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
it is the most simple of all stitches

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.790 
it is the most simple of all stitches
however<00:01:05.970> there<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.120> one<00:01:07.150> danger<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.990> this<00:01:08.170> it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
however there is one danger to this it

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.630 
however there is one danger to this it
is<00:01:09.430> ever<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.480> easy<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:12.400> knit<00:01:12.670> too<00:01:12.940> tight<00:01:14.640> using

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
is ever so easy to knit too tight using

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.450 
is ever so easy to knit too tight using
this<00:01:15.820> stitch<00:01:17.760> so<00:01:18.760> let's<00:01:19.000> finish<00:01:19.300> this<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:21.250> go

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460

back and I will give a few tips to keep

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.840 
back and I will give a few tips to keep
it<00:01:24.880> loose<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:27.729> finish<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.450> row<00:01:29.430> look<00:01:30.430> one

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
it loose so we finish the row look one

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.000 
it loose so we finish the row look one
more<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:33.070> finish<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> row<00:01:33.760> now<00:01:34.800> going<00:01:35.800> back

more we finish the row now going back
it's<00:01:36.850> simple<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:38.080> yarn<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.560> already<00:01:38.860> on<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
it's simple the yarn is already on the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
more and more as unit there is a little

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.870 
more and more as unit there is a little
thing<00:02:06.910> that's<00:02:07.119> called<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.080> wrap<00:02:08.880> which

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
thing that's called to you wrap which

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
thing that's called to you wrap which
means<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.750> whine<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.819> yarn<00:02:13.120> around<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
means you whine this the yarn around the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.520 
means you whine this the yarn around the
peg<00:02:14.200> notice<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.520> ear<00:02:15.670> app<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.600> from<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
peg notice in the ear app but from the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.080 
peg notice in the ear app but from the
outside<00:02:18.150> towards<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> inside<00:02:23.850> wrap<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:25.060> like

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
outside towards the inside wrap it like

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.470 
outside towards the inside wrap it like
that<00:02:25.510> then<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:26.650> over<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:30.360> bring<00:02:31.360> it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
that then it over and then bring it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.309 
that then it over and then bring it
towards<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.050> next<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:33.270> peg<00:02:34.270> without<00:02:34.990> pulling

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
towards the next a peg without pulling

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.240 
towards the next a peg without pulling
as<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.459> can<00:02:36.640> see<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.540> creates<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.530> tiny

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
as you can see this creates a tiny

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.300 
as you can see this creates a tiny
little<00:02:39.550> loop<00:02:40.000> over<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.110> that's<00:02:41.860> why<00:02:42.130> they

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
little loop over you that's why they

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.809 
little loop over you that's why they
call<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.030> wrap<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.780> ensures<00:02:44.020> that

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
call it the you wrap and it ensures that

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.600 
call it the you wrap and it ensures that
you<00:02:46.319> keep<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.620> recluse<00:02:48.100> enough<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.150> again

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
you keep the recluse enough so again

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.670 
you keep the recluse enough so again
wine<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.090> thread<00:02:52.390> round<00:02:52.780> peg<00:02:53.170> from<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
wine the thread round peg from the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.559 
wine the thread round peg from the
outside<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> over<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.310> create<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.300> little

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
outside and it over and create a little

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.089 
outside and it over and create a little
loop<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.170> way<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.080> may<00:03:02.830> have<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
loop that way so you may have to

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.030 
loop that way so you may have to
experiment<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.150> little<00:03:04.300> bit<00:03:04.510> if<00:03:05.349> you<00:03:05.650> have<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
experiment a little bit if you have the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.340 
experiment a little bit if you have the
discipline<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> keep<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.720> loose<00:03:07.960> like<00:03:08.760> just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
discipline to keep it loose like just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:20.290 
discipline to keep it loose like just
knitting<00:03:11.350> from<00:03:12.130> from<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> front<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:15.280> this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.900 

or<00:03:20.600> if<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.290> prefer<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.100> rap<00:03:22.370> it's<00:03:22.640> up<00:03:22.880> to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
or if you prefer the you rap it's up to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.310 
or if you prefer the you rap it's up to
you<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:26.150> they're<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.860> different<00:03:27.860> methods

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
you but they're just different methods

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:39.270 
you but they're just different methods
to<00:03:30.320> create<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.950> knit<00:03:31.130> stitch

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.340
