00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
hey guys this is Rafe this is a the some

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.270 
hey guys this is Rafe this is a the some
of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.240> training<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.440> week<00:00:07.620> one<00:00:07.859> lesson

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
of the training for the week one lesson

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.270 
of the training for the week one lesson
so<00:00:09.059> basically<00:00:09.660> how<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.139> works<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:11.099> have

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
so basically how this works is you have

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.200 
so basically how this works is you have
to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.550> by<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> piano<00:00:12.590> I<00:00:13.590> will<00:00:14.099> name<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.240> chord<00:00:15.660> and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
to be by a piano I will name a chord and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.880 
to be by a piano I will name a chord and
you<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.930> either<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.410> c<00:00:19.710> f

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you have to it's either going to be c f

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
you have to it's either going to be c f
4g<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.210> week<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.470> only

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
4g it's just the first week on the only

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
4g it's just the first week on the only
chords<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.130> I've<00:00:23.279> taught<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.640> far<00:00:23.820> CF<00:00:24.150> 4g<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
chords that I've taught so far CF 4g so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.689 
chords that I've taught so far CF 4g so
I'll<00:00:24.689> name<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> cord<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:26.039> try<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.519> play

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I'll name the cord you try and play

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
I'll name the cord you try and play
you'll<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.330> six<00:00:28.050> seconds<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:29.099> whatever

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you'll have like six seconds or whatever

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.830 
you'll have like six seconds or whatever
and<00:00:29.670> then<00:00:29.820> I'll<00:00:29.970> play<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> then<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> can

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and then I'll play it and then you can

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.620 
and then I'll play it and then you can
see<00:00:30.990> how<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> okay<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> hopefully<00:00:33.270> this
