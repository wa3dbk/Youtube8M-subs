numbers a lack of um people out there uh

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.620 
numbers a lack of um people out there uh
it<00:06:09.900> creates<00:06:10.320> this<00:06:10.470> situation<00:06:11.220> where<00:06:11.880> you<00:06:12.510> know

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
it creates this situation where you know
