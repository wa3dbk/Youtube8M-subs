00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I remember because I originally kind of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.980 
I remember because I originally kind of
32<00:01:08.380> pieces<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.979> can<00:01:09.189> that<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.540> wanted

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
32 pieces I can that I because I wanted

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.859 
32 pieces I can that I because I wanted
to<00:01:11.140> transform<00:01:11.650> at<00:01:11.860> first<00:01:12.159> I<00:01:12.490> glued<00:01:13.299> them<00:01:13.479> here

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
to transform at first I glued them here

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.950 
to transform at first I glued them here
so<00:01:14.049> be<00:01:14.530> spherical<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.210> saw<00:01:16.509> this<00:01:16.750> big

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so be spherical but I saw this big

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.760 
so be spherical but I saw this big
dangly<00:01:17.409> piece<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:20.409> think<00:01:20.500> care

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
dangly piece so I really think care

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.420 
dangly piece so I really think care
about<00:01:20.979> transforming<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.140> just<00:01:24.009> go<00:01:24.220> read

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
about transforming so I just go read

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.429 
about transforming so I just go read
that<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.939> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.119> he<00:01:28.960> still<00:01:29.229> has<00:01:29.409> a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
touch by doing it on the that I think

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.090

that's<00:02:15.370> best<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.880> can<00:02:16.000> see<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
that's best way you can see it on the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.350 
that's best way you can see it on the
joints<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.340> fingers<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.890> then<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
joints on the fingers and then there's a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440 
joints on the fingers and then there's a
lot<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.600> red<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:24.010> brown<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.610> cover<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.210> brown

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the red make those arms and legs up and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.620 
the red make those arms and legs up and
silver<00:02:35.610> okay<00:02:38.580> that's<00:02:39.580> really<00:02:40.030> all<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.209> really

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
silver okay that's really all I really

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
silver okay that's really all I really
did<00:02:40.990> with<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:45.630> didn't<00:02:46.630> oh<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.790> changed

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
did with it I didn't oh and I changed

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.430

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
that this same color was on his waist

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.750 
that this same color was on his waist
here<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:55.990> painted<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.680> gold<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.370> think<00:02:57.700> that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
here so I painted that gold I think that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.320 
here so I painted that gold I think that
makes<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.120> lot<00:02:58.660> nicer<00:02:59.610> and

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
makes a lot nicer and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.400 
makes a lot nicer and
there's<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:04.180> crest<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.420> said<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:05.990> black

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
there's this crest on said it's black

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.940 
there's this crest on said it's black
with<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.800> gold<00:03:07.130> outline<00:03:07.490> I<00:03:07.730> pretty<00:03:08.360> much<00:03:08.450> based

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
with a gold outline I pretty much based

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.490 
with a gold outline I pretty much based
my<00:03:09.950> designs<00:03:10.460> or<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.210> pain<00:03:11.510> applications<00:03:12.230> when

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
my designs or my pain applications when

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:22.710 
my designs or my pain applications when
his<00:03:12.620> figure<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.430> following<00:03:14.180> images

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.210 

but<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.650> was<00:03:24.800> kind<00:03:25.069> of<00:03:25.130> hard<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.730> that

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
but it was kind of hard to do that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.210 
but it was kind of hard to do that
because<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.260> blacky<00:03:30.260> style<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.830> figure

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
because of the blacky style this figure

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.510 
because of the blacky style this figure
what<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:31.670> then<00:03:31.819> having<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.540> complex<00:03:33.520> images

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
what and then having that complex images

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.470 
what and then having that complex images
I<00:03:34.670> was<00:03:34.790> basing<00:03:35.180> upon<00:03:35.770> but<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.120> called
