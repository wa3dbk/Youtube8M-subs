00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
on and once it's fully inflated I tend

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.180 
on and once it's fully inflated I tend
to<00:03:18.190> close<00:03:18.520> one<00:03:18.910> side<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:20.530> pump<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.040> little

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to close one side and to pump a little

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.260 
to close one side and to pump a little
more<00:03:21.490> air<00:03:21.790> into<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.390> but<00:03:23.200> I'm<00:03:23.320> gonna<00:03:23.440> let<00:03:23.800> it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
more air into it but I'm gonna let it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.340 
more air into it but I'm gonna let it
stand<00:03:25.270> usually<00:03:25.840> at<00:03:25.960> least<00:03:27.780> five<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.110> eight

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
stand usually at least five to eight

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:41.220 
stand usually at least five to eight
minutes<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:30.580> fully<00:03:35.190> expand<00:03:38.760> once<00:03:39.760> once<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.630> give

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
minutes to fully expand once once I give

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.200 
minutes to fully expand once once I give
it<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.410> few<00:03:42.450> with<00:03:43.450> his<00:03:43.660> wisps<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.560> air<00:03:45.130> in<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.910> I

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
it a few with his wisps of air in it I

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.080 
it a few with his wisps of air in it I
just<00:03:46.930> close<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.530> up<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:49.350> that's<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.910> to

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
just close it up and that's it I have to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.210 
just close it up and that's it I have to
say<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.780> really<00:03:53.200> does<00:03:53.590> make<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> big

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
say that it really does make a big

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.770 
say that it really does make a big
difference<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.390> comfortable

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
difference and it is really comfortable

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.100 
difference and it is really comfortable
to<00:03:59.230> sleep<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.800> as<00:04:00.450> opposed<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> sleeping<00:04:02.020> on

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
to sleep on as opposed to sleeping on

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.100 
to sleep on as opposed to sleeping on
the<00:04:02.230> ground<00:04:05.640> now<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.270> thickness<00:04:07.750> you

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
the ground now this is the thickness you

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.510 
the ground now this is the thickness you
can<00:04:08.170> see<00:04:08.940> we<00:04:09.940> definitely<00:04:10.420> have<00:04:11.160> two<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.400> a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
can see we definitely have two and a

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.860 
can see we definitely have two and a
half<00:04:12.730> inches<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:17.680> way<00:04:17.920> you<00:04:18.359> fold<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.570> back

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
half inches and the way you fold it back

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.740 
half inches and the way you fold it back
up<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:22.000> by<00:04:22.900> opening<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.680> two<00:04:23.920> valves<00:04:26.130> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
up is by opening the two valves and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:36.189 
up is by opening the two valves and
starting<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:29.050> fold<00:04:29.560> from<00:04:29.920> this<00:04:30.160> direction

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.549 

just<00:04:37.199> like<00:04:37.380> this

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:39.559 
just like this

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:45.369 
just like this
basically<00:04:40.429> this<00:04:40.819> will<00:04:42.879> cause<00:04:43.879> all<00:04:44.299> the<00:04:44.509> air<00:04:44.659> to

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
basically this will cause all the air to

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.559 
basically this will cause all the air to
deflate<00:04:47.139> though<00:04:48.609> because<00:04:49.609> the<00:04:49.909> straps<00:04:50.299> are

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
deflate though because the straps are

00:04:50.569 --> 00:05:14.960 
deflate though because the straps are
this<00:04:50.839> way<00:04:51.109> I<00:04:51.529> tend<00:04:52.069> to

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.290 

and<00:05:15.630> it's<00:05:15.750> really<00:05:15.930> easy<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.940> default<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.150> only

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
and it's really easy to default it only

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:28.129 
and it's really easy to default it only
takes<00:05:18.690> about

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.339 

admitted<00:05:28.949> herself<00:05:30.439> you<00:05:31.439> know<00:05:31.470> just<00:05:33.169> make<00:05:34.169> sure

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
admitted herself you know just make sure

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:42.020 
admitted herself you know just make sure
you<00:05:34.470> take<00:05:34.650> your<00:05:34.830> time<00:05:40.129> as<00:05:41.129> you<00:05:41.280> can<00:05:41.430> hear<00:05:41.819> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
you take your time as you can hear the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:59.520 
you take your time as you can hear the
air<00:05:42.629> is<00:05:42.810> coming<00:05:43.050> out

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:08.040 

once<00:06:00.530> once<00:06:01.280> you<00:06:01.430> get<00:06:01.610> hold<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.180> air<00:06:02.330> out

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:18.700 

just<00:06:09.050> close<00:06:09.379> the<00:06:09.409> brass<00:06:09.800> fittings<00:06:17.710> close

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
just close the brass fittings close

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.670 
just close the brass fittings close
these<00:06:19.039> ones<00:06:19.340> up<00:06:20.409> and<00:06:21.409> it<00:06:21.650> will<00:06:21.800> stay<00:06:22.250> in<00:06:22.430> shape

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
these ones up and it will stay in shape

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:45.010 
these ones up and it will stay in shape
so<00:06:24.680> now<00:06:24.860> I'm<00:06:25.099> going<00:06:25.370> to<00:06:25.789> move<00:06:26.689> the<00:06:26.900> strap

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.710

one defect that I have to note here is

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.560 
one defect that I have to note here is
that<00:06:49.410> this<00:06:49.919> trap<00:06:50.280> was<00:06:50.610> not<00:06:55.100> sealed<00:06:56.100> right<00:06:56.570> so

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570
