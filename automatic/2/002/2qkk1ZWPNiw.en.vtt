00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.590
 we meet here with our friends 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.330
 the lime carts 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.370
 good guys we are here in a war 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.869
 which is called shocks with the 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.970
 golf carts or something like that have already been 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.970
 Cured the truth a lot 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.950
 we are here as we are here then to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 be well I want to win you know I do not know 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.739
 if you understand me and if it was not for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 Look, it will not matter, but since I'm in the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.760
 race I want to win it normal man not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.720
 I mean 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 after being both teresa cow goes to 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.550
 happen let's give it a shot to see if 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.790
 we get to win voucher for now I do not know 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.739
 exactly very well what would you try to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.199
 It's worth, it 's like a come and go, 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.400
 we can confirm I think so 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350
 we could confirm that it's like a go and 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.850
 come 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.969
 it's like a come and go and ticos is accepted 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.059
 to come and go as the name suggests and 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.059
 now you can come more 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.110
 unfortunate that in Asia since that guy 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.899
 of a real person who took it and I 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.979
 that a propulsion weapon was made and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.270
 he shot in the mouth to make him leave 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.440
 to the planet Mars and Jupiter and not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.910
 will return more alba of not having natives 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.110
 we all know that if I had had 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.110
 the same situation 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 for example 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.440
 he gave her a lollipop 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.880
 we are a little over and we will see 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.930
 if we manage to win because we have 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.520
 stayed second and I want us to do 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 a race which is called by the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.570
 force 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.740
 so you have to win by force and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.290
 well I took the car less appropriate 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.560
 to make America's strength against 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.080
 copete this and as I say, I do not think so 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.250
 this car won him a studied one 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 mustang almost half in your environment 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.250
 zenÃ³n gives an account but good if 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.330
 we will try guys are two laps and I 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.550
 point of control each one so we have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.550
 time let's see why here is not 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.160
 all the force and also intervenes the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.860
 sheath 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 curve more or less well done and executed 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.190
 led me to improve skidding but good 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.209
 it's fine it's been pretty at least 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:46.840
 come here guys everyone will be the 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:48.910
 man without touching them but his father 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.900
 guess the overtaking but of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.900
 stratospheric way atheist 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.709
 indicated the thing above with the spoiler 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.090
 it's weird guys you like stem the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.709
 friend is going to give us warmth is honestly 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:08.019
 I do not know why but I also that light 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:09.580
 impression the truth would be great for 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.260
 see if I can overtake this man 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 has calories to the rock without rubbing I do not know 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.540
 what's up no no no no no go guys is going to 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.370
 see we have the first one ahead we're going 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.350
 to see if we somehow get 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.000
 catch him 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.100
 you would have to put a lot of cane if 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.780
 we want to catch sir that this car 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.380
 It gives a little bit of grief it's very tiny 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.870
 unfortunate but his thing also has what 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.320
 yours will no longer believe you that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.320
 be small 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
 goodbye eye goodbye 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.460
 first full turn let's see if 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.740
 we look at the first one now said that my 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.570
 mother helps me first all career me 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.370
 molarÃ­a snatch the position and 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.840
 teach it to whoever sends because 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.820
 obviously the uncle to first of his of 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.710
 pure luck of all we know that the one that 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.270
 should go first in this case and others 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.970
 Terrorism is clearer than water 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.280
 there is god there is god there is god is not right 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.780
 this income because I think even more 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.170
 the thing I think there we gained time that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.170
 insurance 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.239
 near 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.370
 we will see that the guys hit something 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.569
 the truth as not sticking complicates 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.560
 catch this car like skidding 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.699
 too much really I really do not know 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.109
 why but I feel that the 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.790
 guys pretty little by little but what 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.480
 I'm stepping 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.780
 moving away from checkpoints guys 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.890
 be cool much the bell gave 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.320
 very much but I gave for little but 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.340
 joe the curse of the second good 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.350
 wait because you see that there was no 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.590
 there was little starts to be a little 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.590
 relative 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.490
 and the traffic light two control dots 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.020
 all only two escape me and I 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 but because eye lame 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:03.020
 tortoiseshell no no no no no no no no no 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.599
 fuck shit 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:14.289
 certain tillo shit big fuck besides 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.749
 uncle looks next to macho a bull that without and 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.099
 now I could see the repeat uncle not what 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:21.009
 we had there to see is that the last 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.909
 curve I already believe that I would win but it 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.009
 has put an income because I think that 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.959
 I was marking session and has slowed and 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.369
 has committed a traffic light and we 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.929
 we have also tried the fast because 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.309
 already our last hope and in the end 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.659
 when we go we hit two and once 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.249
 that we stick the two of these there 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.029
 intervenes the luck that we have luck 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.029
 because he 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.719
 and
