00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
of human beings and it is the ocean that

of human beings and it is the ocean that
is<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.509> true<00:01:37.750> highway<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.770> human<00:01:39.220> footprint

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
is the true highway the human footprint

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.100 
is the true highway the human footprint
is<00:01:39.940> bigger<00:01:40.360> than<00:01:40.630> ever

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
is bigger than ever

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
over fished and overheated every day we

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.889

see the impact of humankind on the earth

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.320 
see the impact of humankind on the earth
but<00:01:50.619> what<00:01:50.830> I've<00:01:50.950> discovered<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:52.030> we're

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
but what I've discovered is that we're

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.570 
but what I've discovered is that we're
also<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.869> ones<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:53.410> protect<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.950> may<00:01:54.520> be

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
also the ones that can protect it may be

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.830 
also the ones that can protect it may be
the<00:01:54.759> source<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.149> lot<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.479> problems<00:01:55.750> will

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the source of a lot of the problems will

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.029 
the source of a lot of the problems will
also<00:01:56.110> be<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.289> solution<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.679> some<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
also be the solution to some of the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.040 
also be the solution to some of the
problems<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.700> past<00:01:57.910> is<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.240> past<00:01:58.270> no<00:01:58.750> need<00:01:58.929> to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
problems the past is the past no need to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.240 
problems the past is the past no need to
put<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.319> in<00:01:59.440> front<00:01:59.649> because<00:01:59.830> then<00:02:00.069> you're<00:02:00.220> just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
put it in front because then you're just

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.800 
put it in front because then you're just
stepping<00:02:00.640> your<00:02:00.850> own<00:02:01.000> way<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.330> nothing<00:02:01.630> gets

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
stepping your own way and nothing gets
