00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
you know Cecil never just it gets a lot

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.000 
you know Cecil never just it gets a lot
of<00:02:17.690> publicity<00:02:18.690> about<00:02:19.050> maybe<00:02:19.680> being<00:02:19.890> an

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
of publicity about maybe being an

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.080 
of publicity about maybe being an
alternative<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.580> has<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> lot<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.910> good

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
alternative it has a lot of good

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.300 
alternative it has a lot of good
minerals<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.540> lot<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.750> selenium<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.800> issue

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
minerals a lot of selenium the issue

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.950 
minerals a lot of selenium the issue
with<00:02:23.610> salt<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.600> sodium

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
with salt is in is the sodium

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.870 
with salt is in is the sodium
concentration<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.740> even<00:02:26.010> though<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.760> an

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
concentration so even though it's an

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
concentration so even though it's an
alternative<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.510> still<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> be

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
alternative it's still we have to be

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.450 
alternative it's still we have to be
careful<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.740> our<00:02:28.860> sodium<00:02:29.160> intake

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
careful of our sodium intake

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.490 
careful of our sodium intake
particularly<00:02:29.940> our<00:02:30.060> heart<00:02:30.330> patients<00:02:30.810> or<00:02:30.900> heart

particularly our heart patients or heart

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.860 
particularly our heart patients or heart
failure<00:02:31.560> patients<00:02:32.250> no<00:02:32.400> matter<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:33.690> need

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
failure patients no matter what we need

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.450 
failure patients no matter what we need
to<00:02:33.960> limit<00:02:34.440> their<00:02:34.680> sodium<00:02:34.920> intake<00:02:35.370> because

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
to limit their sodium intake because

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.280 
to limit their sodium intake because
that's<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:36.090> draws<00:02:36.300> water<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.050> gets<00:02:37.170> our

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that's what draws water in and gets our

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
that's what draws water in and gets our
patients<00:02:37.680> into<00:02:37.860> problems<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:39.690> just
