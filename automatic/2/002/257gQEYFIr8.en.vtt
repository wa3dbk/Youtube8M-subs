00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 What started eight years ago with 70 starters 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.010
 started to evolve into one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.889
 real classic that all king rats 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 mountain in aigen mountain last year 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 still shining sunshine this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 year a ride into the gray for the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.029
 athlete is good for the spectators 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
 not so good but I think a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
 gospel concert fits that old king 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.210
 is not a normal bike race actually 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.160
 or it can have everything is one of the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.869
 shortest but today with a lot 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 many categories of children run the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 Free states to seven drivers where the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 world class is starting with christian 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 Hoffmann and then the whole elite so 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.510
 peak in Austria and thus in the road bike 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.670
 the broad masses and the weapons at the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 skirollers was cross-country olympic champion 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.020
 Christian Hoffmann at the start 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.300
 his doping barrier was up by six 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 two years reduced what to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 speculation about a possible 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.510
 comeback led the court high ash 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.510
 can not do anything about it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.400
 and how do you rate your chances for 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.890
 Today one come and say so to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.260
 very busy today is a very busy 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.570
 high the freaks runners at the start 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 and it is very easy 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 make rise very much to 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.829
 Double - stick screen prohibit the safe 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.119
 appreciate very well and as strong 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.280
 obviously not strong enough to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.729
 christian hoffmann caught up with a time 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.689
 equal to 18 minutes and 23 seconds 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.689
 a new track record 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.150
 but not only the long-running tormented 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.580
 Get involved with your own mountains 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.650
 also numerous cycling pros something with more 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 luck clear favorites 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.600
 Riccardo Zoidl and teammate Markus 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.780
 eibegger every country with a very good one 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.980
 team against ricardo counter 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.450
 and there are certainly good chances 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.830
 that you win today if you can 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.660
 actually looked at very well 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.980
 everything is actually very much 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.110
 We would like to go through a difficult mountain 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.120
 barely and she turns that way yes 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.180
 because you can win one of us 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.670
 said done with the license riders took 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.580
 riccardo zoidl the victory and put with 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.230
 eleven minutes and 54 seconds, too 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 set a new track record 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.190
 and then it went on strike at impact 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.970
 The amateurs won Klaus Stein Keller 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.360
 from tyrol 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.310
 you are officially a king 2012 now 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.989
 He wanted to hear something with luck 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.650
 clinic and map of all glaciers 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.810
 circle as well as nano in training especially 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.360
 The weapons cyclists had a hard time 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.860
 in lederhosen, they only fight with each other 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.200
 three steps up the mountain 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.200
 up to 30 kilos weighs a wheel 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.099
 that's something else it's damned 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.540
 strong but it is not as dogged as 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.420
 my bike or mountain bike 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.659
 it makes fun with disgraceful conduct of this 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.889
 is strong but rather uncomfortable was too 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.280
 his appearance here 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.469
 it's time to breathe deeply or that 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.750
 I had enough money when he was with me 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.450
 my page follows when just minutes 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.030
 slower than with a mountain bike 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.489
 Man came by bike driving fast like 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.959
 you come with such a wheel in the right of way 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.180
 as difficult as you have from folkstedt 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.319
 it was only from the position that has 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:49.079
 makes it almost circus the factory 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.750
 Cycling on the Eisenberger a strong 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.620
 outfits tight wadln and two 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.889
 new track records of a king 2012 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.889
 an uplift of a different kind 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.230
 ford has
