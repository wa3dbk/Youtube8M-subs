 U

 U 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.660
 wer 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 U 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.280
 U

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:59.229
 The new Latitude was launched in Nikon d3200 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:04.330
 I think you will like it as a new design and more basic gift. 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:10.390
 Let's see what we have to look at. 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:15.850
 Let's also check out the wu again 1a that was released together. 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 The d3200 was the first to be deployed in 2004 with 116 million lake sensors 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 Mounted 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:28.869
 Among the products with similar pixels is the d3x of the best model of the ICON. 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.979
 Can say that the degree of expression of the orphan soramyeon very good as bogeupgi 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.950
 I'll stay. 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:39.549
 In addition, iso sensitivity while also sensitizing delivered from the base 100 up to 4 times Yoochun 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:45.929
 There are 11,800 extensions 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.929
 I suppose you can say that the picture quality at 9 sensitivity has improved greatly. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:57.110
 Oh, when you club images, the original file is so large, 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.720
 Can be used without being greatly affected by size 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:07.880
 Among the best flags are xp d3, an image processing engine like Pico 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.830
 I'm using it because it's faster in 2004 with 116 million imaginary 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.580
 It allows me to reason. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:21.709
 Vivid colors limit the natural sense of depth and express richer seasons 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:28.270
 In addition, X-Fi writing has improved the 9 sensitivity processing capability. 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.270
 d3100 occurs less than a 0.3 star Will 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:39.890
 If the nuclides are greatly upgraded from 230,000 pixels to 920,000 pixels, 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.710
 I made a clear and pleasant shot. 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.610
 Nowadays, because we shoot a lot in La State 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:53.210
 An external microphone was added to the external expansion terminal 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 When taking a picture, such as a circle again, Amy 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:04.390
 Store microphone allows better quality voice recording 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.390
 In particular, it is free from the driving noise of the lens 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.560
 In the meantime, when you shoot a movie in dslr, the lens moves 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.560
 I wrote it with Malikum. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.590
 The red recording next to the shutter button, like the recent d4 or d800 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 With the addition of buttons, you can shoot much more conveniently 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 U 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.530
 Oh, also on the back 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:42.830
 When the release mode button is added, the shooting mode t f type remote control shooting 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.830
 The ability to operate the functions more quickly 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.690
 Unfortunately I could not use the remote on the d3100. 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:00.580
 In the d3200 , put the remote control sensor back and forth 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:06.270
 I made it for cf shooting or close-up shooting 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.270
 You can use the released mls remote control 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.170
 on 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.170
 U 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:28.530
 Live View with Scene Auto setting when shooting a problem to release the setting to Auto Cod 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:31.950
 The camera will take care to find and switch the setting value for the scene 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.660
 How to use the dslr camera which was somewhat difficult 2 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.660
 One will feel easy. 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:49.909
 The d3100 3200 by Dawn felt a little calcium to 3 frames per second 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:53.560
 Quick as a much faster rate because 10 now supports trim for second 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.560
 The group behind the cross the moment 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.969

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.969

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.360
 Thank you. 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.930
