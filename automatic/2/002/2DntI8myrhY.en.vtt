00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 for those who do not know how to introduce the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.269
 code m2 here will teach you how to be able 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.719
 Introduce 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.029
 first it will disappear above its 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.550
 sim card is not valid since it does not 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.509
 recognizes the step you must follow first 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.619
 that nothing is going to networks deactivate 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.619
 all networks 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.570
 we deactivate the networks 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.670
 all this anger is already once in that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.670
 I was then more options 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.809
 to advanced options 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.820
 SIM card 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.080
 ok here will appear 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.760
 this inhibits some people appreciate 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 some is not not very necessary second 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.740
 will give for those who have blackberry 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.930
 storm 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.670
 212 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.810
 have to actions 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.540
 and show keyboard ok for those who have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.210
 keyboard as the procedure continues 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.330
 that did not move conventional is written 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 They have to flip the keyboard for 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.990
 having all because if not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.590
 may 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.590
 you have to put the uppercase keyboard 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 m 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.790
 d 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.409
 okay 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.780
 if you look at God 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.219
 they came out higher and came out more 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.350
 options and thus displace you 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.119
 then they will give options 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.220
 again show keyboard and problems that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 they are not all because they do not put it they write 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.209
 again with capital letters 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.859
 m 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.010
 to the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.400
 two 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 good since the cell phone is already released 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 he did not proceed to activate the number 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.930
 after going you will leave a window 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.980
 to be able to activate 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.040
 so they can enter the mp 2 that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.240
 is the one that releases the blackberry once 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.730
 done that 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.730
 activate the mobile network 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.739
 here after I have on the network 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.560
 mobile can fail them in the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.980
 sense that there will be signal but not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.220
 will say the company that is then will 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.220
 will follow the procedure of going to networks 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.090
 to mobile network options 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.569
 once here you will put mode 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.930
 manual or automatic depends on how you are 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.150
 your phone for example on me or gave me 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.880
 such a problem so I tell them is 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
 in automatic the manual is divided and if 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.130
 you are hopefully racing 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.819
 I'm looking for the available network and 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:49.349
 it just automatically got updated 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.170
 to the network and scholar of mexico so that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.819
 see was my cell phone there is the one for 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.489
 who know if I know that he can 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.430
 release and grab only have 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.239
 have to realize that to introduce the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.480
 mp2 code you need a phone with 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.480
 chip 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.680
 with a chip so that it can be released 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.019
 because if they are not if they are not of the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.019
 blackberry that have chip will not be able
