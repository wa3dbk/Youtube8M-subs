00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
don't even remember where I got the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.569 
don't even remember where I got the
wallpaper<00:03:36.810> from<00:03:36.989> there<00:03:37.890> was<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> shadow<00:03:38.310> look

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
wallpaper from there was a shadow look

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.000 
wallpaper from there was a shadow look
might<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.120> been<00:03:39.209> shadaloo<00:03:39.829> oops<00:03:40.829> sorry<00:03:40.980> I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
might have been shadaloo oops sorry I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.990 
might have been shadaloo oops sorry I
can<00:03:41.130> see<00:03:41.190> they're<00:03:41.310> flushing<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> light<00:03:41.790> there

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
can see they're flushing the light there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470 
can see they're flushing the light there
but<00:03:42.510> um<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.310> yeah<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> really<00:03:45.329> cool

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
but um so yeah this is a really cool

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.530 
but um so yeah this is a really cool
background<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.230> chose<00:03:46.440> anyway<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> guess<00:03:48.389> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
background I chose anyway so I guess the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.050 
background I chose anyway so I guess the
first<00:03:48.690> step<00:03:49.019> would<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:51.560> stick<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:53.060> ball

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
first step would be to stick the ball

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.240 
first step would be to stick the ball
top<00:03:54.329> over<00:03:54.600> here<00:03:54.900> kind<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.620> keeps<00:03:55.829> it<00:03:55.950> protects

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
top over here kind of keeps it protects

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.220 
top over here kind of keeps it protects
it<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.549> then<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.540> think<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:57.989> put<00:03:58.139> it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
it and then I think you just put it

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.089 
it and then I think you just put it
simply<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:58.950> that's<00:03:59.940> it

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
simply put it in that's it

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.550 

looks<00:04:03.099> like<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.459> did<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.450> put<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:04.959> in<00:04:05.080> wrong<00:04:05.230> I

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
looks like it did I put it in wrong I

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.949 
looks like it did I put it in wrong I
see<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.760> when<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.060> put<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.299> in<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.569> put<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.840> in

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
see so when you put it in you put it in

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.860 
see so when you put it in you put it in
this<00:04:08.110> side<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.730> joystick<00:04:10.180> closer<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.840> way

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
this side the joystick closer that way

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.530 
this side the joystick closer that way
the<00:04:11.019> string<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.560> again<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.980> way<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:13.239> then

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
the string that again the way and then

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.030 
the string that again the way and then
you<00:04:13.810> just<00:04:13.959> zip<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.140> up<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.409> that's<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.769> there's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
you just zip it up and that's it there's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.920 
you just zip it up and that's it there's
actually<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.280> lot<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.640> extra<00:04:15.940> space<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.780> this

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
actually a lot of extra space and this

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.300 
actually a lot of extra space and this
thing's<00:04:17.139> it<00:04:17.260> could<00:04:17.380> fit<00:04:17.560> other<00:04:17.739> things<00:04:18.040> again

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
thing's it could fit other things again

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.629 
thing's it could fit other things again
so<00:04:19.060> it's<00:04:19.180> pretty<00:04:19.299> pretty<00:04:19.660> cool<00:04:20.459> there<00:04:21.459> you<00:04:21.549> go

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
so it's pretty pretty cool there you go

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.490 
so it's pretty pretty cool there you go
so<00:04:22.090> that's<00:04:22.270> what<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.449> looks<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.780> when<00:04:23.350> it's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
so that's what it looks like when it's

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.900 
so that's what it looks like when it's
inside<00:04:23.770> although<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:24.550> only<00:04:24.669> see<00:04:24.790> what

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
inside although you can only see what

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.680 
inside although you can only see what
it's<00:04:25.030> inside<00:04:25.449> but<00:04:26.440> uh<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.240> madcatz

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
it's inside but uh that's the madcatz

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.710 
it's inside but uh that's the madcatz
bag<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:30.010> let<00:04:30.310> me<00:04:30.370> see<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.699> I'm<00:04:31.330> trying<00:04:31.600> to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
bag and let me see here I'm trying to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.180 
bag and let me see here I'm trying to
put<00:04:31.840> some<00:04:31.990> stuff<00:04:32.229> in<00:04:32.350> there<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.620> accountancy

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
put some stuff in there just accountancy

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.610 
put some stuff in there just accountancy
so<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:33.910> guess<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:34.840> really<00:04:34.870> want<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.380> like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
so I guess if you really want it to like

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.590 
so I guess if you really want it to like
say<00:04:35.830> what<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.430> do<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.030> actually<00:04:37.120> carry<00:04:37.479> a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
say what I do is I actually carry a

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.080 
say what I do is I actually carry a
little<00:04:37.930> towel<00:04:38.110> with<00:04:38.380> me<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:40.000> me

little towel with me and you know for me
my<00:04:40.270> hands<00:04:40.479> get<00:04:40.630> sweaty<00:04:40.690> when<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.229> play<00:04:41.470> for

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
my hands get sweaty when I play for

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.379 
my hands get sweaty when I play for
hours<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.280> hours<00:04:42.370> so<00:04:43.000> I'm<00:04:43.090> going<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.300> turn

hours and hours so I'm going to turn

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.600 
hours and hours so I'm going to turn
them<00:04:43.539> in<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.800> stick<00:04:45.039> can<00:04:45.190> sometimes<00:04:45.460> get<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
them in the stick can sometimes get a

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.800 
them in the stick can sometimes get a
little<00:04:45.639> dirty<00:04:45.910> little<00:04:46.210> gritty<00:04:46.449> so<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.720> can

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
little dirty little gritty so you can

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.689 
little dirty little gritty so you can
actually<00:04:46.930> finish<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.500> towel<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.860> here<00:04:48.130> should

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
actually finish the towel in here should

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.100 
actually finish the towel in here should
fit<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.910> lot<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.210> here<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.630> got<00:04:49.780> like<00:04:50.080> you

know some dry snacks you probably

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.340 
know some dry snacks you probably
shouldn't<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.419> this<00:04:52.570> with<00:04:52.720> water<00:04:52.900> but<00:04:53.169> if<00:04:53.289> you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
shouldn't do this with water but if you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
have a water bottle you could just stick

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.730 
have a water bottle you could just stick
it<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.120> there<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.110> fit<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.320> lot<00:04:56.440> in

there to kind of save yourself some room

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.960 
there to kind of save yourself some room
you<00:04:59.770> can<00:04:59.889> fit<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.039> jacket<00:05:00.460> in<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:00.699> in<00:05:00.850> case

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
you can fit a jacket in there in case

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.430 
you can fit a jacket in there in case
it's<00:05:01.210> cold<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.840> gets<00:05:01.930> really<00:05:02.050> hot<00:05:02.289> in<00:05:02.380> the

it's cold and it gets really hot in the
tournament<00:05:02.830> room<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:05.229> that's<00:05:05.380> pretty<00:05:05.530> cool

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
tournament room so that's pretty cool
