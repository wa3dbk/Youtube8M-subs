00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
all right as you can see by the video I

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.960 
all right as you can see by the video I
have<00:00:17.510> been<00:00:18.510> getting<00:00:18.720> some<00:00:18.990> work<00:00:19.170> done<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.970> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have been getting some work done on the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.020 
have been getting some work done on the
excavator<00:00:22.100> it<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.280> uh<00:00:23.900> all<00:00:24.900> hooked<00:00:25.200> up<00:00:26.030> there

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
excavator it is uh all hooked up there

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.090 
excavator it is uh all hooked up there
has<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:27.450> a<00:00:27.510> change<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.260> plans

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
has been a change of plans

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.279 
has been a change of plans
with<00:00:29.310> how<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.699> excavator<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.780> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> be

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
with how this excavator is going to be

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.750 
with how this excavator is going to be
finished<00:00:31.940> we<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.920> show<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
finished we will I will show you that in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600 
finished we will I will show you that in
another<00:00:36.149> video<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> later<00:00:37.500> date<00:00:37.829> I'm<00:00:38.190> still

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
another video at a later date I'm still

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
another video at a later date I'm still
waiting<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:38.940> parts<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
waiting for parts to get it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.620 
waiting for parts to get it
a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:40.980> further<00:00:41.220> along<00:00:41.520> before<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> show

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
a little bit further along before I show

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.420 
a little bit further along before I show
you<00:00:42.660> guys<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> video<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.430> pretty

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you guys so in this video I will pretty

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.170 
you guys so in this video I will pretty
much<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.030> show<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.649> how<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.890> works<00:00:50.180> not

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
much just show you how it works not

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.870 
much just show you how it works not
going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.510> doing<00:00:51.690> any<00:00:51.930> digging

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
going to be doing any digging

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.410 
going to be doing any digging
I've<00:00:54.239> still<00:00:54.540> got<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.880> reinforce<00:00:56.880> all<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I've still got to reinforce all the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.830 
I've still got to reinforce all the
mounts<00:00:57.840> I've<00:00:58.020> broke<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.500> off<00:00:58.710> twice<00:00:59.160> now

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
mounts I've broke one off twice now

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.819 
mounts I've broke one off twice now
messing<00:01:00.840> around<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.559> yeah<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.829> think

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
messing around with them yeah I think

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.560 
messing around with them yeah I think
these<00:01:05.159> actuators<00:01:05.579> are<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.360> out

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
these actuators are going to work out

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.770 
these actuators are going to work out
pretty<00:01:06.780> good

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
pretty good

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
pretty good
that's<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> bucket<00:01:10.820> I'm<00:01:11.820> still<00:01:12.210> trying<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that's the bucket I'm still trying to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
that's the bucket I'm still trying to
get<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> controls<00:01:13.909> I've<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:16.520> zero<00:01:17.520> get

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
get the controls I've got to zero get

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.289 
get the controls I've got to zero get
everything<00:01:18.979> set<00:01:19.979> how<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.580> comfortable<00:01:21.150> for

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
everything set how it's comfortable for

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
everything set how it's comfortable for
me<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:22.189> those<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.909> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
me to use those right now it's it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
me to use those right now it's it's
really<00:01:24.510> awkward<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.590> everything<00:01:29.070> works

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.250 

got<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> get<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.280> hang<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.420> controls<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
got to get the hang of the controls and

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.130 
got to get the hang of the controls and
one<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> actuators<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
one one thing with the actuators that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
one one thing with the actuators that
makes<00:01:40.350> its<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.830> make<00:01:40.980> it<00:01:41.160> really<00:01:41.460> hard

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
makes its going to make it really hard

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
makes its going to make it really hard
to<00:01:41.760> get<00:01:41.940> used<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.400> like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
to get used to is it's not like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
to get used to is it's not like
hydraulics<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:46.140> hydraulics<00:01:47.780> when<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> let

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
hydraulics with hydraulics when you let

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
hydraulics with hydraulics when you let
go<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.190> stick<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.810> stops<00:01:52.229> moving<00:01:52.700> but<00:01:53.700> on

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
go of the stick it stops moving but on

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.610 
go of the stick it stops moving but on
this<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.450> let<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.870> goes<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.440> to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
this when you let go it goes back to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.120 
this when you let go it goes back to
Center

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
Center

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.469 
Center
so<00:01:56.580> we're<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.940> try<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> figure<00:01:57.360> out

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
so we're going to try to figure out

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.670 
so we're going to try to figure out
something<00:01:58.070> some<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.930> either<00:02:00.930> modify<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
something some way to either modify the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
something some way to either modify the
actuators<00:02:02.550> or<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:03.660> everything<00:02:03.990> work

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
actuators or make everything work

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
actuators or make everything work
correctly<00:02:05.270> now<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.300> want<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:09.149> goes

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
correctly now I want it to so it it goes

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.870 
correctly now I want it to so it it goes
up<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.690> down<00:02:14.840> rotates<00:02:16.310> let<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> little

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
up and down rotates let me do a little

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.370 
up and down rotates let me do a little
work<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.450> servo<00:02:18.810> mount<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:21.420> not

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
work with the servo mount it's a not not

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.339 
work with the servo mount it's a not not
quite<00:02:22.739> perfect<00:02:23.250> yet

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:43.869 

vo<00:02:40.129> it's<00:02:41.129> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.540> really<00:02:42.540> tricky<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
vo it's going to be really tricky to

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:58.330 
vo it's going to be really tricky to
figure<00:02:44.879> out<00:02:45.180> how<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.390> dig<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.170> thing

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.270 

yeah<00:02:59.349> this<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.770> be<00:03:00.890> hard<00:03:01.450> yeah<00:03:02.450> I

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
yeah this is going to be hard yeah I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.440 
yeah this is going to be hard yeah I
think<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.370> guys<00:03:04.520> will<00:03:04.730> like<00:03:04.880> what<00:03:05.180> I've<00:03:05.270> got
