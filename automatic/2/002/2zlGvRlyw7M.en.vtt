going to cut them in slices and do them

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
going to cut them in slices and do them
on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> grill<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> grill<00:00:39.840> them

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
edges on every piece so just go ahead

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
edges on every piece so just go ahead
and<00:00:43.860> cut<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.160> into<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.579> quarter<00:00:45.300> inch
