00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
for a long time I guess this is the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
for a long time I guess this is the
first<00:00:14.400> installment<00:00:15.350> feels<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
first installment feels like it's just a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.170 
first installment feels like it's just a
thing<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.279> haven't<00:00:17.580> opened<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.940> package

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
