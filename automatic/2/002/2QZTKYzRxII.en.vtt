00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
better reflect its ultimate kind of

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.899 
better reflect its ultimate kind of
nature<00:01:20.259> it's<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.709> you<00:01:20.920> know<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> hard<00:01:21.520> CC

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
nature it's a you know it is a hard CC

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.760 
nature it's a you know it is a hard CC
it<00:01:22.119> does<00:01:22.389> drag<00:01:22.630> people<00:01:22.959> around<00:01:23.170> but<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.499> didn't

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it does drag people around but it didn't

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.279 
it does drag people around but it didn't
quite<00:01:23.829> have<00:01:24.249> that<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.509> is<00:01:25.659> my<00:01:25.779> big<00:01:25.990> skill

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
quite have that this is my big skill

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.080 
quite have that this is my big skill
this<00:01:26.529> is<00:01:26.619> my<00:01:26.740> marquee<00:01:27.130> moment<00:01:27.549> feeling<00:01:27.819> and<00:01:28.060> I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
this is my marquee moment feeling and I

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.699 
this is my marquee moment feeling and I
think<00:01:28.299> that's<00:01:28.450> what<00:01:28.569> scar<00:01:28.810> players<00:01:29.079> expect<00:01:29.560> so

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
think that's what scar players expect so

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:30.989 
think that's what scar players expect so
we've<00:01:29.829> increased<00:01:30.069> that<00:01:30.340> by<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.549> little<00:01:30.850> bit

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
we've increased that by a little bit

we've increased that by a little bit
we'll<00:01:31.329> see<00:01:31.509> where<00:01:31.659> it<00:01:31.689> stands<00:01:31.959> after<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.409> and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
we'll see where it stands after this and

we'll see where it stands after this and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
and it doesn't do anything we don't like

players<00:03:22.459> are<00:03:22.609> particularly<00:03:23.030> attached<00:03:23.389> to

players are particularly attached to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.449 
players are particularly attached to
that<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.259> what<00:03:24.379> we<00:03:24.470> did<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.650> instead<00:03:24.889> of<00:03:25.099> making

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
that so what we did is instead of making

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.129 
that so what we did is instead of making
the<00:03:25.639> duration<00:03:26.060> scale<00:03:26.359> as<00:03:26.509> it<00:03:26.599> goes<00:03:26.720> up<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:26.989> made

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
the duration scale as it goes up we made

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.929 
the duration scale as it goes up we made
it<00:03:27.259> a<00:03:27.319> flat<00:03:27.590> rate<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.069> in<00:03:28.189> the<00:03:28.280> middle<00:03:28.370> we

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
it a flat rate that's in the middle we

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.789 
it a flat rate that's in the middle we
actually<00:03:29.239> give<00:03:29.389> it<00:03:29.479> a<00:03:29.540> base<00:03:29.750> damage<00:03:30.049> as<00:03:30.439> well

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
actually give it a base damage as well

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.890 
actually give it a base damage as well
as<00:03:31.009> scaling<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.609> we've<00:03:32.180> actually<00:03:32.299> bumped

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
as scaling and we've actually bumped

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.420 
as scaling and we've actually bumped
kind<00:03:33.139> of<00:03:33.199> that<00:03:33.290> base<00:03:33.500> damage<00:03:33.709> up<00:03:34.009> from<00:03:34.250> his

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
kind of that base damage up from his

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.369 
kind of that base damage up from his
from<00:03:35.060> driving<00:03:35.449> out<00:03:35.659> of<00:03:35.780> his<00:03:35.870> total<00:03:36.169> attack

from driving out of his total attack

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.740 
from driving out of his total attack
damage<00:03:36.530> into<00:03:36.889> its<00:03:37.040> own<00:03:37.220> value<00:03:37.519> what<00:03:38.329> this<00:03:38.509> does

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
damage into its own value what this does

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.020 
damage into its own value what this does
is<00:03:38.930> not<00:03:39.079> only<00:03:39.259> gives<00:03:39.439> it<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.650> buff<00:03:40.519> in<00:03:40.669> the<00:03:40.699> now

is not only gives it a buff in the now

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.689 
is not only gives it a buff in the now
but<00:03:41.750> also<00:03:41.989> allows<00:03:42.590> us<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:43.040> tune<00:03:43.250> additional

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
these things win balancing Corki so that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.960 
these things win balancing Corki so that

immediately

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
immediately

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.110 
immediately
one<00:04:22.259> new<00:04:22.410> system<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:22.889> introduced<00:04:23.699> to<00:04:23.789> Dominion

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
one new system we introduced to Dominion

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.999 
one new system we introduced to Dominion
was<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.330> idea<00:04:24.539> of<00:04:24.599> personal<00:04:24.840> score<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.830> old

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
was the idea of personal score the old

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.279 
was the idea of personal score the old
kind<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.340> killed<00:04:26.699> death<00:04:27.030> assist<00:04:27.509> ratio<00:04:27.960> thing

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
kind of killed death assist ratio thing

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.020 
kind of killed death assist ratio thing
wasn't<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.770> good<00:04:29.099> indicator<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.669> who<00:04:29.849> is<00:04:30.000> doing

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
wasn't a good indicator of who is doing

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.330 
wasn't a good indicator of who is doing
well<00:04:30.419> on<00:04:30.569> Dominion<00:04:30.810> who<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.139> doing<00:04:31.289> poorly<00:04:31.680> we

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
well on Dominion who is doing poorly we

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
well on Dominion who is doing poorly we
think<00:04:32.520> players<00:04:32.699> really<00:04:33.060> enjoy<00:04:33.419> being<00:04:33.780> able<00:04:33.870> to

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
think players really enjoy being able to

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.270 
think players really enjoy being able to
measure<00:04:34.199> themselves<00:04:34.500> up<00:04:34.830> against<00:04:35.069> the<00:04:35.160> other

really<00:04:43.440> does<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> good<00:04:43.800> job<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:44.039> rewarding

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
really does a good job of rewarding

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.490 
really does a good job of rewarding
offense<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.120> kills<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.870> does<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:46.259> do<00:04:46.470> a

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
offense and kills but it does not do a

good job of rewarding minion pushing or

good job of rewarding minion pushing or
defensive<00:04:50.250> points<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.759> those<00:04:51.210> are<00:04:51.360> really

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
defensive points and those are really

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.270 
defensive points and those are really
important<00:04:52.020> actions<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.530> Dominion<00:04:52.860> as<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:52.979> think

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
important actions in Dominion as I think

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.710 
important actions in Dominion as I think
a<00:04:53.460> lot<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.759> people<00:04:53.849> have<00:04:54.150> started<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.569> figure

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
a lot of people have started to figure

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.230 
a lot of people have started to figure
out<00:04:54.960> more<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:55.889> more<00:04:55.979> as<00:04:56.159> times<00:04:56.340> gone<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.610> so

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
out more and more as times gone on so

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.700 
out more and more as times gone on so
what<00:04:57.360> we've<00:04:57.449> done<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.690> we've<00:04:57.810> increased<00:04:58.139> the

thing<00:05:29.610> we're<00:05:29.729> seeing<00:05:29.909> a<00:05:29.969> lot<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.210> Dominion<00:05:30.509> is

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
thing we're seeing a lot on Dominion is

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.589 
thing we're seeing a lot on Dominion is
a<00:05:30.750> hyper<00:05:31.620> carries<00:05:32.070> and<00:05:32.250> very<00:05:32.460> rapidly<00:05:33.090> scaling

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
a hyper carries and very rapidly scaling

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.629 
a hyper carries and very rapidly scaling
characters<00:05:34.080> are<00:05:34.500> seeing<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:34.979> lot<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.219> play<00:05:35.460> and

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
characters are seeing a lot of play and

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.399 
characters are seeing a lot of play and
a<00:05:35.669> lot<00:05:35.789> of<00:05:35.880> dominance<00:05:36.300> on<00:05:36.389> Dominion<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.960> one

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
a lot of dominance on Dominion and one

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.839 
a lot of dominance on Dominion and one
of<00:05:37.500> those<00:05:37.560> things<00:05:37.830> that's<00:05:38.039> contributing<00:05:38.759> to

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
of those things that's contributing to

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.510 
of those things that's contributing to
that<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.240> inevitability<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:40.169> late-game

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
that is the inevitability of a late-game

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.029 
that is the inevitability of a late-game
this<00:05:41.690> XP<00:05:42.690> nerf<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.080> going<00:05:43.349> to<00:05:43.469> reduce<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
this XP nerf is going to reduce the

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.950 
this XP nerf is going to reduce the
inevitability<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.729> that<00:05:44.909> into<00:05:45.210> closer<00:05:45.630> or

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
inevitability of that into closer or

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.649 
inevitability of that into closer or
longer<00:05:46.500> games<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:47.039> when<00:05:47.310> you<00:05:47.400> take<00:05:47.639> a<00:05:47.820> hyper

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
longer games so when you take a hyper

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.870 
longer games so when you take a hyper
cari<00:05:48.990> champion<00:05:49.219> instead<00:05:50.219> of<00:05:50.310> being<00:05:50.490> like<00:05:50.550> I

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
cari champion instead of being like I

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.430 
cari champion instead of being like I
know<00:05:50.940> I'll<00:05:51.240> get<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.569> this<00:05:51.690> point<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.169> then<00:05:52.349> I

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
know I'll get to this point and then I

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.890 
know I'll get to this point and then I
will<00:05:52.590> dominate<00:05:53.009> you<00:05:53.490> go<00:05:53.669> if<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.449> game<00:05:54.599> gets<00:05:54.750> to

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
will dominate you go if the game gets to

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.749 
will dominate you go if the game gets to
this<00:05:55.020> point<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.500> know<00:05:55.650> I'll<00:05:55.949> be<00:05:56.069> stronger<00:05:56.610> so

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
this point I know I'll be stronger so

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.939 
this point I know I'll be stronger so
I'm<00:05:56.880> kind<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.240> betting<00:05:57.960> on<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.080> long<00:05:58.319> game<00:05:58.590> this

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
I'm kind of betting on a long game this

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.350 
I'm kind of betting on a long game this
allows<00:05:59.190> teams<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.550> develop<00:05:59.699> strategies

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
allows teams to develop strategies

around these hyper carries and around

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.070 
around these hyper carries and around
that<00:06:02.580> different<00:06:03.000> game<00:06:03.180> length<00:06:03.419> will<00:06:03.990> be

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
that different game length will be

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.959 
that different game length will be

early game
actions<00:06:35.160> and<00:06:35.370> we<00:06:35.460> don't<00:06:35.580> think<00:06:35.790> that's<00:06:35.940> a<00:06:36.030> good

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
actions and we don't think that's a good

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.690 
actions and we don't think that's a good
differentiation<00:06:37.050> of<00:06:37.170> skill<00:06:37.530> we<00:06:38.010> think<00:06:38.220> early

differentiation of skill we think early

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
games should matter mid game should

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.420 
games should matter mid game should
matter<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:40.470> late<00:06:40.650> game<00:06:40.860> should<00:06:41.070> matter<00:06:41.190> and

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
matter and late game should matter and

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.800 
matter and late game should matter and
this<00:06:41.550> change<00:06:41.790> is<00:06:41.910> one<00:06:42.090> step<00:06:42.390> in<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:42.630> direction

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
this change is one step in the direction

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.100 
this change is one step in the direction
of<00:06:43.230> making<00:06:43.950> that<00:06:44.070> be<00:06:44.910> completely<00:06:45.690> balanced

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
of making that be completely balanced

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.390 
of making that be completely balanced
and<00:06:46.200> even<00:06:46.470> we'll<00:06:46.680> be<00:06:46.800> looking<00:06:46.950> at<00:06:47.190> more

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
and even we'll be looking at more

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.680 
and even we'll be looking at more
adjustments<00:06:47.850> as<00:06:47.940> we<00:06:47.970> go<00:06:48.090> forward<00:06:48.390> but<00:06:48.570> we

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
adjustments as we go forward but we

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.670 
adjustments as we go forward but we
think<00:06:48.870> this<00:06:48.990> is<00:06:49.110> going<00:06:49.260> to<00:06:49.320> have<00:06:49.410> a<00:06:49.470> pretty

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
think this is going to have a pretty

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.650 
think this is going to have a pretty
major<00:06:49.830> impact<00:06:50.370> on<00:06:50.580> making<00:06:51.240> sure<00:06:51.270> the<00:06:51.480> most

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660
