of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.550> kick<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.029> rapid-firing<00:00:27.570> search<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of the kick and rapid-firing search is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.589 
of the kick and rapid-firing search is
because<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.640> both<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> ump45

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> recent<00:00:31.410> patch<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.550> does<00:00:32.700> more

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
in the recent patch is it does more

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.280 
in the recent patch is it does more
damage<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.270> range<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> thought<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> know

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
damage at range so I thought you know
