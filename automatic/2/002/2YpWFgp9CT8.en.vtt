00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
ran into some really good pine and I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.549 
ran into some really good pine and I
thought<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.300> would<00:00:12.420> show<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.750> how<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.349> could

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
thought I would show you how you could

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.029 
thought I would show you how you could
find<00:00:13.860> some<00:00:14.160> fat<00:00:14.940> wood<00:00:15.210> type<00:00:15.740> material<00:00:16.740> off<00:00:17.010> of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
find some fat wood type material off of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.400 
find some fat wood type material off of
the<00:00:17.279> tree<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:18.510> would<00:00:18.630> help<00:00:18.930> aid<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.380> in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the tree that would help aid you in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.099 
the tree that would help aid you in
starting<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> fire<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
starting a fire this is actually just a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.769 
starting a fire this is actually just a
lower<00:00:22.289> branch<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> pine<00:00:23.340> tree<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.510> lot<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
lower branch on a pine tree and a lot of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
lower branch on a pine tree and a lot of
times<00:00:24.960> these<00:00:25.199> will<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.470> rotten<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.189> dead

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
times these will be rotten or dead

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.859 
times these will be rotten or dead
and<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.660> you'll<00:00:27.779> cut<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.109> pretty<00:00:28.289> close<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
and if you'll cut it pretty close to the

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
and if you'll cut it pretty close to the
trunk<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.050> tree<00:00:31.080> you'll<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:32.009> there's<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
trunk of the tree you'll see there's a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.819 
trunk of the tree you'll see there's a
pretty<00:00:32.820> high<00:00:32.910> concentration<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.899> pine<00:00:34.230> resin

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
pretty high concentration of pine resin

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.660 
pretty high concentration of pine resin
on<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
on this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
on this
this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.750> good<00:00:36.960> fire<00:00:37.200> starting

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this is really good fire starting

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
this is really good fire starting
material<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.700> also<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.510> some

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
material you can also find these on some

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
material you can also find these on some
dead<00:00:39.870> trees<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.500> happens<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> alive

but one look at a dead one here in a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
but one look at a dead one here in a
second<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:43.980> falling<00:00:44.340> over

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
second this is one that's falling over

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630 
second this is one that's falling over
and<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:46.230> exposed<00:00:46.649> its<00:00:46.860> root<00:00:47.100> ball<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.610> the

and it's exposed its root ball or the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
and it's exposed its root ball or the
root<00:00:47.879> system<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.320> air<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> see

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
root system to the air here you can see

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.080 
root system to the air here you can see
this<00:00:59.340> has<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this has got a little bit of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
this has got a little bit of
concentration<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.989> SAP<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
concentration of SAP in here and it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
concentration of SAP in here and it
smells<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.769> pine-sol<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> real<00:01:05.729> heavy

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
smells like pine-sol have a real heavy

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.080 
smells like pine-sol have a real heavy
smell<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> pine<00:01:07.170> saw<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.430> super<00:01:08.909> rich

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
smell of pine saw this is not super rich

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.260 
smell of pine saw this is not super rich
but<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.200> sure<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> kept<00:01:10.830> looking<00:01:11.010> around

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
but I'm sure if you kept looking around

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.730 
but I'm sure if you kept looking around
it<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.479> fine<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.260> split<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> couple

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it would be fine I will split a couple

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.380 
it would be fine I will split a couple
of<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.010> pieces<00:01:14.310> down<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.700> show<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.240> what

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
of these pieces down and show you what

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.960 
of these pieces down and show you what
it<00:01:15.509> looks<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> burn<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.850> as<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it looks like when you burn it as you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
it looks like when you burn it as you
can<00:01:18.090> see<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.140> high

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
can see this has got some high

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
can see this has got some high
concentration<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.280> resin<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
concentration of resin in here this is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
concentration of resin in here this is
what<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.200> after<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> darker<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what you're after the darker it is the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.319 
what you're after the darker it is the
more<00:01:27.119> concentration<00:01:27.960> it'll<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:29.150> this<00:01:30.150> will

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
more concentration it'll have this will

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109 
more concentration it'll have this will
be<00:01:30.450> almost<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.960> orange<00:01:31.350> red<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.579> really

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
be almost an orange red if it's really

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.749 
be almost an orange red if it's really
concentrated<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.490> shave<00:01:35.729> off

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
concentrated now you can just shave off

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.830 
concentrated now you can just shave off
a<00:01:36.000> couple<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.509> pieces<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.870 

this<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.960> an<00:01:44.080> excellent<00:01:44.500> fire<00:01:45.040> starter

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
this is an excellent fire starter

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.760 
this is an excellent fire starter
could<00:01:46.570> actually<00:01:46.689> make<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> torch<00:01:47.350> out<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.650> this

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
could actually make a torch out of this

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.149 
could actually make a torch out of this
thing<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.189> needed<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:49.229> split<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.350> up<00:01:50.470> into

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
thing if you needed to split it up into

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.429 
thing if you needed to split it up into
smaller<00:01:51.640> pieces<00:01:51.909> now<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.840> can<00:01:53.049> see<00:01:53.259> this

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
smaller pieces now you can see this

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.170 
smaller pieces now you can see this
starting<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.890> melt<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.830> resin<00:01:57.250> out

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
starting to melt some of the resin out

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.230 
starting to melt some of the resin out
of<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.789> can<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.119> bubbling

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 

now<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.870> can<00:02:07.080> see<00:02:07.260> it<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.560> good<00:02:07.710> melting

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
now you can see it really good melting

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:16.130 
now you can see it really good melting
out

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 

now<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.100> you're<00:02:17.250> wanting<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.520> get<00:02:17.670> into<00:02:17.880> good

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
now if you're wanting to get into good

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.360 
now if you're wanting to get into good
fat<00:02:18.270> wood<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.560> actually<00:02:19.920> come<00:02:20.100> into<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
fat wood you can actually come into the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.690 
fat wood you can actually come into the
stump<00:02:22.220> start<00:02:23.220> carrying<00:02:23.610> away<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.370> loose

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
stump start carrying away all this loose

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.860 
stump start carrying away all this loose
stuff<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:35.490> you're<00:02:35.700> after<00:02:35.870> this

stuff now this is what you're after this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.370 
stuff now this is what you're after this
stuff<00:02:37.230> inside<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:39.060> rotted<00:02:39.510> down<00:02:39.540> it's

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
stuff inside it's not rotted down it's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.500 
stuff inside it's not rotted down it's
really<00:02:40.470> sticky<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.880> keep<00:02:42.090> digging<00:02:42.240> into

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
really sticky you can keep digging into

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.530 
really sticky you can keep digging into
this<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.200> process<00:02:43.740> more<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.240> pretty

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
this and process more this is pretty

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.170 
this and process more this is pretty
hard<00:02:51.380> now<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.680> see<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.850> color

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
hard now you can see these color

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.900 
hard now you can see these color
differences<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.370> where<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> high

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
differences this is where the high

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.080 
differences this is where the high
concentration<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.840> SAP<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.709> located

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.330 

pine<00:03:05.750> nuts<00:03:05.900> are<00:03:06.110> also<00:03:06.230> good<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:06.830> finding<00:03:06.980> high

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
pine nuts are also good for finding high

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.580 
pine nuts are also good for finding high
concentrations<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.180> resin<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:09.080> don't

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
concentrations of resin so don't

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.520 
concentrations of resin so don't
discount<00:03:09.980> those<00:03:10.250> either

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
discount those either

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.660 
discount those either
you're<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.860> pine<00:03:13.700> not<00:03:15.370> part<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.550> way

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
you're just a pine not part of the way

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.490 
you're just a pine not part of the way
up<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.629> see<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:17.989> got<00:03:18.170> some<00:03:18.349> pretty

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
up you can see it's got some pretty

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.080 
up you can see it's got some pretty
heavy<00:03:18.800> concentrations<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.849> SAP<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.019> that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
heavy concentrations of SAP in that

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.030 
heavy concentrations of SAP in that
don't<00:03:23.090> forget<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.420> look<00:03:23.569> for<00:03:23.629> pine<00:03:24.019> whether<00:03:24.890> it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
don't forget to look for pine whether it

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.589 
don't forget to look for pine whether it
be<00:03:25.129> on<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.280> live<00:03:25.519> tree<00:03:25.819> or<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> dead<00:03:26.209> tree<00:03:26.450> you

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
be on the live tree or a dead tree you

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.180 
be on the live tree or a dead tree you
can<00:03:26.720> usually<00:03:26.870> find<00:03:27.260> this<00:03:27.530> heavy

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
can usually find this heavy

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.729 
can usually find this heavy
concentration<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.120> SAP<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.410> will<00:03:30.530> help

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
concentration of SAP and it will help

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.500 
concentration of SAP and it will help
you<00:03:30.860> get<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.010> fire<00:03:31.220> started<00:03:31.390> thanks<00:03:32.390> for

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
you get a fire started thanks for
