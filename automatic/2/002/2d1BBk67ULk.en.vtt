00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630

busy<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:15.960> professional<00:01:16.679> skater<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.340> always

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
busy as a professional skater I always

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
busy as a professional skater I always
hoped<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.179> would<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> never<00:01:19.770> truly

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
hoped I would be but I never truly

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.699 
hoped I would be but I never truly
believed<00:01:20.850> deep<00:01:21.390> down<00:01:21.420> inside<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.229> me<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
believed deep down inside of me that I

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:23.959 
believed deep down inside of me that I
would<00:01:22.859> be<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.219> I<00:01:23.250> never<00:01:23.459> thought<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> would

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
would be but I never thought I would

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.520 
would be but I never thought I would
make<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> Olympic<00:01:24.539> team<00:01:24.569> me<00:01:24.869> either

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
make the Olympic team me either

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
make the Olympic team me either
so<00:01:25.890> how<00:01:26.069> far<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.399> work<00:01:26.609> tabular<00:01:27.060> hard<00:01:27.659> work

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so how far is work tabular hard work

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.199 
so how far is work tabular hard work
does<00:01:28.140> pay<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.890> certainly<00:01:29.310> does<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.849> you
