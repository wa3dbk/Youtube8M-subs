with<00:00:40.230> oil<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.850> offered<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> try<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.809> back

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
with oil so we offered to try and back

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the wrecker up the hill close enough to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.110 
the wrecker up the hill close enough to
pick<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.809> end<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> beetle<00:00:47.120> so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pick up the back end of the beetle so

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
pick up the back end of the beetle so
what<00:00:48.300> year<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:51.590> Super<00:00:52.590> Beetle

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:07.310 

and<00:00:56.399> you've<00:00:57.000> flopped<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.629> over<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> side

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.890 

and<00:01:13.670> what's<00:01:13.850> under<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.179> hood

backing up the hill over the rocks

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
backing up the hill over the rocks
proved<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.659> quite<00:01:30.899> difficult<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.799> don't

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
proved to be quite difficult I don't

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.920 
proved to be quite difficult I don't
think<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.060> been<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> at

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
think I would have been able to do it at

00:01:33.930 --> 00:02:10.249 
think I would have been able to do it at
all<00:01:34.079> without<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.799> new<00:01:34.920> grizzly<00:01:35.369> Locker

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.190 

Oh<00:02:11.120> careful<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.930> better<00:02:13.110> pull

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
Oh careful I think we better pull

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.130 
Oh careful I think we better pull
forward<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.920> try<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> little<00:02:14.370> different<00:02:14.760> line

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.110 

once<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.319> got<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> record<00:02:19.980> close<00:02:20.159> enough<00:02:20.519> we

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
once we got the record close enough we

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
once we got the record close enough we
figured<00:02:21.480> we'd<00:02:21.690> wrap<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.080> strap<00:02:22.379> around<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
figured we'd wrap the strap around the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
figured we'd wrap the strap around the
Rockwell<00:02:23.790> axle<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.599> lift<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.080> right<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.409> by

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
Rockwell axle and lift it right out by

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:38.350 
Rockwell axle and lift it right out by
the<00:02:25.650> wheel

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.240 

we<00:02:39.360> soon<00:02:39.600> found<00:02:39.870> out<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.500> drive<00:02:40.710> line<00:02:41.010> on

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
we soon found out that the drive line on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.670 
we soon found out that the drive line on
the<00:02:41.340> beetle<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:42.150> all<00:02:42.330> bound<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.530> was

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the beetle was all bound up and it was

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.800 
the beetle was all bound up and it was
stuck<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.100> gear<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:45.300> didn't<00:02:45.600> slow<00:02:45.720> down

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
stuck in gear but that didn't slow down

00:02:45.810 --> 00:03:31.780 
stuck in gear but that didn't slow down
the<00:02:46.170> wrecker<00:02:46.380> much

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.460 

once<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.330> Beatles<00:03:33.660> were<00:03:33.810> end<00:03:34.050> up<00:03:34.260> out

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
once we got the Beatles were end up out

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.550 
once we got the Beatles were end up out
of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> hole<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:36.510> was<00:03:36.720> able<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.050> roll<00:03:37.320> now

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
of the hole and it was able to roll now

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.310 
of the hole and it was able to roll now
we<00:03:38.160> decided<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.910> could<00:03:39.060> unhook<00:03:39.450> drive<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
we decided we could unhook drive the

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.560 
we decided we could unhook drive the
record<00:03:40.650> down<00:03:40.740> to<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> bottom<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.430> hill

going<00:03:45.570> forward<00:03:46.020> in<00:03:46.170> downhill<00:03:46.590> was<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> whole

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
going forward in downhill was a whole

00:03:47.700 --> 00:04:40.350 
going forward in downhill was a whole
lot<00:03:48.030> easier<00:03:48.060> than<00:03:48.750> backing<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.350> up<00:03:49.470> there

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.940 

with<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.480> winch<00:04:41.690> cable<00:04:41.780> still<00:04:42.380> attached<00:04:42.650> to

the front and also using one on the rear

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.280 
the front and also using one on the rear
we<00:04:46.130> were<00:04:46.190> able<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.670> work<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.270> bug<00:04:47.660> down<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.170> the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
we were able to work the bug down to the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:05:22.999 
we were able to work the bug down to the
bottom<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.740> hill<00:04:48.950> on<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> flat<00:04:49.670> ground
