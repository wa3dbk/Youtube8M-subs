00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
everything like that and we are not

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.639 
everything like that and we are not
looking<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.180> any<00:00:39.329> ghost<00:00:39.690> players<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
looking for any ghost players at the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
looking for any ghost players at the
moment<00:00:41.010> mainly<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> people

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
moment mainly because a lot of people

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.430 
moment mainly because a lot of people
don't<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.190> watching<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> game<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
don't really like watching the game and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.750 
don't really like watching the game and
I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> reason<00:00:47.070> behind<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
I think the reason behind that is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
I think the reason behind that is
because<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.300> soon<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.840> game<00:00:49.079> comes<00:00:49.410> out

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
because as soon as a new game comes out

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.610 
because as soon as a new game comes out
everyone<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.489> starts<00:00:50.850> playing<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.629> they

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
everyone just starts playing it and they

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
everyone just starts playing it and they
have<00:00:52.800> no<00:00:52.980> variety<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.640> their<00:00:53.670> episodes<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
have no variety in their episodes and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
have no variety in their episodes and
everything<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.140> ghosts<00:00:56.039> recently<00:00:56.250> came<00:00:56.699> out

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
everything so ghosts recently came out

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.930 
everything so ghosts recently came out
we're<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.090> recently<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> few<00:00:57.840> months<00:00:58.170> ago<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
we're not recently a few months ago and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.049 
we're not recently a few months ago and
everyone<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.239> started<00:01:00.480> playing<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
everyone just started playing that and

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
everyone just started playing that and
yeah<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:03.270> why<00:01:03.359> we're<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.870> recruiting

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
