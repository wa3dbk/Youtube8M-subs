little you know vibration but it works

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
little you know vibration but it works
nice<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.460> supporting<00:00:35.969> hand

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
completely out of the way the red dot so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.109 
completely out of the way the red dot so
let's<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> looks<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.979> outside<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
let's go see if it looks like outside so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
let's go see if it looks like outside so
you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.780> something<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> red

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you can see something through the red

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.969 
you can see something through the red
dot<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.689> okay<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.750> before<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.650> night

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
dot now right okay so before at night

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.620 
dot now right okay so before at night
that's<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.640> much<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.479> is

that's pretty much what you would see is
a<00:01:12.659> red<00:01:12.960> dot<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:15.560> do<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.740> let<00:01:16.890> me<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
a red dot now do now let me get this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.870 
a red dot now do now let me get this
thing<00:01:17.340> lined<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.880> that

thing lined up right as you can see that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.910 
thing lined up right as you can see that
with<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> target<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> definitely<00:01:26.420> can<00:01:27.420> see

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
with a target you definitely can see

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
with a target you definitely can see
what<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.340> shooting<00:01:30.740> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
what you're going to be shooting and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
what you're going to be shooting and
without<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> light<00:01:33.320> not<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.650> much<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:37.820> even<00:01:38.820> on

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
without the light not so much so even on

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.990 
without the light not so much so even on
a<00:01:38.970> 22<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.900> might<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> light<00:01:41.000> as

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a 22 you might want to have a light as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.550 
a 22 you might want to have a light as
you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.659> nothing<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.439> just

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you can see it's nothing to it and just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.190 
you can see it's nothing to it and just
tape<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> spacer<00:01:47.990> okay<00:01:48.990> yeah

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
tape it on there with a spacer okay yeah

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.120 
tape it on there with a spacer okay yeah
it<00:01:49.380> gives<00:01:49.530> me<00:01:49.740> pretty<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.240> distance<00:01:51.240> there

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it gives me pretty good distance there

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.130 
it gives me pretty good distance there
you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.310> pretty<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> woods

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.380 

yeah<00:01:58.160> like<00:01:59.160> I<00:01:59.310> said<00:01:59.340> before<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.940> this<00:02:00.060> cheap

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
yeah like I said before on this cheap

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
yeah like I said before on this cheap
red<00:02:00.600> dot<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.410> dot<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.860> very<00:02:02.460> very<00:02:02.700> bright

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
red dot them the dot is very very bright

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.510 
red dot them the dot is very very bright
and<00:02:04.410> just<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.250> fun<00:02:05.310> here's<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.970> green<00:02:06.210> dot

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
and just for fun here's the green dot

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.770 
and just for fun here's the green dot
which<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:08.790> might<00:02:09.090> work<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.450> lot<00:02:09.600> better

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
which actually might work a lot better

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.120 
which actually might work a lot better
with<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.170> flashlight<00:02:18.650> that's<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.920> pretty

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
with this flashlight that's a pretty

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.800 
with this flashlight that's a pretty
good<00:02:20.340> fill<00:02:20.640> light<00:02:26.150> seems<00:02:27.150> pretty<00:02:27.330> far<00:02:27.600> down

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
good fill light seems pretty far down

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.400 
good fill light seems pretty far down
into<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> woods<00:02:30.170> I'm<00:02:31.170> liking<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.540> coating

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
into the woods I'm liking it the coating

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.750 
into the woods I'm liking it the coating
on<00:02:34.530> these<00:02:34.709> optics<00:02:35.160> makes<00:02:35.340> everything<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
on these optics makes everything a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.010 
on these optics makes everything a
little<00:02:35.910> darker<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.540> light<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.990> bright

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
little darker but the light is so bright

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.680 
little darker but the light is so bright
it<00:02:40.410> doesn't<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:40.800> matter<00:02:44.030> yeah<00:02:45.030> definitely

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
like the rass which i believe it's going

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.100 
like the rass which i believe it's going
to<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:10.950> perfect<00:03:11.190> because<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.510> pistol<00:03:12.930> goes

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
to be perfect because the pistol goes

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.250 
to be perfect because the pistol goes
into<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> holster<00:03:14.239> like<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.989> as<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
into the holster like this and as you

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.430 
into the holster like this and as you
can<00:03:16.410> see<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.220> big<00:03:17.519> empty<00:03:17.880> space<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.540> so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can see is a big empty space here so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.729 
can see is a big empty space here so
this<00:03:19.650> should<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.280> flop<00:03:20.850> over<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.230> cover<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
this should just flop over and cover the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.570 
this should just flop over and cover the
light<00:03:23.239> should<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.390> got<00:03:24.630> should<00:03:25.260> have<00:03:25.799> enough

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
light should have got should have enough

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.370 
light should have got should have enough
space<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.780> I've<00:03:27.930> got<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.140> right

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
