question 130 vagus nerve it arises from

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.870 
question 130 vagus nerve it arises from
the<00:00:09.890> oblongata<00:00:13.099> here<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> vagus

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the oblongata here you have the vagus

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.759 
the oblongata here you have the vagus
nerve<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> glossopharyngeal<00:00:16.080> nerve

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
nerve this is glossopharyngeal nerve

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.569 
nerve this is glossopharyngeal nerve
this<00:00:17.009> is<00:00:17.159> accessory<00:00:17.849> nerve<00:00:19.130> so<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.400> the
