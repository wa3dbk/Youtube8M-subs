00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
difficult that figure-eight is because

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.170 
difficult that figure-eight is because
you<00:05:44.770> can't<00:05:45.040> really<00:05:45.190> see<00:05:45.340> where<00:05:45.730> the<00:05:45.850> corners

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
you can't really see where the corners

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.760 
you can't really see where the corners
are<00:05:46.300> you<00:05:46.360> don't<00:05:46.600> have<00:05:46.720> anything<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.320> really

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
are you don't have anything to really

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.620 
are you don't have anything to really
gauge<00:05:48.130> your<00:05:48.160> perspective<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.390> just

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
gauge your perspective and so you just

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.110 
gauge your perspective and so you just
kind<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.900> gonna<00:05:50.080> look<00:05:50.650> for<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.920> cones<00:05:51.190> point

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
kind of gonna look for the cones point

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.640 
kind of gonna look for the cones point
their<00:05:52.300> car<00:05:52.540> in<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:52.840> direction<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.440> just

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
their car in that direction and just

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.020 
their car in that direction and just
keep<00:05:53.770> hitting<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.130> gas<00:05:54.280> till<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.640> get<00:05:54.760> there

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
keep hitting the gas till you get there

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.840 
keep hitting the gas till you get there
