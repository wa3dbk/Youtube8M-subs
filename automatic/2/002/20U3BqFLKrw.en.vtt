this<00:02:46.290> might<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.530> will<00:02:46.890> take<00:02:46.980> me<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.190> long<00:02:47.340> time

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
this might this will take me a long time

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.150 
this might this will take me a long time
and<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.060> probably<00:02:48.600> mess<00:02:48.720> up<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.500> here's<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.890> hint

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and I probably mess up but here's a hint

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
and I probably mess up but here's a hint
if<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.700> tap<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.209> pencil<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> top<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.530> if

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
if you tap the pencil at the top so if

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.320 
if you tap the pencil at the top so if
you<00:02:52.680> mess<00:02:52.890> up<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.190> line<00:02:53.370> just<00:02:53.640> tap<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.239> you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you mess up a line just tap that and you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.060 
you mess up a line just tap that and you
can<00:02:54.480> erase<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.050> lines<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.650> messed<00:02:55.860> up

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
can erase the lines that you messed up

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.560 
can erase the lines that you messed up
instead<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.370> restarting<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> whole<00:02:57.330> thing

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
instead of restarting the whole thing

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.990 
instead of restarting the whole thing
but<00:02:57.950> go<00:02:58.950> online<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.519> you'll<00:02:59.640> find<00:02:59.880> that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
but go online and you'll find that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.430 
but go online and you'll find that
because<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.660> going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.170> too<00:03:01.320> long

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
because it's going to take me too long

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.750
