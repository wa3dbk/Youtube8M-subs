 a movie was released the last of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.170
 pixar neither more nor less true today 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.990
 brave friend of the redhead girl who 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 be giving football but from haro to the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990

 they want to marry her they want her to be a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 lady a princess how are the books 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 the fairy tales by the way that is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.429
 what happens that she asks for a witch 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 who says she changed my destiny 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.660
 I want you to change certain people 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.350
 so that they do not make decisions for me the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 history 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 is really endearing in natural and there 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 one thing that I can not tell you more 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 but I swear he stole your heart 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.170
 and stops and weighs you with the year but what 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 curious because many years before a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.789
 very young people wanted to make a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 short film that almost seemed to be the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.539
 inspiration of this film that today by 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 today rampage at the box office this ladies 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.239
 intel and pay close attention because this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 I tell this animated short talk about 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.909
 to the confusion that sometimes can come 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 to be rage and hate when it clouds you 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.740
 ducts intentions are good for that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.740
 you always have to be balanced 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.280
 what the story tells is this 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.730
 medieval girl that was how to say it 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.680
 a thief was trying to get the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.900
 greater benefit to what others 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 they considered garbage or some kind of 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.090
 waste 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:41.680
 look redhead also suddenly the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 destiny placed a gift from heaven in 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.480
 this fantastic world well dragon has 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.360
 dearly beloved is a baby of 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.850
 dragon as the law of game of thrones or 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.670
 game of thrones looks somehow 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.360
 this little dragon understands that this 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 girl while hard maid on the street 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.090
 he has good intentions with him they are almost 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.170
 similar are people abandoned by 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.790
 yours 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.520
 people who lost their way 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.250
 family and between both establish a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.580
 friendship that nothing and nobody could break 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.220
 she feeds it makes this grow 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.959
 dragon baby that is according to several 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.900
 cultures one of the most creatures 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.579
 supernal who are born within the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.439
 the kingdom of the fantastic much more 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.599
 to throw fire from the mouth of 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.670
 many more about only a tremendous 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.420
 beast that threatens are supposed to be 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.159
 loaded with wisdom and that clearly 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.659
 obviously in the centuries of the first 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.450
 creatures that lived on this planet 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.650
 were recorded in the memory of 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.500
 these tremendous 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.329
 Well, as it grew, 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 transforms into a teenager this dragon 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.420
 she has to obviously teach to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.909
 save your temper because to none 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.000
 of neighbors is made in thanks that 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:02.379
 stung ten and connecting the street but 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.450
 obviously I will not find anything 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.069
 fun funny that in fact like 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.280
 said felipe and is already beginning to 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.500
 throw your first puffs of fire 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.840
 and to write insane because of some 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.879
 way the dragon recognizes that he has 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.400
 instincts that the girl has not done 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.260
 charge for it for example fly it not 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510
 can make others a human being not 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.720
 have that possibility but as good 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.710
 friend do not try to encourage him from the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.320
 higher 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.350
 left here like their weapons the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.140
 dragons fly learn together with the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.600
 others and that finally is a decision of 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.330
 he is going to accompany that horde 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.040
 of wise flying snakes with 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.860
 keep staying with them but it happens 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 something a dragon from another herd much more 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.630
 strong dangerous 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.270
 and with a character not so docile because 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.880
 has been created or has any affiliation 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.920
 with humans he has seen it with a precision 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.990
 takes it 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.380
 his lifelong friend a friend 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.750
 special if the demand does not just 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.840
 he asked dad but the dragon this 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.310
 will re-loading again and again 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.780
 imagine the anguish of being able to 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 recovered his friend but that finally 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.169
 is kidnapped by this dragon and is going to 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.739
 look to have a similar to that of 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.739
 monster 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 what happens if you ask me level to 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.169
 the girl how it grows that is changing 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.020
 well felipe for decades the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.880
 I look for say two to be exact 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.470
 twenty more years plus 18 almost 30 targeted 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.880
 is here and after having failed 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.130
 after becoming an expert in 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.160
 weapons after having raffled the 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.960
 more inhospitable places achieves something that 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.460
 clearly it looks like the lair of this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.040
 Dragon bloody murderer as tester 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.830
 flocks without permits and that even not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.930
 he had respect years ago with one of his 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.809
 own race and who attacked him only for 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.149
 be smaller 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:10.729
 exact of course a mailbox is already the 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:13.809
 giant mighty powerful hijacker 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.830
 and she's going to employ her creature 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:17.990
 still intact 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.819
 perhaps dreaming of waiting but that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.819
 there is a clear agreement 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.800
 you are going to remove my booty so easily 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.050
 she already fully trained in weapon 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.330
 until the teeth has now two 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.270
 missions not only recover your 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.500
 little friend and snatch it from this 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.910
 tremendous giant mailbox but also 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.330
 beat him since he has woken up 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.960
 discovered and eye 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.990
 beating an adult dragon is nothing 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.990
 easy 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.699
 the fight starts and obviously it's going to 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.889
 try to do everything possible if you 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.949
 they ask me what is the great impulse of 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.069
 where does it draw so much strength because clearly 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.110
 of the muscles of woman that is love 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.580
 exactly that love that a lot 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.680
 obviously mothers we have to 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.550
 apply we do not have it very clear that as 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.050
 to be inscribed in the story 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.090
 They are even able to lift a car 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.469
 complete that asks them look at the 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.360
 stability behind is doing and this 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:24.580
 bus that I have believed that I am going to take off 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.590
 today and he manages to get through it 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.240
 but they realized the attitude of 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.919
 this dragon that somehow calls her 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.080
 attention to fatigue as the 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.270
 he recognized and because he knows her very well 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.939
 felipe because actually the dragon that 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.610
 is looking for is this great 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:43.659
 the dragon grew and the little one is not 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.139
 his friend is the son or he kills his friend and he 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.139
 simply 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.570
 attention look at the idea is reflected the 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.000
 blood of my friend that I think he 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.400
 I taught myself to be a better dragon by achieving 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.280
 living with people I was not able to 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.890
 to recognize it because I was not able to 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.220
 recognize the changes in him was not of 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.620
 same size character however it was what 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.840
 I was looking for a year because I did not 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.390
 I could see it when I had it in front 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.850
 maybe many of us look for things 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.160
 and it passed us by the side how many times 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.680
 has been close what we want and not what 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.140
 and we continue to look for when and 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.470
 we have won that is about this 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.930
 short learn to see better and look no 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.180
 without anger or forgiveness not without passion 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.270
 but removing therefore the anger because 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.390
 it's going to cloud us and your friend lost 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.280
 in fact it has everything itself 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.110
 fortunately the son the son and the 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.930
 destination always allows us a second 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.820
 opportunity and obviously she knows 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.820
 look for it because the wise dragons like 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.700
 they can only read the intentions 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.440
 what we have just seen in which this 

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.180
 experimental short of a group of 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.610
 young people are based many great 

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.910
 other stories believe me that is the 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.920
 foundational is called sintel lasts almost 20 

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.810
 minutes if you want to see it whole us 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.170
 We have humbly made this short for 

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.790
 you to see if in addition to entertain us 

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:15.590
 we can also learn something we have 

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.590
 much more but what ends
