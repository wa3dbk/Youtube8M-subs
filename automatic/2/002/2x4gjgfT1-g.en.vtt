00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi everyone today i will tell about such 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.790
 automatic transmission parts 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.170
 as hydroaccumulator hydroaccumulator 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.410
 is a cylinder with a channel 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.410
 down below 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:26.039
 spring piston and top located 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.590
 the cover is also with a channel for the supply 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.369
 liquids 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.579
 what is this switch in the box 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.050
 gears occur 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.050
 hydraulic fluid first 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 hydraulic fluid acts on 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.890
 friction disc packs 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.230
 which in turn block parts 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.590
 planetary gear I'm changing 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.039
 gear ratio 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 so that's what friction discs are 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.579
 friction package and it's essentially simple 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.119
 multi-plate clutch which us 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:13.770
 known for motorcycles who had ashton 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's say this one knows what what 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.189
 happens when we throw sharply 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.810
 grip happens we push jerk 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 many say can break the grip 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.369
 to prevent this from happening in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.340
 automatic box 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.640
 there is a hydroaccumulator in fact it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.500
 pressure damper i.e. it smoothes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.500
 pressure arises it 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.450
 friction packages as it happens 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.979
 when we have pressure pressure 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.509
 valve opens and pressure from 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.200
 oil pump from the main line 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.860
 goes to the accumulator clicks on 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.110
 piston 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.399
 fluid begins to counteract 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.560
 resistance spring under 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.720
 piston 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.290
 respectively pressure fluid which 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.890
 down she perceives pressure 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.719
 already smooth i.e. spring resistance 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.040
 + pressure pressure increases under 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.939
 piston smoothly and occurs more 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.609
 smooth switching of friction discs 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:40.470
 reduced shock loads also 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:44.099
 fluid under the piston 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.950
 the piston also has a certain volume 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:53.549
 It has 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 set move this move match 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.689
 precisely the optimum compression of the friction 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.870
 drives 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:05.400
 if we directly serve directly 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.010
 oil pump pressure 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.950
 traditional disc then we 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.799
 small pressure turns will 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.260
 small at high speeds large 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.519
 respectively the degree of compression 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:24.900
 friction packages will be different also 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.599
 many have noticed that when we go with 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.500
 small speed more precisely with small 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:37.169
 Turnover switching occurs smoothly 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.060
 on there let's say on two thousand at hand with 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.709
 half a thousand revolutions here 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.849
 gear shift will occur 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.940
 smoothly and slowly if we are 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.069
 move vigorously ie eat and try 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.099
 switch at five thousand revolutions 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:57.090
 you switch will occur more 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:05.280
 in sharp form this happens due to 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:08.549
 the pressure of the oil 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.849
 pump at high speeds it is more 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.250
 accordingly, it can more quickly 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.790
 although there are milliseconds, but it 's still 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.660
 affects more quickly interact 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:28.210
 here is this spring more precisely these two 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:31.750
 spring, respectively, and switching 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.530
 will occur either more smoothly or 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.550
 more dramatically 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.550
 that's all I tried as much as possible 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 available to tell who liked 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 like it subscribe to everyone bye
