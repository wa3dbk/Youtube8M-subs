frustrate Marquez beat him at his own

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.780 
frustrate Marquez beat him at his own
game<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:12.400> did<00:01:12.550> you<00:01:13.060> know<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.330> now<00:01:13.360> he<00:01:14.229> is<00:01:14.290> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
game we did you know so now he is a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.820 
game we did you know so now he is a
better<00:01:15.790> fighter<00:01:16.120> he's<00:01:17.110> built<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.650> better

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
better fighter he's built in a better

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.539 
better fighter he's built in a better
way<00:01:18.180> his<00:01:19.180> punches<00:01:19.540> are<00:01:19.659> being<00:01:19.810> more<00:01:19.960> effective

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
way his punches are being more effective

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.710 
way his punches are being more effective
so<00:01:21.549> all<00:01:21.760> I<00:01:21.820> think<00:01:22.060> that's<00:01:22.270> that's<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.570> big

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
so all I think that's that's a big

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.810 
so all I think that's that's a big
advantage<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:24.040> mentioned<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.670> had<00:01:24.700> a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
advantage you mentioned that you had a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.940 
advantage you mentioned that you had a
hold<00:01:25.000> him<00:01:25.090> back<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.540> Marquez<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.560> given

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
hold him back with Marquez but given

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.890 
hold him back with Marquez but given
what<00:01:27.159> happened<00:01:27.340> in<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.670> first<00:01:27.850> fight<00:01:28.150> do<00:01:28.810> you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
what happened in the first fight do you

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.560 
what happened in the first fight do you
think<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.680> might<00:01:30.010> get<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.060> more<00:01:31.299> emotional

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
think that it might get a more emotional

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.240 
think that it might get a more emotional
seeing<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.380> he<00:01:32.530> wants<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.830> go<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.100> prove

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
seeing that he wants to go and prove

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.980 
seeing that he wants to go and prove
everybody<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.850> he<00:01:33.940> really<00:01:34.210> did<00:01:34.420> beat<00:01:34.780> manny

the<00:01:35.110> first<00:01:35.380> time<00:01:35.560> he<00:01:36.280> overcame<00:01:36.640> all<00:01:36.760> of<00:01:36.820> that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the first time he overcame all of that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.490 
the first time he overcame all of that
at<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:38.140> time<00:01:38.229> when<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.700> he<00:01:39.850> was<00:01:40.200> approached<00:01:41.200> in
