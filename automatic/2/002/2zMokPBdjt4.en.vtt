working<00:00:50.699> on<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:52.129> Elissa<00:00:53.129> steamer

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
working on it and I think Elissa steamer

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.780 
working on it and I think Elissa steamer
cruised<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:55.010> she<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.160> pretty<00:00:56.399> young<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
cruised up she was pretty young at the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.509 
cruised up she was pretty young at the
time<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.379> we've<00:00:58.739> never<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.070> seen

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
time you know we've never really seen

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.660 
time you know we've never really seen
that<00:01:00.000> many<00:01:00.300> girls<00:01:01.019> skaters<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.579> she

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that many girls skaters and I think she

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.600 
that many girls skaters and I think she
did<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.879> first<00:01:03.180> try<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.229> Tim<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.739> after<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
did it first try and Tim just after that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
did it first try and Tim just after that
point<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.090> he<00:01:06.560> retired<00:01:07.560> from<00:01:07.740> skates

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
point I think he retired from skates

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.600 
point I think he retired from skates
from<00:01:08.490> skateboarding<00:01:09.050> seriously<00:01:10.050> he's<00:01:10.610> just

put<00:03:33.130> together<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.490> 60-second<00:03:34.480> run<00:03:34.630> which<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.590> was

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
put together a 60-second run which I was

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.150 
put together a 60-second run which I was
never<00:03:36.160> ever<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.300> good<00:03:37.959> at<00:03:38.110> maybe<00:03:38.830> made

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
never ever really a good at maybe made

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.949 
never ever really a good at maybe made
the<00:03:39.280> finals<00:03:39.760> squeaked<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.330> there<00:03:40.510> somehow<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the finals squeaked in there somehow I

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.270 
the finals squeaked in there somehow I
don't<00:03:41.260> know<00:03:41.380> yeah<00:03:41.830> it's<00:03:42.130> always

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
don't know yeah it's always

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:50.390 
don't know yeah it's always
nerve-racking

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.580 

if<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.940> was<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.269> everyone<00:03:51.690> knows<00:03:51.900> each<00:03:52.080> other

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
if it was this everyone knows each other

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.030 
if it was this everyone knows each other
yeah<00:03:53.580> this<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.930> small<00:03:55.470> community<00:03:55.769> and

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
yeah this it's a small community and

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.880 
yeah this it's a small community and
everyone<00:03:56.629> knows<00:03:57.629> each<00:03:57.900> other<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.230> think<00:03:58.500> that's

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
everyone knows each other I think that's

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.750 
everyone knows each other I think that's
what<00:03:59.040> makes<00:03:59.750> different

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.830 

the<00:04:04.940> last<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.660> dying<00:04:05.870> breed<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.349> contest<00:04:07.840> the
