 jaime a question that study did not have 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.450
 comment affection good once 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.160
 explanations of the origin of ceviche are 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.590
 suppose it is that the fishermen in their 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.000
 boats feeling hungry cut 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.769
 the raw fish was a little 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.959
 of lemon what they had at hand 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.390
 develops and so is supposed to be born 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.050
 our Peruvian ceviche tradition that 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.050
 until now others 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.680
 because the fishermen are winning something 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.690
 because he is 21 years old for the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.700
 sinners and humanity there was a little bit 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.700
 of sin 30 and 40 kilos 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.670

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.830

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.390
 they have disappeared that have shrunk 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.540

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.180
 a moved strikes streams weird 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.970
 wind if there are some chefs that are 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.820
 worried about the black shells they say 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.880

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.020

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.710
