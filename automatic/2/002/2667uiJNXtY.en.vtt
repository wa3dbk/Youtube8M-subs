think I'd do that because I think to do

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.530 
think I'd do that because I think to do
that<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.870> really<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.560> wrong<00:02:55.800> um<00:02:56.540> so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
that is just really really wrong um so
