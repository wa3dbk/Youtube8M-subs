with those guns I've been trying to get
nukes<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.390> other<00:01:42.509> guns<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> man<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.289> just

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
nukes with other guns and man it's just

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.170 
nukes with other guns and man it's just
difficult<00:01:44.299> I'm<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
difficult I'm just not that good at it

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.719 
difficult I'm just not that good at it
but<00:01:48.180> yet<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.590> rank<00:01:50.549> wise

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
but yet so you can see here rank wise

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.709 
but yet so you can see here rank wise
I'm<00:01:51.860> 500,000<00:01:52.860> somewhere<00:01:53.369> around<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.789> and

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
I'm 500,000 somewhere around there and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.279 
I'm 500,000 somewhere around there and
my<00:01:54.930> KD<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.789> point<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:58.049> you

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
my KD was only one point for two as you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.859 
my KD was only one point for two as you
can<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.070> eyes<00:01:59.460> streak<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.270> 44

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
can see right here my eyes streak is 44

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.200 
can see right here my eyes streak is 44
and<00:02:00.899> that's<00:02:01.289> legit<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.060> don't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and that's legit and then I don't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.849 
and that's legit and then I don't
understand<00:02:03.539> why<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> accuracy<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.200> negative

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
understand why the accuracy is negative

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.349 
understand why the accuracy is negative
I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.609> went<00:02:05.939> over<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
I think it's because I went over the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.540 
I think it's because I went over the
number<00:02:06.659> because<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:08.070> automatically

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
number because I was automatically

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.650 
number because I was automatically
thinking<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:08.970> hacked<00:02:09.209> or<00:02:09.390> something

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
thinking I was hacked or something

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
thinking I was hacked or something
because<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.200> went<00:02:10.500> negative<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.099> should

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
because it went negative and it should

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.220 
because it went negative and it should
be<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.700> high<00:02:11.849> consuming<00:02:12.390> i<00:02:12.480> use<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> m16

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
be really high consuming i use the m16

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.820 
be really high consuming i use the m16

spinning icon i believe that's from the
ac-130<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.950> get<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.610> like<00:03:05.700> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
ac-130 you get that if you get like a
