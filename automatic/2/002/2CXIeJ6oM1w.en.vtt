00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.300
 what about my glory bodies the spotlight 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.680
 with a new video for you and in 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.629
 this biology teach because some 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.759
 people can very well develop their 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.099
 calves and other people can not 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.740
 well, there is something called a tendon 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.480
 Achilles and they are like leagues that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.630
 we have in our ours 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 feet that run from the calves 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.089
 up to the feet then the people who 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
 they have long Achilles meetings 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.160
 they can run faster an example of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.770
 this would be usain bolt see your tendons 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 of Achilles as he has them very very long 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.719
 and their calves have them very much 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 up then your legs are made 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.770
 for running 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.230
 there is a problem with this since 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.520
 we have long Achilles tendons a 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.559
 of the people that we have tendons of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.300
 long achilles we can not develop 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.220
 good calves and you can see it here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.809
 next does not have good 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.129
 calves 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.140
 but his achilles tendons are very 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.739
 long which makes it very good for 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.540
 run then every time we work 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 our calves the people that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.610
 we have long achilles tendons all 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.500
 the work goes straight to the tendons 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.500
 from Achilles instead of towards 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.509
 calves are like some leagues and they are 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.790
 those who receive all the work instead 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.440
 of our calves that's why some 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.320
 people can not develop too 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.810
 his calves because there is not much 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.300
 muscle that will form and why the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.470
 achilles tendons are hogging him 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 all that muscle 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 that all that area where it should be 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 that muscle occupy all the space and in 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.270
 the calves are very high as 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.380
 to develop well an example of 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 this would be one of the best 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.100
 bodybuilders that there are right now that there 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.230
 now in the bodybuilding business and 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.300
 see your calves have tendons of 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.070
 Achilles long and does not have calves 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.950
 can see their cons and there's no 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.370
 Calves compare them with their 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.369
 its this femoral is to compare those 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.130
 controls things moral fu there is nothing or 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.070
 be the mass you have and for example in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.030
 a photo that is frontal and a pose 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.800
 front of your calf 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.319
 Ivan is ridiculous there is no calf 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.189
 there 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.370
 so if you do not want to believe me either 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:27.430
 this look at robbie coleman the cursor is 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.650
 the bodybuilder who previously owned the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.469
 bodybuilder that I put previously you 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.510
 Always see your calves training 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.430
 but you never see yourself growing just 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.469
 they stay there the same with rum and coleman see 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.079
 the muscle mass that has processes 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.819
 how many kings are not there an example 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.700
 that would be the only slogan not to the right 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.919
 dorian gates on the left go to the mass 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.260
 muscle of how rich German is a lot is 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.840
 very much superior to the mass of Oran 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.579
 gates but the calves of oria in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.189
 jets as he has achilles tendons 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.219
 short films can develop very well 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.680
 calves and rony coleman not to the 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.689
 right well your calves despite 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.359
 who have higher muscle mass doi 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.530
 English has superior calves 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.409
 because ronnie coleman is made for 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.069
 run see this photo below 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.430
 this very famous bodybuilder nowadays 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.499
 and you can see that even though the dough 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.530
 coleman muscular rum and that they 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:26.409
 he has just taught that he is superior 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.599
 this man weighs up to 80 pounds less 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.959
 but not coleman but his calves 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.000
 they are superior because their 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.870
 achilles tendons are shorter can 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.349
 generate more muscle mass there well this 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.349
 another photo 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.080
 can see how your calves are 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.060
 very well developed and can see 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.130
 also that his achilles tendons are 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.130
 very very short 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.500
 then that means that tendons of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.069
 Achilles short is equal to calves 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.069
 big 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.050
 the problem with these people is that they do not 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.110
 they are very good that to run they are not 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.940
 made for running and here an example of 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.100
 three different people of three 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.019
 different bodybuilders and can 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.359
 see that the shorter the nude is 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.630
 Achilles more are developed 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.630
 calves 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.020
 but then you will have said to 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.900
 this moment then if I have tendons 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.270
 of long achilles I can not develop 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.500
 good calves because the truth is 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.599
 that if they can develop good 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.860
 calves but they will never be able 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.699
 development in the calves that are 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.080
 Monstrous extremely amazing no 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.340
 less than taking out an operation that is 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.099
 to put an implant in there is a type 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.900
 gelatin a silicone to be able to put 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.069
 space and a lot the muscle that is not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.470
 develops and will make them their 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.330
 calves look bigger by 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.099
 example below see that this 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.220
 man has got achilles tendon 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.900
 long but after if trained 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.870
 several years your calves if you're 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.280
 constant in internal patients 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.470
 for years your calves and you're 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.630
 patient will develop as it was to 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.699
 below and you can see that it has 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.050
 Achilles tendons long but not like that 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.990
 has decent calves 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.380
 worked because of the perseverance and 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.139
 patience will not grow huge but 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.360
 they have decent calves 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.909
 So if you want to learn a routine 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.800
 good for calves can enter 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.259
 this link here below for 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.000
 that follow this good routine I hope they 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.560
 I liked it, I hope you answered 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.969
 many of your questions 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.539
 continue to be sexy they are still hungry and not 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.539
 stop training
