next step so we'll click Next and it's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.340 
next step so we'll click Next and it's
gonna<00:01:38.100> set<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:39.350> it'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
gonna set it up there it'll

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
gonna set it up there it'll

and<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.130> still<00:02:15.340> looking<00:02:15.760> it's<00:02:16.690> gonna<00:02:16.810> join

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
and it's still looking it's gonna join

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.670 
and it's still looking it's gonna join
it<00:02:17.320> because<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:18.310> found<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:25.230> all<00:02:26.230> right<00:02:26.290> there

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it because it's found it all right there

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.320 
it because it's found it all right there

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
goes so the green light means is

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.840 
goes so the green light means is
operating<00:02:28.930> correctly<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.340> found<00:02:30.580> mine

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
operating correctly and it's found mine

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.210 
operating correctly and it's found mine
catches<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> internet<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.950> about<00:02:33.190> it
