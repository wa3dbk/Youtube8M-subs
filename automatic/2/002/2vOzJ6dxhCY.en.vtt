which is about six miles from the
Canadian<00:01:55.930> border<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:56.920> very<00:01:57.130> cold<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.610> the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
Canadian border so it's very cold in the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.450 
Canadian border so it's very cold in the
wintertime<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.780> what<00:01:59.020> we<00:01:59.260> do<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.560> we<00:02:00.010> utilize

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
wintertime so what we do is we utilize

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.090 
wintertime so what we do is we utilize
all<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.820> shavings<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.840> sawdust<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:02.979> use

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
all the shavings and the sawdust we use

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.740 
all the shavings and the sawdust we use
from<00:02:03.250> building<00:02:03.550> our<00:02:03.670> windows<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.510> use

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
from building our windows that we use

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.800 
from building our windows that we use
that<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.740> material<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.370> heat<00:02:07.000> our<00:02:07.210> facility

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
that the material to heat our facility

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
that the material to heat our facility
in<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.990> wintertime<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.250> we're<00:02:09.399> able<00:02:09.550> to

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
in the wintertime and so we're able to

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.170 
in the wintertime and so we're able to
basically<00:02:10.330> use<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.340> all<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> pieces<00:02:12.879> of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
basically use all of all the pieces of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.830 
basically use all of all the pieces of
the<00:02:13.269> wood<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the wood that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.990 
the wood that
that<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.470> get<00:02:14.620> used<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
that don't get used in in the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.460 
that don't get used in in the
manufacturing<00:02:16.629> we<00:02:16.780> use<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.110> reheat<00:02:17.349> our

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
manufacturing we use it to reheat our

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.589 
manufacturing we use it to reheat our
plant<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.190> wintertime<00:02:18.400> okay<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.330> what

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
plant in the wintertime okay so what

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.270 
plant in the wintertime okay so what
type<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> our<00:02:20.080> values<00:02:20.319> are<00:02:20.620> associated<00:02:21.190> with
