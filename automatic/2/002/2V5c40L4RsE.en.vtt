00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.669
 hello again friends looks at this 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.080
 video we are going to check with the cop 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.200
 one piece with one all 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.140
 boilers well is the clip are security 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.930
 or over temperature is an element that 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.750
 avoids that there are major problems 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 as 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.970
 is designed for when it is rising 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 the temperature excessively so not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 stop us the boiler does not stop being a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.460
 little bridge but it is an element of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.590
 security because very effective can us 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 act for different reasons can be 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 they are wrong the same the same 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.290
 device or it could also be that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.300
 there would be an airbag in the boiler 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.600
 it could also be that the circulator 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.850
 do not move us because it is wrong or 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.690
 because he is caught you do not know anymore 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 you remember how to unblock the circulate 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.610
 doors and is grabbed we remove the plug 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.589
 quoted and we move with him with the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.229
 screwdriver this can happen to us 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.440
 when long seasons pass 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.910
 boiler to see however let's see 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.850
 how to check in a very 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.070
 simple the floor like the metro in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.369
 this series of videos multimeters like 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.450
 you want to call it good so let's go 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.700
 on the part we are going to locate this system 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.250
 we have it here you know how good this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.250
 no longer a chassis of a boiler 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.010
 It is not in the exchanger but good 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.680
 we locate you see him here 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.680
 well let's take it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.980
 good 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.910
 if you look at this case 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.640
 because it is automatic it warms up a little and it 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.260
 active once it has cooled 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.300
 automatically he rearms 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.100
 different is the case of this other friends 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.540
 I do not know if you see him 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.610
 and we check 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.259
 how do we check with the cop 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.259
 metro look at we put 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.850
 in continuity it is worth 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.850
 look 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.480
 pita therefore is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 working correctly polymeter 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.620
 let's see in this case then the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.620
 floor safety thermostat 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.470
 and that is also why we have 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 the bridge made we are going to make a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.780
 small test I'm going to approach the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.430
 camera 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.700
 to see if it's true that he acts 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.700
 correctly 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.710
 look 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.060
 you can not see him there 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.060
 you can s approach me a little bit more 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.020
 I invite you here not to blur us 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.810
 It would be good 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.120
 ravine is worth watching the test we're going 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.670
 to do is going to go know how the whistle goes up 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.069
 ring when it expands and when there is a 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 about temperature , you'll even see it 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.150
 as clicks look 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.879
 you heard it and you have not seen how it goes up 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:26.650
 right now there should not be 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.650
 continuity let's see 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.940
 when it gets cold, this is the one that 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.940
 we have to manually reset 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.720
 6 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.610
 who would not be right now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.820
 making the bridge is the element of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.680
 security let's let it cool 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.680
 and let's check what is automatic 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.340
 this we put it backwards to go 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.340
 cooling 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.610
 you see 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.930
 you see 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.930
 the automatic I do not know if the spill 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.850
 ok let's do it in the same test 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.980
 it's worth with the automatic 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.010
 and so we give time for the other to leave 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.490
 cooling 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.880
 and this we are going to listen to, we are going to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.790
 feel like it dilates there is good we go 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.790
 a little bit later we can hear it 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.580
 but of course tito rey does not jump 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.580
 because this is automatic 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.589
 it's ok to jump, let's check 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.120
 no pita 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.090
 let's see if the other already cold 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.440
 of rearmam what you see 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.380
 it has already cooled 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.900
 you have heard it already demonstrating the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.960
 another one because it has been rearmed automatically 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.790
 Now once we check we should 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.380
 to whistle again we should have 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.450
 continuity 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.450
 but you have a friend 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.610
 so we would have to wait too 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.610
 to which the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
 getting cold 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.039
 let's see it 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.250
 more than this real mauto matiko cools 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.250
 she is seen and I had to press 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.330
 and added friends because it's a very 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.150
 simple to check an item that is 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.420
 Well, something extraordinary for the 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.210
 boiler and all safety 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.600
 we so I say goodbye to you 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:21.140
 you have seen I put in continuity and 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:25.070
 how the device whistled once 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.410
 the current passes us makes us do 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.420
 bridge reading friends I hope so 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.940
 that this video you have always liked 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.550
 to have the utmost caution of 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.820
 disconnect the boiler take care 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.280
 with all the tests you do and then 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.950
 then the relevant as we always say 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.810
 combustion analysis for friends but 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.800
 nothing say goodbye to you that you have 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.800
 a good day chao
