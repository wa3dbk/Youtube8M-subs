00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.220 
this is going to flush out nicely I
think<00:03:07.730> my<00:03:08.730> my<00:03:09.120> further<00:03:09.420> plans<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.050> make

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
think my my further plans are to make

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.400 
think my my further plans are to make
more<00:03:10.830> walls<00:03:11.190> make<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> couple<00:03:12.510> small<00:03:12.720> towers

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
more walls make a couple small towers

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.670 
more walls make a couple small towers
not<00:03:14.100> as<00:03:14.460> big<00:03:14.670> as<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> obviously<00:03:15.450> but<00:03:16.320> you

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
not as big as this obviously but you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.229 
not as big as this obviously but you
know<00:03:16.770> that<00:03:17.070> will<00:03:17.190> support<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.060> give<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
know that will support that and give it

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.940 
know that will support that and give it
a<00:03:18.360> couple<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.950> angle<00:03:19.950> possibilities<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:21.450> go<00:03:21.600> on

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
a couple of angle possibilities to go on

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
a couple of angle possibilities to go on
so<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:24.239> starting<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.570> shape<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:24.959> starting<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so it's starting to shape up starting to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.130 
so it's starting to shape up starting to
look<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:26.000> how<00:03:27.000> old<00:03:27.030> battle<00:03:27.420> table<00:03:27.750> should<00:03:27.930> in

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
look like how old battle table should in

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.860 
look like how old battle table should in
