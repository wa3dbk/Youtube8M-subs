00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.730
 I hope you are very well in this case 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.120
 I'm going to show you a little tutorial 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.320
 how to make a small farm of souls 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.379
 or how to get souls pretty fast 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.170
 how to advance in the good game is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.820
 too easy besides that if you want 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.559
 get for example more than light you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.950
 you can end up getting in addition to 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:35.440
 then it ends up getting the mold 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.940
 of the biome that the most serious god let him 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.380
 web very well, this is very easy 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.340
 we have to build a small biome 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 artificial 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.699
 of this meteorite below the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.850
 surface not so down but if very 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.720
 below so that we are sure of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.480
 that will fall 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.600
 so as you will have seen in the I have 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.600
 immunity 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.480
 this eye 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.480
 stay 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.740
 very well 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.030
 so we do not need 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.030
 what do I know about 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.020
 with 77 one more is enough with a hundred and al 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 final or astral 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 so we have a here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.090
 as if everything looks 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:57.880
 how are we going to see if the language is already 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.880
 done or not is or is wrong as it would be 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.090
 it's easy to identify if you're well done 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.469
 since if it is badly done 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.469
 the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.440
 the typical 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.200
 that appear in this meteorite that 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.200
 they are the heads of the meteorite 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.100
 and if it is well done then one arrives 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 It is not a 100% that sells us at dinners 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:41.780
 but that's why we implemented the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.780
 the possibility making 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.600
 governess 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.850
 enemies 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.050
 in that language so they do not loose 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.050
 that type d 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.330
 the things that we want 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.330
 so I voted for here 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.319
 one 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.890
 corruption 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.360
 as corruption 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.360
 like this with 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.840
 guardian 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.190
 how we have it here 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.190
 we see that they are good 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.770
 corruption 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.770
 as expected now 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.360
 here it would be 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.550
 what would be 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 much that is standing 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.080
 or is another type 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.990
 so that we can fall weapons 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.500
 so what 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.370
 slowly 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.370
 Of course we can 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.729
 the appearance of enemies 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.030
 since I do not know 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.460
 it is many 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.430
 meteorite things that are not going to 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.680
 lack 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.980
 the souls have to have more patience from 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.980
 whatever 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.740
 it is clear that they also need 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.450
 in 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.250
 until they start arriving 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.250
 and you 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.000
 4 minutes 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.500
 and 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.780
 that would be a 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.780
 of getting from world 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.960
 let's say that kind of biome 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.870
 until it arrives 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.870
 the battle position that is would increase 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.490
 too much of him 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.270
 and that would be the same as having the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.730
 possibilities of 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.730
 of 1 mold and 2 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.880
 Well, what they are looking for would be him 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.690
 the souls 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.760
 and good to keep doing this 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.139
 For a long time 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.810
 until I get 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:57.260
 a 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:03.040
 until they begin to leave souls this 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.040
 It can sometimes take up to 5 minutes 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.610
 but how 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.020
 As you can see, there are too many enemies 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.830
 Well, sometimes 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.830
 in order 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:26.169
 but those people I hope that they have 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:29.499
 liked if it was like this this 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:32.139
 in the little hand up and you know 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:34.760
 share it with your friends 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:38.830
 so that more people can 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.830
 and remove that doubt of how 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.650
 how will they get more much faster 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.659
 in this state goodbye people
