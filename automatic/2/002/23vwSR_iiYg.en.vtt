fire<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.810> get<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.110> red<00:03:01.319> beam<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
fire you get this red beam that the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.130 
fire you get this red beam that the
opponents<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.209> opponents<00:03:03.450> get<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.989> you

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
opponents that the opponents get for you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080 
opponents that the opponents get for you
so<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.739> see<00:03:04.920> your<00:03:05.040> line<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.340> fire<00:03:05.580> that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so they can see your line of fire that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.210 
so they can see your line of fire that
your<00:03:06.239> cone<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.690> fire<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.470> also<00:03:07.590> seems<00:03:07.950> that

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
your cone of fire and it also seems that

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.430 
your cone of fire and it also seems that
when<00:03:08.610> she<00:03:09.390> aims<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.870> more<00:03:10.019> she<00:03:10.140> likes<00:03:10.350> she

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
when she aims the more she likes she

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.840 
when she aims the more she likes she
calms<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.950> breath<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.640> know<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
calms of breath the you know the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.460 
calms of breath the you know the
targeting<00:03:12.329> circle<00:03:12.720> gets<00:03:12.810> small<00:03:13.140> until<00:03:13.380> it's

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
targeting circle gets small until it's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.229 
targeting circle gets small until it's
like<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> pinpoint<00:03:13.890> where<00:03:14.670> she's<00:03:14.850> going<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.030> aim

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
like a pinpoint where she's going to aim

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.880 
like a pinpoint where she's going to aim
so<00:03:15.420> i<00:03:15.450> guess<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> spread<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.829> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
so i guess that's like the spread so you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.530 
so i guess that's like the spread so you
reduce<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> spread<00:03:17.610> by<00:03:17.880> an<00:03:18.000> increasing<00:03:18.450> of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
reduce the spread by an increasing of

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
reduce the spread by an increasing of
breathing<00:03:18.959> or<00:03:19.200> decreasing<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.799> breathing<00:03:20.130> rate

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
breathing or decreasing a breathing rate

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.550 
breathing or decreasing a breathing rate
you<00:03:20.610> know<00:03:20.700> luring<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.150> heart<00:03:21.390> rate<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.260> she

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
you know luring a heart rate and she

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.599 
you know luring a heart rate and she
seems<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.829> be<00:03:22.859> very<00:03:22.920> good<00:03:23.160> at<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.459> that's

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
seems to be very good at that and that's

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.370 
seems to be very good at that and that's
why<00:03:23.700> she's<00:03:23.850> with<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.570> renowned<00:03:25.230> is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
why she's with the one the renowned is

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.740 
why she's with the one the renowned is
one<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> best<00:03:25.829> snipers<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.220> GGO<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.299> yeah

guy<00:04:21.440> ran<00:04:21.739> slower<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.669> that's<00:04:22.850> kind<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.120> nice<00:04:23.240> to

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
guy ran slower so that's kind of nice to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.850 
guy ran slower so that's kind of nice to
see<00:04:23.600> it's<00:04:23.750> kind<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.930> like<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.470> hardcore

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
see it's kind of like in the hardcore

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.550 
see it's kind of like in the hardcore
mode<00:04:25.039> and<00:04:25.220> fallout<00:04:25.400> new<00:04:25.520> vegas<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:27.470> yeah

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
mode and fallout new vegas and so yeah

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.749 
mode and fallout new vegas and so yeah
there<00:04:27.800> seems<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.070> be<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> really<00:04:28.370> well-built

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
there seems to be a really well-built

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.730 
there seems to be a really well-built
out<00:04:29.000> game<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.690> also<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.229> know<00:04:30.350> with<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.500> cone

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
out game and also you know with the cone

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.379 
out game and also you know with the cone
of<00:04:30.770> fire<00:04:30.949> that<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.639> red<00:04:31.820> beam<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.270> you're

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
of fire that the red beam if you're

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.640 
of fire that the red beam if you're
stuck<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.780> red<00:04:32.990> beaten<00:04:33.289> when<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> guy

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
stuck in the red beaten when that guy

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.990 
stuck in the red beaten when that guy
with<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.830> minigun<00:04:34.130> pulls<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.520> trigger<00:04:34.550> you're

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
with a minigun pulls the trigger you're

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.090 
with a minigun pulls the trigger you're
pretty<00:04:35.150> much<00:04:35.210> screwed<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.710> think<00:04:36.770> that's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
pretty much screwed and I think that's

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.010 
pretty much screwed and I think that's

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
the guy with a minigun the big guy with

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.339 
the guy with a minigun the big guy with
big<00:04:55.430> cape<00:04:55.699> managed<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.330> dodge<00:04:56.509> her<00:04:56.780> first<00:04:57.050> shot

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
big cape managed to dodge her first shot

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.230 
big cape managed to dodge her first shot
at<00:04:57.380> him<00:04:57.710> because<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.490> know<00:04:58.580> she'd<00:04:58.789> given<00:04:59.030> away

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
at him because you know she'd given away

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.089 
at him because you know she'd given away
a<00:04:59.270> position<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.229> then<00:05:00.349> there<00:05:00.470> was<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.620> red<00:05:00.860> beam

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
a position so then there was a red beam

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.260 
a position so then there was a red beam
so<00:05:01.370> then<00:05:01.490> he<00:05:01.550> could<00:05:01.580> just<00:05:01.820> move<00:05:01.940> out<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
so then he could just move out of the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.120 
so then he could just move out of the
way<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.539> it<00:05:02.660> though<00:05:03.259> I<00:05:03.289> think<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.650> reactions

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
way of it though I think the reactions

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.490 
way of it though I think the reactions
of<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.669> seeing<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.449> red<00:05:05.599> beam<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:05.930> dodging<00:05:06.380> it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
of you seeing a red beam and dodging it

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.499 
of you seeing a red beam and dodging it
in<00:05:06.620> time<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.860> dodge<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.220> 50<00:05:07.639> caliber<00:05:07.849> you<00:05:08.389> know

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
in time to dodge a 50 caliber you know

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.710 
in time to dodge a 50 caliber you know
bullet<00:05:09.259> from<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.800> sniper<00:05:09.949> rifle<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.639> a<00:05:10.669> bit<00:05:10.940> but

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
bullet from a sniper rifle is a bit but

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.120 
bullet from a sniper rifle is a bit but
I<00:05:11.750> guess<00:05:11.960> their<00:05:12.169> reaction<00:05:12.500> times<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.830> EDX<00:05:12.949> is

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
I guess their reaction times of EDX is

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.339 
I guess their reaction times of EDX is
in<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.340> video<00:05:13.580> game<00:05:13.610> point<00:05:14.509> being<00:05:14.750> freakin
