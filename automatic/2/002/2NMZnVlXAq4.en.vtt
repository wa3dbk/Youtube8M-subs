00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
exactly what it looks like so going down

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.479 
exactly what it looks like so going down
like<00:02:22.299> this<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.780> you're<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.989> fan<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.739> red<00:02:24.159> dwarf

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
like this if you're a fan of red dwarf

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.000 
like this if you're a fan of red dwarf
and<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:26.590> pretty<00:02:26.829> much<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.889> we<00:02:29.889> have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
and that's pretty much it and we have

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.129 
and that's pretty much it and we have
the<00:02:30.129> map<00:02:30.370> spotlight<00:02:30.939> this<00:02:31.569> week<00:02:31.629> we're

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
the map spotlight this week we're

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.990 
the map spotlight this week we're
looking<00:02:32.349> at<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.560> superstar<00:02:33.219> series<00:02:33.639> and<00:02:33.879> in

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
looking at the superstar series and in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.149 
looking at the superstar series and in
particular<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.719> me<00:02:34.900> I'm<00:02:35.139> playing<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
particular for me I'm playing the the

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.929 
particular for me I'm playing the the
infernal<00:02:36.730> sky<00:02:37.030> one<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.019> there's<00:02:38.920> seven<00:02:39.730> maps

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
infernal sky one so there's seven maps

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.780 
infernal sky one so there's seven maps
in<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.299> series<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.650> basic<00:02:42.129> aim<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.670> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
in this series and the basic aim of the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.110 
in this series and the basic aim of the
maps<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.810> create<00:02:44.109> a<00:02:44.139> really<00:02:44.769> hard

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
maps is to create a really hard

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.929 
maps is to create a really hard
challenging<00:02:46.349> map<00:02:47.349> series<00:02:47.919> to<00:02:48.220> push<00:02:48.549> the

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
challenging map series to push the

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.569 
challenging map series to push the
players<00:02:49.209> boundaries<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.139> this<00:02:51.099> map<00:02:51.370> in

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
players boundaries and this map in

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.479 
players boundaries and this map in
particular<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.599> start<00:02:53.019> out<00:02:53.200> yet<00:02:53.859> there's

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
particular you start out yet there's

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.599 
particular you start out yet there's
loads<00:02:54.879> of<00:02:55.060> drops<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.709> pretty<00:02:57.189> hard

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
loads of drops and it's like pretty hard

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.490 
loads of drops and it's like pretty hard
to<00:02:57.849> get<00:02:57.969> to<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> tree<00:02:58.480> which<00:02:58.689> has<00:02:58.719> wood<00:02:59.230> in<00:02:59.349> it

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
to get to the tree which has wood in it

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.039 
to get to the tree which has wood in it
so<00:03:00.340> that's<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.269> first<00:03:01.419> things<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.840> do

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
so that's one of the first things you do

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.830 
so that's one of the first things you do
on<00:03:02.169> this<00:03:02.319> map<00:03:02.620> there's<00:03:03.219> also<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.510> sea<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
on this map there's also the sea of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.709 
on this map there's also the sea of
flames<00:03:05.200> which<00:03:06.159> is<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.549> solve<00:03:07.329> lights<00:03:07.540> of

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
flames which is like solve lights of

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.709 
flames which is like solve lights of
Oliver<00:03:07.989> islands<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:08.769> you're<00:03:09.069> not<00:03:09.189> in<00:03:09.310> water

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
Oliver islands but you're not in water

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.289 
Oliver islands but you're not in water
surrounded<00:03:10.719> by<00:03:10.810> lava<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:12.489> also<00:03:13.269> the
