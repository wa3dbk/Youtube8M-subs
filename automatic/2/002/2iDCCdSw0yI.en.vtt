00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
well back moment it's because it's in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.370 
well back moment it's because it's in
space<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.660> play<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> in

space and you you play a like it in
space<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.369> has<00:01:41.580> gravity<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.210> stuff

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.359

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.209 
so of course no lag or anything you can
play<00:01:54.670> just<00:01:54.850> like<00:01:55.060> normal<00:01:55.390> birds<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.950> because

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
play just like normal birds it's because

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.310 
play just like normal birds it's because
it's<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.549> smaller<00:01:57.969> game<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.840> don't<00:01:58.930> do<00:01:59.140> that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
it's a smaller game you don't do that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's a smaller game you don't do that
much<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.079> it's<00:02:05.259> quite<00:02:05.409> fun<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.920> would<00:02:06.130> say<00:02:06.310> ask

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.910 
much and it's quite fun I would say ask
you<00:02:06.880> see<00:02:07.030> over<00:02:07.240> there<00:02:07.410> it's<00:02:08.410> quite<00:02:08.500> hard<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
you see over there it's quite hard to

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:22.470 
you see over there it's quite hard to
get<00:02:09.069> out<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.580> bubble<00:02:09.819> as<00:02:10.119> well<00:02:21.480> let's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
get out of that bubble as well let's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:36.479 
get out of that bubble as well let's
play<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> next<00:02:23.049> level<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:36.310> did

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
play the next level see here they did

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.720 
play the next level see here they did
them<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.650> affects<00:02:39.040> how<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.280> game<00:02:39.489> is

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
them all this affects how the game is

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.490 
them all this affects how the game is
think<00:02:40.120> there's<00:02:40.299> like<00:02:40.480> 60<00:02:40.870> levels<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.380> can

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
think there's like 60 levels you can

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.699 
think there's like 60 levels you can
find<00:02:41.650> secret<00:02:42.010> levels<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.459> well<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:44.470> those

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
find secret levels as well and all those
