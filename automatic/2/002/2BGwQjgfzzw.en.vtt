00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
what's up guys so growing up here in
Phoenix<00:00:03.210> I<00:00:03.449> rode<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.230> BMX<00:00:04.950> bike<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.370> lot<00:00:05.580> i<00:00:06.299> think

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
Phoenix I rode my BMX bike a lot i think

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.930 
Phoenix I rode my BMX bike a lot i think
as<00:00:07.020> early<00:00:07.379> as<00:00:07.560> may<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.340> fourth<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:08.760> fifth

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
as early as may be the fourth or fifth

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.879 
as early as may be the fourth or fifth
grade<00:00:09.360> we'd<00:00:09.690> ride<00:00:09.900> our<00:00:09.929> bikes<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.410> couple<00:00:10.679> miles

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
grade we'd ride our bikes a couple miles

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.360 
grade we'd ride our bikes a couple miles
to<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.969> nearest<00:00:12.500> dirt<00:00:13.500> lot<00:00:13.710> where<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.160> built

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
to the nearest dirt lot where we built

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.790 
to the nearest dirt lot where we built
jumps<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.750> i<00:00:15.900> moved<00:00:16.109> around<00:00:16.320> we'd<00:00:16.680> always

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
jumps and as i moved around we'd always

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
jumps and as i moved around we'd always
find<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> best<00:00:17.670> place<00:00:17.940> their<00:00:18.869> jumps<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.260> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
find the best place their jumps and I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.470 
find the best place their jumps and I
think<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.920> farthest<00:00:20.369> i<00:00:20.460> would<00:00:20.609> ride<00:00:20.850> would<00:00:21.330> be

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
think the farthest i would ride would be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
think the farthest i would ride would be
like<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.080> four<00:00:22.109> miles<00:00:22.880> spend<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> whole

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
like three or four miles spend the whole

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
like three or four miles spend the whole
day<00:00:24.240> riding<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.230> jump<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> ride<00:00:26.039> through

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
day riding and jump in and ride through

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
day riding and jump in and ride through
four<00:00:26.490> miles<00:00:26.640> back<00:00:26.820> home<00:00:27.230> obviously<00:00:28.230> I'm<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> lot

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
four miles back home obviously I'm a lot

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.189 
four miles back home obviously I'm a lot
older<00:00:28.470> now<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.830> bmxing<00:00:29.609> isn't<00:00:29.640> quite<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.779> style

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
