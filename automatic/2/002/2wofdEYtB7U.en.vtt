00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good to all kids sidi mario 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.720
 let's start career career mode 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.040
 as a manager that someone asked me to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.269
 go up in career mode 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.019
 let's see it go up a bit so 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.750
 career 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.210
 I'm going to take the chelsea for example from 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.040
 mourinho 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.040
 that has paste to sign and everything roll 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.759
 here you have all the options legend 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.779
 the duration of each part we are going to 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.829
 put 6 minutillos peaks or financial 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.070
 idea 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.030
 let's leave it as it is currency euros 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.000
 used templates 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.870
 most recent downloads better 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 European competition the first season 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.379
 A) Yes 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 walk 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.420
 to complete the draw 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.940
 oh well this is the champions cup was the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.580
 champions and we have euroliga that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.290
 He started the Europa League obviously 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.330
 well then I will prepare well then 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.380
 the groups of the champions and now 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.380
 I continue with the video 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.330
 good we take the video as you see already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.850
 I have the groups of the champions the bad 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.830
 is that in group g I have not been able to put 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 the last team and in the last 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.409
 team that were I put other random 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.820
 here one dutch and here one french me 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.860
 it seems but good the rest is everything 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.540
 all right 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.580
 the equal league has left such 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 what this gives me a little more like this 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.540
 how good are we going to be 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.909
 we activate that the first one is ignored 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.520
 summer transfer period because 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.380
 signings the market today is already 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.810
 closed then I prefer that this 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.520
 2013-2014 season so career no 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.439
 get signings because they are done 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.450
 I want everything to be in the chelsea already 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.280
 Ozil in anxiety but do not get 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.470
 more chips than that part so I leave it 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.830
 activated tutorial of the global network of 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.310
 transfers 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.290
 well let's go off 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.560
 more to the tutorial this jump by the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.560
 eggs 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.910
 the 100 has been sold to its star one 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.750
 film new star the goalkeeper of this 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.490
 alternate 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.869
 well here is the main menu 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.869
 we're going to have in the office 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.460
 national cup I introduce myself 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.640
 This is what the scouts are worth 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.340
 mariah what moves 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.090
 they are coaches for objective handovers 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.950
 in league 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.950
 we hope it improves 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.180
 come on that mostly you ask me rather 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.670
 what is the cup talks with 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.060
 players eyes can now that the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.060
 players 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.360
 for the staff I think this is good 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.560
 alignment with william on the right 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.710
 let's try and see how 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.400
 you have the training numbers and other 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.400
 central 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.930
 norm that we have in the office 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.700
 conversations with players or howard to 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.270
 see what coach tells me he was 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.500
 thinking I like more and wanting to 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.060
 make all the sacrifices I have 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.350
 what to do to play this level so 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 I'm using retire at some point 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.060
 of this season 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.730
 I eat well 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.010
 objective of cop of the champions wait 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.459
 win or win the champions wait 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.459
 well 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.360
 ask a lot 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.360
 I want to play a first game 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.120
 play friendly match 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.120
 against I do not know what are these 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.480
 against evian thonon this team 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.700
 it exists good so let's put the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.710
 first preseason match 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.480
 friendly match 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.040
 against a team that is that I do not know I do not know 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.640
 I do not know who they are and where they are from 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.640
 let 's wait 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.470
 Let's go there 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.930
 I see much more calm and much more 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.280
 concentrated in the party of the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.789
 everything is there is less bad 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.789
 goodness 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.950
 until the second part of what has been achieved 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.540
 everything comes 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.880
 there is ramirez is as always 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.880
 arriving this guy 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.860
 to 10 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.470
 I have an eye there is Samuel 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.949
 and every eye bounced and the goal of 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.949
 samuel eto'o 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.000
 there is the goal of samuel eto'o with a 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.000
 little bit of luck there 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.160
 we reached 0 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.550
 the party that is costing more than 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.550
 expected 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.120
 it's over good has cost but good 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.130
 we are in preseason has cost the 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.430
 true the first match but good 2 a 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.430
 0 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.150
 and nothing because that has been all for now 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.790
 if you liked the haixun like if 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.050
 you want more video of these comments and 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.160
 well, that's the way race to 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.080
 lack of seeing a little how are the 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.300
 transfers and some things called that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.650
 on the menu the truth that seems to be 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.140
 very complete we are going to have a career 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.850
 keep looking at him and nothing else kids 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.850
 we see in the next video until another
