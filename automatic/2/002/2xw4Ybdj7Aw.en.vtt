00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.940
 that was not the word it seems to me that the 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.709
 actor is that it is a trade but yes I 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.059
 it seems to be a trade that people 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.309
 have to cultivate more and have to 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.650
 study more and have to 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.360
 tools to do it better 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 and I think he said he's talking to 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.500
 the oscar is saying that daniel 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.240
 day-lewis is a fool because I think that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.460
 the fool is he 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.490
 total the senator I think a person 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.100
 that is in favor of governing us and of 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.890
 directing a town can not qualify 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.500
 so absolutely nothing can not treat 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.780
 from stupid fools to no guild me 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.739
 I believe and some person that is what to me 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 I think it's wrong 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.590
 Well, I think there's no need to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.269
 be aggressive as he is doing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.400
 Arming benedetti with the theme of 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.380
 actors I am an actress and obviously 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.990
 jump before this comment 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.350
 not only are we fools we are people 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.030
 that we work very hard and well 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 maybe he does not know the actors work 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.020
 wonderful as meryl streep or they are 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600
 I highly recommend that you see your 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.790
 films 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.880
 and then tell me if really the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.530
 actors we are fools 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.390
 I would only say to Mr. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.939
 senator is that the only way to be 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.070
 matched is doing us our 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 I work fine but you gentlemen 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.020
 politicians much more 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.580
 to all the trills I put I put them to 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.580
 the time of transmission then always 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.460
 I referred to the oscar awards the one that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.040
 it annoyed everyone or the actors 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.039
 of my country is when I say thread and 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.009
 I also wrote it wrong that what 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.860
 Oscars the actors seemed a lot 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.950
 of silly semicolons for those who do not 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.350
 you know that semicolon and the boars 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.810
 will be the producers and owners of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 study that never went out in the oscars 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.509
 then there's that it was clear that I'm 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 referring only to the element of the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.259
 prizes os
