fine you know back in the day it was all

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
fine you know back in the day it was all
good<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:29.369> gonna<00:00:29.490> push<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> thing

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
good but we're gonna push this thing

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
good but we're gonna push this thing
we're<00:00:30.510> gonna<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.779> left<00:00:31.019> hard<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.470> gonna<00:00:31.560> go

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we're gonna go left hard we're gonna go

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
we're gonna go left hard we're gonna go
right<00:00:31.949> hard<00:00:32.219> we're<00:00:32.399> gonna<00:00:32.460> go<00:00:32.669> forward<00:00:32.969> hard

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
right hard we're gonna go forward hard

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.990 
right hard we're gonna go forward hard
and<00:00:33.750> gonna<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.920> dangerous<00:00:35.309> situations

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and gonna get some dangerous situations

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.560 
and gonna get some dangerous situations
yes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
yes

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.530 
yes
racing<00:00:37.050> yes<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
racing yes so what we want to do is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
racing yes so what we want to do is
switch<00:00:39.750> over<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> fuel<00:00:40.559> cell<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.489> big

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
switch over to a fuel cell and the big

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
switch over to a fuel cell and the big
difference<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> fuel<00:00:42.360> cells<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
difference with the fuel cells it has a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.740 
difference with the fuel cells it has a
bladder<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:45.570> impact

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
bladder and so if you get a side impact

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
bladder and so if you get a side impact
or<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.350> County<00:00:46.649> impact<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> old<00:00:47.789> days<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
or any County impact in the old days it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000 
or any County impact in the old days it
would<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.480> shear<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> metal<00:00:49.230> pour<00:00:49.739> gas

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
would just shear the metal pour gas

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
would just shear the metal pour gas
everywhere<00:00:50.520> catch<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.090> fire<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.079> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
everywhere catch on fire and I don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
everywhere catch on fire and I don't
have<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> fun<00:00:52.980> situation<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.670> about

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
have not a fun situation think about

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160 
have not a fun situation think about
where<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.059> tank<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
where that tank is it's right on the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.569 
where that tank is it's right on the
back<00:00:55.379> where<00:00:55.649> you're<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.800> either<00:00:55.949> spin<00:00:56.370> out

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
back where you're gonna either spin out

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
back where you're gonna either spin out
and<00:00:56.610> crash<00:00:56.760> into<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> wall<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.750> hit<00:00:57.930> from

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and crash into a wall get hit from

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
and crash into a wall get hit from
behind<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> safest<00:00:59.670> place<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
behind not the safest place to put a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
behind not the safest place to put a
fuel<00:01:00.570> tank<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.399> way<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
fuel tank so a really good way to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
fuel tank so a really good way to
upgrade<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.149> safety<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> we're<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
upgrade your safety and we're going to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
upgrade your safety and we're going to
talk<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> performance<00:01:05.700> great

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
talk about some of the performance great

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
talk about some of the performance great
for<00:01:06.360> packaging<00:01:06.869> those<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> look

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
for packaging those so if you look

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
for packaging those so if you look
inside<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.240> cell<00:01:09.659> foam<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
inside there's this cell foam and this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
inside there's this cell foam and this
is<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> basically<00:01:11.130> baffle<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> gas

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
is going to basically baffle the gas

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.660 
is going to basically baffle the gas
keep<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.170> back<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> forth<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
keep it from going back and forth it's a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
keep it from going back and forth it's a
nice<00:01:14.850> easy<00:01:15.150> light<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
nice easy light way to do it and it's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
nice easy light way to do it and it's
stuffed<00:01:17.310> completely<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.509> it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
stuffed completely in there so it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
stuffed completely in there so it's
slowing<00:01:18.930> down<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.200> slosh<00:01:19.740> there's<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
slowing down that slosh there's also a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
slowing down that slosh there's also a
lot<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> ways<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> baffling<00:01:22.080> within

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lot of ways you can do baffling within

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.649 
lot of ways you can do baffling within
tanks<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.159> well<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> look

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
tanks like this as well now if you look

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
tanks like this as well now if you look
at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> cab<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.380> got<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> cool<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:25.950> splash

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
at the cab it's got a cool little splash

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
at the cab it's got a cool little splash

resides here check out this little box
here's<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> pump<00:01:44.729> goes<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:45.899> inside<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
here's the pump goes down inside and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.800 
here's the pump goes down inside and
this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.159> keep<00:01:47.340> fuel<00:01:47.790> inside<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this is gonna keep fuel inside and I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
this is gonna keep fuel inside and I
have<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.200> cool<00:01:49.560> feature<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.369> if

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have a really cool feature on this if

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
have a really cool feature on this if
you<00:01:51.390> flip<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.840> lift<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you flip it lift you see this little

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.010 
you flip it lift you see this little
check<00:01:53.490> ball<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.750> nine

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
check ball in there it's a little nine

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
check ball in there it's a little nine
little<00:01:55.290> ball<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> turn<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> left<00:01:56.610> it's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
little ball so you turn it left it's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
little ball so you turn it left it's
letting<00:01:57.270> gas<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> box<00:01:58.170> where<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> pump

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
letting gas into the box where the pump

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310 
letting gas into the box where the pump
is<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.399> turn<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> right<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> locks<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> off<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is you turn it right it locks it off and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
is you turn it right it locks it off and
keeps<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> fuel<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.000> ya<00:02:03.450> know

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
keeps the fuel from going out ya know

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
going to have a pickup tune you're going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
going to have a pickup tune you're going
to<00:02:25.650> feed<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.220> some<00:02:26.400> pump<00:02:26.730> whether<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to feed to some pump whether it's a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
mechanical way on the other end or maybe

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.580 
mechanical way on the other end or maybe
an<00:02:29.819> electric<00:02:30.120> pump<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> rail<00:02:30.840> getting<00:02:31.500> it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
an electric pump on the rail getting it

in<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.950> fuel<00:02:32.220> cell<00:02:32.519> is<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.420> really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
in the fuel cell is really really

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.940 
in the fuel cell is really really
important<00:02:34.080> especially<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.620> you're<00:02:34.739> drawing

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
important especially as you're drawing

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.199 
important especially as you're drawing
that<00:02:35.160> much<00:02:35.400> fuel<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.849> as<00:02:36.000> all

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that much fuel you know as all

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.900 
that much fuel you know as all

everybody<00:02:39.480> has<00:02:39.630> gone<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.410> tank<00:02:40.739> poem

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
everybody has gone to the in tank poem

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490 
everybody has gone to the in tank poem
yeah<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> reasons<00:02:42.150> are<00:02:42.450> you're<00:02:43.050> pulling

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
yeah and the reasons are you're pulling

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.890 
yeah and the reasons are you're pulling
a<00:02:43.680> vacuum<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.239> fuel<00:02:45.510> out<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
a vacuum to get that fuel out of the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840 
a vacuum to get that fuel out of the
tank<00:02:46.200> out<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> pickup<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.610> pump

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
tank out of the pickup and to the pump

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.670 
tank out of the pickup and to the pump
from<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.080> problem<00:02:49.380> you're

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
from there it's not a problem you're

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.050 
from there it's not a problem you're
pushing<00:02:50.100> you're<00:02:50.489> building<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> lot<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
pushing you're building a lot of

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
pushing you're building a lot of
pressure<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.630> forward<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.410> part's<00:02:52.799> okay

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
pressure to go forward that part's okay

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.309 
pressure to go forward that part's okay
it's<00:02:53.670> pulling<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.209> vacuum<00:02:54.720> well<00:02:55.200> you're

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it's pulling that vacuum well you're

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.960 
it's pulling that vacuum well you're
lowering<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.010> pressure<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.610> lowing

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
lowering the pressure you're lowing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.640 
lowering the pressure you're lowing
you<00:02:57.239> know<00:02:57.330> atmosphere<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.110> whatever<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
you know atmosphere or whatever and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.320 
you know atmosphere or whatever and
you're<00:02:59.069> lowering<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.549> boiling<00:02:59.940> point<00:03:00.150> so

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
you're lowering the boiling point so

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.520 
you're lowering the boiling point so
you're<00:03:00.480> going<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.630> cavitate<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.440> you're

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you're going to cavitate and you're

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.530 
you're going to cavitate and you're
going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.680> vaporize<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.549> whole<00:03:02.730> lot<00:03:02.880> sooner<00:03:03.090> not

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
going to vaporize a whole lot sooner not

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.720 
going to vaporize a whole lot sooner not
good<00:03:03.810> yeah<00:03:04.200> also<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.650> return<00:03:05.040> style<00:03:05.580> fuel

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
good yeah also on return style fuel

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.820 
good yeah also on return style fuel
systems<00:03:06.360> you're<00:03:06.750> sending<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.170> lot<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.500> fuel<00:03:07.709> to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
systems you're sending a lot of fuel to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
systems you're sending a lot of fuel to
the<00:03:07.920> front<00:03:08.220> ready<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> wide-open<00:03:09.420> throttle

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the front ready for a wide-open throttle

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.570 
the front ready for a wide-open throttle
well<00:03:10.290> when<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:10.590> not<00:03:10.769> you're<00:03:11.130> sending<00:03:11.519> a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
well when you're not you're sending a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860 
well when you're not you're sending a
lot<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.180> well<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.630> getting

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
lot of that back well it's getting

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.289 
lot of that back well it's getting
warmed<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.190> fuel<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.640> building<00:03:15.060> heat

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
warmed up so your fuel is building heat

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.059 
warmed up so your fuel is building heat
over<00:03:15.450> time<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.410> getting<00:03:16.680> heat<00:03:16.860> off<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
over time it's getting heat off the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.920 
over time it's getting heat off the
pavement<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.150> you're<00:03:18.299> getting<00:03:18.480> closer<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
pavement so you're getting closer that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.360 
pavement so you're getting closer that
boiling<00:03:19.320> point<00:03:19.620> from<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.859> other<00:03:19.980> direction

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
boiling point from the other direction

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.180 
boiling point from the other direction
so<00:03:21.049> cavitation<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> real<00:03:22.440> easy<00:03:22.470> thing<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.920> do

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so cavitation is a real easy thing to do

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979 
so cavitation is a real easy thing to do
you<00:03:23.700> hear<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> lot<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.060> guys<00:03:24.239> complaining<00:03:24.870> like

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
you hear a lot of guys complaining like

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.620 
you hear a lot of guys complaining like
oh<00:03:25.200> my<00:03:25.560> pump<00:03:25.799> overheated<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.579> stopped<00:03:26.850> but

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
oh my pump overheated and it stopped but

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.690 
oh my pump overheated and it stopped but
after<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> while<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.230> cooled<00:03:28.470> down<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.920> kept

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
after a while it cooled down and kept

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.789 
after a while it cooled down and kept
pumping<00:03:30.090> well<00:03:30.600> you're<00:03:30.810> probably<00:03:30.959> cavitating

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
pumping well you're probably cavitating

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.800 
pumping well you're probably cavitating
you're<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.430> cooling<00:03:32.700> your<00:03:32.970> pump<00:03:33.209> you're

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you're not cooling your pump you're

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.949 
you're not cooling your pump you're
seizing<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.410> up<00:03:34.590> bad<00:03:35.220> deal<00:03:35.519> sure<00:03:35.910> not<00:03:36.299> good<00:03:36.510> or

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
seizing it up bad deal sure not good or

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.330 
seizing it up bad deal sure not good or
your<00:03:37.109> filters<00:03:37.470> clogged<00:03:37.709> not<00:03:37.980> good<00:03:38.190> either

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
your filters clogged not good either

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.640 
your filters clogged not good either
what<00:03:38.760> else<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.060> nice<00:03:39.269> all<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:40.260> buzzing<00:03:40.470> noise

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
what else is nice all that buzzing noise

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.830 
what else is nice all that buzzing noise
it's<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.640> game<00:03:41.850> yeah<00:03:42.299> remember<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.720> old

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
it's in the game yeah remember the old

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.309 
it's in the game yeah remember the old
days

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.350 

yeah<00:03:47.319> not<00:03:47.830> good<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.520> also<00:03:48.670> keeps<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.180> nice<00:03:49.300> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
yeah not good it also keeps it nice and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.390 
yeah not good it also keeps it nice and
cool<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.019> it's<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.260> best<00:03:50.500> place<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.860> put<00:03:51.220> your

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
cool so it's the best place to put your

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.200 
cool so it's the best place to put your
palm<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:52.060> gonna<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.330> great<00:03:52.540> setup<00:03:52.840> so
