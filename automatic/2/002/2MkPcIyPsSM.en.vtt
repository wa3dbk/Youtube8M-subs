00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 hi all volumetric sloppy braids in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 this season they are more relevant than ever 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.759
 can be seen in fashion magazines on 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.860
 pop stars and movies and of course on 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.750
 all the most popular beauty bloggers 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.720
 if you like this style 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.520
 i have good news for you 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 to braid a braid itself can 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.640
 quick and easy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 and this hairstyle can be married with 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 other types of weaving such as 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.660
 oblique spikelet from one of my 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 previous video link this video 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.829
 is in the description and on the screen 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 my own hair unfortunately 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 not long and thick for such 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.499
 goats so i start with the fact that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.249
 fasten my overhead strands on 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.620
 hairpins 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.839
 I do not use the dress on in a blonde 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
 brands by customers and to create effect 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.320
 Miller 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.330
 in fact, after that one could simply 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.330
 move hair to one side and 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.970
 start weaving but since my 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.460
 the hair is very smooth 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.190
 no volume I quickly them on a bunch 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 on the broad curling to give them such 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.229
 fashionable bohemian texture other curls 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 we need nothing I just want to get 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.080
 soft waves so hold the strand on 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.550
 top three some 5 10 seconds and here I have 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 there is one secret too 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.770
 if I don't have time to wind everything up 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 hair I usually wear them only with 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.570
 on one side, as if taking all my hair 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.600
 on one side and then wind it up 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 only the top strands are the topmost strands 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.619
 I wind those from the roots 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 are directly below them i 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.930
 I wind from the middle to the lowest I 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.149
 I donâ€™t cheat at all but there are few in it 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.850
 I guess because they are so light 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 waves on the upper layers of the hair create 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.530
 natural curling effect on the whole 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.110
 the procedure takes me about 10 minutes 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.300
 instead of the usual 40 50 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.580
 so here's a secret like me already 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.490
 said for the hair itself can not 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.770
 cheat but the technique itself is suitable for 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 any hair texture smooth in for 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
 wavy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.740
 for curly results every time will be 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.709
 look slightly different but always 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.130
 stylish and fashionable so don't be afraid 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.290
 experiment 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570
 I prick my top strands like this 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.790
 just to show you what 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.800
 This hairstyle is also possible 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.880
 if you for example have no bangs 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.100
 or 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.660
 some shorter strands of hair you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.960
 you can just fasten your hair 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.360
 first in valve nku back today 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.440
 I decided to collect my hair in the tail but 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.540
 it's just to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.150
 to diversify my usual braids 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800
 usually i just start weaving and in this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 case you could do exactly that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.540
 today I divide my host by 3 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 equal parts and begin to braid 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.900
 ordinary braid of 3 strands 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.569
 that is, transferring the extreme strands to 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.810
 central after the right strand 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.150
 lays down on the central I connect the left 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.969
 and the central strand and as a result 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.700
 I get 2 strands and thicker 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.799
 on the left and more subtle on the right and here from them 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.459
 I'm starting to braid an ordinary braid 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.040
 spikelet 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.409
 that is, I separate the thin strand by 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.290
 edge of the left strand and carry it to 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.329
 right side then i separate the thin 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.209
 strand on the edge of the right strand and 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.359
 I transfer it to the left side then 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.459
 repeat the steps again pick up thin 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.519
 a lock on the left and adding it to the right 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.519
 strands 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.739
 I pick up the fine strand on the right and 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.739
 adding it to the left strand 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.280
 pick up and move to the other side 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.069
 grabs and carry on the other side 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.930
 I repeat these steps about ten times 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.120
 so that our spit spike begin 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.830
 to be seen 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.890
 then i take my thicker left 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.260
 strand and divide into 2 equal parts in 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.180
 As a result, I have three strands of 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.459
 which i can braid ordinary 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.950
 pigtail so i bear the left strand 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.769
 on the center right strand on 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.890
 center left strand and again 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.840
 I transfer to the central and then connect 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.180
 right and center strands into one 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.840
 after that and again about the stove my braid 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.519
 spikelet starting on the right 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.180
 that is, I grab a thin strand 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.160
 on the right and carry it to the left then I 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.970
 I pick up the fine strand on the left and 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.100
 I transfer it to the right and then 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.620
 curses 10 12 such steps and again 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 I will divide my right side into two parts and 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.350
 start weave ordinary braid of 3 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.060
 strands 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.280
 it remains only to secure the ends 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.889
 small rubber band and fold our 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.110
 pigtail this is of course completely on your 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.270
 discretion want you to stretch a pigtail 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.479
 maybe not but for me it is 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.750
 always the most favorite moment and neat 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.280
 pull strands of links into my pigtails 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.500
 moving up from the bottom several times 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.720
 the pigtail from this will become softer 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.550
 bulk and air 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.070
 it's up to you how much you want her 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.170
 stretch the most fashionable braids in this 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.200
 Season this those which maximum 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.990
 stretched basically a pigtail on this 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.780
 stage ready but now i will dissolve mine 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.110
 upper strands of hair and using the most 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.580
 long strands to close my gum 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.220
 if you do not have such strands and you too 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.590
 would like to close your rise 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.240
 there is the best thing to do before 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.970
 how do you braid your pigtail 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.430
 just using a lock of your tail 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.740
 I'm just wrapping a band around 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.700
 my top layers balance and fix 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.700
 its end is not visible 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.820
