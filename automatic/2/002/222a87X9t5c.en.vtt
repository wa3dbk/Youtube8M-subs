decide to wall off his front door so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
decide to wall off his front door so
we'll<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.370> about<00:02:11.430> because

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we'll see what that's all about because

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.720 
we'll see what that's all about because
you<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.300> can

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
you know you can

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.470 
you know you can
run<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.150> Eleanor<00:02:13.540> stalker<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.080> here<00:02:14.349> but

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
run as Eleanor stalker in here but

typically speaking Protoss players don't
go<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.519> early<00:02:18.700> aggression<00:02:19.000> against<00:02:19.390> terran

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
go for early aggression against terran

go for early aggression against terran
to<00:02:19.900> gate<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.319> typically<00:02:21.099> frowned<00:02:21.370> around<00:02:22.180> upon

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
to gate is typically frowned around upon

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.899 
to gate is typically frowned around upon
against<00:02:22.959> terran<00:02:23.230> because<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.549> hard<00:02:24.849> to

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
against terran because it's so hard to

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.210 
against terran because it's so hard to
bust<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.420> front<00:02:25.720> door<00:02:26.019> even<00:02:26.769> if<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
bust up that front door even if this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.470 
bust up that front door even if this
barracks<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.760> place<00:02:27.970> they're<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:28.420> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
barracks is in place they're just a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.210 
barracks is in place they're just a
bunch<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.720> Marines<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.319> hold<00:02:29.560> off<00:02:29.709> quite<00:02:30.190> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
bunch of Marines can hold off quite a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.309 
bunch of Marines can hold off quite a
bit<00:02:30.370> along<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.299> high<00:02:31.569> ground<00:02:31.930> site

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
bit along with that high ground site

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.460 
bit along with that high ground site
advantage<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:34.720> here<00:02:34.840> tester<00:02:35.290> is

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
advantage so we can see here tester is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.740 
advantage so we can see here tester is
getting<00:02:35.830> whoa<00:02:36.069> double<00:02:36.730> gas<00:02:36.940> before<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
getting whoa double gas before the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.449 
getting whoa double gas before the
cybernetics<00:02:38.319> core<00:02:38.500> warps<00:02:38.769> in<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.190> he<00:02:39.340> is

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
cybernetics core warps in so he is

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.850 
cybernetics core warps in so he is
getting<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.879> very<00:02:40.510> gas<00:02:40.870> intensive<00:02:41.379> build<00:02:41.590> could

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
getting a very gas intensive build could

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.940 
getting a very gas intensive build could
it<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> Stargate<00:02:42.790> coming<00:02:43.180> down<00:02:43.950> actually

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
it be a Stargate coming down actually

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.710 
it be a Stargate coming down actually
think<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.190> void<00:02:45.489> ray<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.970> these<00:02:46.480> positions

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
think a void ray in these positions

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.289 
think a void ray in these positions
would<00:02:47.200> be<00:02:47.349> extremely<00:02:47.950> powerful<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.670> STC<00:02:49.000> here

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
would be extremely powerful and STC here

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.699 
would be extremely powerful and STC here
is<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.569> for<00:02:49.810> what<00:02:49.930> seems<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.349> be<00:02:50.379> some<00:02:50.620> kind

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
is going for what seems to be some kind

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.099 
is going for what seems to be some kind
of<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.920> one<00:02:51.160> racks<00:02:51.400> fe<00:02:52.269> build<00:02:52.510> he<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.840> throwing

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
of a one racks fe build he is throwing

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.809 
of a one racks fe build he is throwing
down<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.440> command<00:02:53.739> center<00:02:53.980> has<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.489> walled

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
down that command center has not walled

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.119 
down that command center has not walled
off<00:02:54.970> we<00:02:55.480> got<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.750> rely<00:02:55.959> on<00:02:55.989> his<00:02:56.290> marines<00:02:56.739> to

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
off we got to rely on his marines to

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.190 
off we got to rely on his marines to
deal<00:02:57.760> with<00:02:58.060> any<00:02:58.239> scouting<00:02:58.599> workers<00:02:59.019> that

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.339 
might try to come in we do have the SUV

corner so this is really trying to hide
the<00:03:20.440> void<00:03:20.590> rays<00:03:20.799> for<00:03:21.010> as<00:03:21.099> long<00:03:21.400> as<00:03:21.459> possible

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
the void rays for as long as possible

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.970 
the void rays for as long as possible
and<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.810> gotta<00:03:23.019> assume<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.799> void

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
and I gotta assume it's going to be void

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.229 
and I gotta assume it's going to be void
rays<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.609> think<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.209> a

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
rays I don't think it's going to be a

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.150 
rays I don't think it's going to be a
Phoenix<00:03:25.720> when<00:03:26.349> you've<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.769> these<00:03:26.950> closed

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
Phoenix when you've got these closed

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.759 
Phoenix when you've got these closed
positions<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.790> here<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.150> go<00:03:28.470> STC<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.680> be

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
positions and here we go STC going to be

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.409 
positions and here we go STC going to be
throwing<00:03:29.980> down<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> couple<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.849> barracks<00:03:31.239> so

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
throwing down a couple more barracks so

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.180 
throwing down a couple more barracks so
very<00:03:31.750> similar<00:03:32.109> to<00:03:32.169> that<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:32.620> reacts<00:03:32.859> if<00:03:33.040> you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
very similar to that one reacts if you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.559 
very similar to that one reacts if you
build<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.910> was<00:03:34.090> talking<00:03:34.359> about<00:03:34.419> earlier

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
build that I was talking about earlier

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.479 
build that I was talking about earlier
he<00:03:35.079> actually<00:03:35.200> has<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> tech<00:03:35.889> lab<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.130> little<00:03:36.400> bit

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
he actually has a tech lab a little bit

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.050 
he actually has a tech lab a little bit
earlier<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.730> stimpaks<00:03:39.730> coming

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
earlier and so we have stimpaks coming

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.339 
earlier and so we have stimpaks coming
out<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.419> that<00:03:40.510> tech<00:03:40.750> lab<00:03:40.930> looks<00:03:41.109> like<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
out from that tech lab looks like the

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.780 
out from that tech lab looks like the
bunker<00:03:41.680> they're<00:03:41.859> getting<00:03:42.310> destroyed

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
bunker they're getting destroyed

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.240 
bunker they're getting destroyed
salvaged<00:03:43.389> at<00:03:43.569> least<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.019> there<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.799> void

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
salvaged at least and there is a void

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.370 
salvaged at least and there is a void
ray<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.880> stalker<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.720> way<00:03:46.840> Marauders

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
ray and a stalker on the way Marauders

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.500 
ray and a stalker on the way Marauders
and<00:03:47.560> stim<00:03:48.370> pack<00:03:48.400> being<00:03:48.790> researched<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.359> now

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and stim pack being researched right now

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.750 
and stim pack being researched right now
but<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> SEC<00:03:50.260> still<00:03:50.530> does<00:03:50.739> not<00:03:50.769> know<00:03:51.069> oh<00:03:51.549> there

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
but the SEC still does not know oh there

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220 
but the SEC still does not know oh there
we<00:03:51.910> go<00:03:51.940> he<00:03:52.209> looks<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.599> he<00:03:52.720> did<00:03:52.840> get<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:52.989> scan

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
we go he looks like he did get a scan

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.250 
we go he looks like he did get a scan
down<00:03:53.440> so<00:03:53.950> he<00:03:54.099> does<00:03:54.400> see<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.790> Stargate<00:03:55.569> or<00:03:55.780> at

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
down so he does see the Stargate or at

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.110 
down so he does see the Stargate or at
least<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.530> got<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.889> saw<00:03:57.099> that<00:03:57.250> with<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> SUV

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
least you got you saw that with the SUV

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.789 
least you got you saw that with the SUV
and<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.329> looks<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:58.660> tester<00:03:59.200> they're<00:03:59.379> shown<00:03:59.769> a

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
and it looks like tester they're shown a

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.530 
and it looks like tester they're shown a
little<00:04:00.129> bit<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.700> don't<00:04:01.150> know<00:04:01.299> what<00:04:01.480> that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
little bit of a I don't know what that

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.080 
little bit of a I don't know what that
means<00:04:01.870> i'm<00:04:01.989> gonna<00:04:02.139> say<00:04:02.290> pi<00:04:02.500> sine<00:04:02.739> pi<00:04:03.040> sine<00:04:03.310> but

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
means i'm gonna say pi sine pi sine but

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.119 
means i'm gonna say pi sine pi sine but
in<00:04:04.299> korean<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.840> could<00:04:05.049> be<00:04:05.169> darn<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.739> saw

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
in korean that could be darn it you saw

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.119 
in korean that could be darn it you saw
my<00:04:06.340> stargate<00:04:06.879> so<00:04:07.450> i<00:04:07.480> think<00:04:07.989> right<00:04:08.319> now<00:04:08.470> as<00:04:08.919> a

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
my stargate so i think right now as a

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.379 
my stargate so i think right now as a
tester<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.549> going<00:04:09.669> to<00:04:09.730> move<00:04:09.910> out<00:04:10.060> with<00:04:10.269> this

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
tester is going to move out with this

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.550 
tester is going to move out with this
force<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.720> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> try<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.109> apply<00:04:11.349> some

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
force is going to try to apply some

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.930 
force is going to try to apply some
early<00:04:11.739> pressure<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.250> at<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.669> same<00:04:12.879> time

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
early pressure and at the same time

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.000 
early pressure and at the same time
could<00:04:13.510> try<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.230> some<00:04:14.440> damage<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:14.799> the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
could try to do some damage with the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.439 
could try to do some damage with the
void<00:04:15.190> ray<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.549> air<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.000> looks<00:04:16.239> like<00:04:16.299> he

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
void ray in the air so it looks like he

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.449 
void ray in the air so it looks like he
might<00:04:16.570> try<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> divert<00:04:17.769> some<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.190> marines

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
might try to divert some of the marines

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.120 
might try to divert some of the marines
away<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.389> front<00:04:19.630> door<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:21.010> right

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
away to that front door and really right

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.760 
away to that front door and really right
now<00:04:21.159> STC<00:04:21.760> doesn't<00:04:22.180> have

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
now STC doesn't have

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.320 
now STC doesn't have
and<00:04:22.830> many<00:04:23.039> Marines<00:04:23.430> he<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.819> trying<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.150> pump

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
and many Marines he is trying to pump

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.420 
and many Marines he is trying to pump
them<00:04:24.479> out<00:04:24.629> right<00:04:24.780> now<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.340> interesting<00:04:26.340> to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
them out right now and interesting to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.610 
them out right now and interesting to
note<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:26.669> he<00:04:27.240> got<00:04:27.870> kind<00:04:28.169> of<00:04:28.229> going<00:04:28.410> for<00:04:28.560> this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
note that he got kind of going for this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.100 
note that he got kind of going for this

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
his command center however and it looks

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.790 
his command center however and it looks
like<00:05:00.030> oh<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.479> barracks<00:05:00.900> could<00:05:01.110> go<00:05:01.319> down<00:05:01.530> and

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
like oh the barracks could go down and

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.980 
like oh the barracks could go down and
notice<00:05:02.280> this<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.550> very<00:05:02.940> costly<00:05:03.449> investment

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
notice this is a very costly investment

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.140 
notice this is a very costly investment
for<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.440> STC<00:05:04.860> he's<00:05:05.220> not<00:05:05.490> mining<00:05:05.880> with<00:05:06.000> these

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
for the STC he's not mining with these

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.570 
for the STC he's not mining with these
five<00:05:06.419> workers<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.020> he's<00:05:07.319> wasting<00:05:08.190> minerals

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
five workers and he's wasting minerals

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.339 
five workers and he's wasting minerals
to<00:05:08.729> repair<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.599> barracks<00:05:09.990> as<00:05:10.139> well

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
to repair the but the barracks as well

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.890 
to repair the but the barracks as well
so<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:10.949> is<00:05:11.069> a<00:05:11.130> very<00:05:11.580> very<00:05:11.970> bad<00:05:12.270> position<00:05:12.479> for

deciding<00:06:16.740> to<00:06:16.980> switch<00:06:17.190> it<00:06:17.310> up<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.580> get<00:06:17.700> a<00:06:17.730> fast

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
deciding to switch it up and get a fast

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.630 
deciding to switch it up and get a fast
Stargate<00:06:18.450> instead<00:06:19.110> starport<00:06:19.710> excuse<00:06:20.040> me<00:06:20.190> not

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
Stargate instead starport excuse me not

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.130 
Stargate instead starport excuse me not
really<00:06:20.850> fast<00:06:21.060> actually<00:06:21.450> just<00:06:21.660> getting<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.900> star

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
really fast actually just getting a star

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.810 
really fast actually just getting a star
port<00:06:22.350> and<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.890> suppose<00:06:23.310> he's<00:06:23.460> going<00:06:23.610> to<00:06:23.670> get

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
port and I suppose he's going to get

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.880 
port and I suppose he's going to get
that<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.150> deal<00:06:24.390> with<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.870> what<00:06:25.200> the<00:06:25.320> void<00:06:25.620> rays

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
that to deal with the what the void rays

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.320 
that to deal with the what the void rays
would<00:06:26.100> get<00:06:26.280> out<00:06:26.400> some<00:06:26.550> Vikings<00:06:26.940> always<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.150> good

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
would get out some Vikings always a good

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.660 
would get out some Vikings always a good
idea<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.960> so<00:06:28.800> that's<00:06:28.980> going<00:06:29.160> to<00:06:29.220> be<00:06:29.310> a<00:06:29.370> good

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
idea and so that's going to be a good

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.490 
idea and so that's going to be a good
transition<00:06:30.420> a<00:06:30.630> good<00:06:30.780> idea<00:06:30.990> for<00:06:31.140> him<00:06:31.260> but<00:06:31.380> it

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
transition a good idea for him but it

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.140 
transition a good idea for him but it
looks<00:06:31.650> like<00:06:31.710> tester<00:06:32.220> here<00:06:32.400> they<00:06:32.730> starting<00:06:33.090> to

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
looks like tester here they starting to

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.120 
looks like tester here they starting to

start researching that blink and Colonel

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.510 
start researching that blink and Colonel
boosting<00:06:43.440> that<00:06:43.560> blink<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.010> you<00:06:44.100> can<00:06:44.220> get<00:06:44.310> it<00:06:44.430> as

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
boosting that blink so you can get it as

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.240 
boosting that blink so you can get it as
quickly<00:06:44.910> as<00:06:45.120> you<00:06:45.240> possibly<00:06:45.270> can<00:06:45.900> and<00:06:46.250> once

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
quickly as you possibly can and once

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.100 
quickly as you possibly can and once
tester<00:06:47.910> gets<00:06:48.180> that<00:06:48.330> blink<00:06:48.630> he'll<00:06:48.810> be<00:06:48.930> able<00:06:49.020> to

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
tester gets that blink he'll be able to

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.290 
tester gets that blink he'll be able to
abuse<00:06:49.560> this<00:06:49.860> position<00:06:50.370> right<00:06:50.490> here<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:50.910> this

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
abuse this position right here and this

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.570 
abuse this position right here and this
is<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:51.480> very<00:06:51.870> deadly<00:06:52.260> position<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:52.920> blink<00:06:53.220> into

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
is a very deadly position to blink into

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.850 
is a very deadly position to blink into
because<00:06:53.910> really<00:06:54.480> as<00:06:55.050> a<00:06:55.140> Terran<00:06:55.500> player<00:06:55.620> you've

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
because really as a Terran player you've

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.860 
because really as a Terran player you've
gotta<00:06:56.130> put<00:06:56.730> your<00:06:56.760> Marines<00:06:57.120> here<00:06:57.420> your<00:06:57.600> Marines

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
gotta put your Marines here your Marines

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.120 
gotta put your Marines here your Marines
and<00:06:57.990> your<00:06:58.110> forces<00:06:58.470> here<00:06:58.650> at<00:06:58.740> the<00:06:58.800> front<00:06:58.950> door

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
and your forces here at the front door

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.460 
and your forces here at the front door
to<00:06:59.370> deal<00:06:59.880> with<00:07:00.060> her<00:07:00.150> ass<00:07:00.330> and<00:07:00.600> it's<00:07:01.020> tough<00:07:01.290> to

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
to deal with her ass and it's tough to

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.320 
to deal with her ass and it's tough to
run<00:07:01.650> all<00:07:01.950> the<00:07:02.250> way<00:07:02.280> back<00:07:02.460> up<00:07:02.670> here<00:07:02.700> to<00:07:02.910> deal

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
run all the way back up here to deal

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.660 
run all the way back up here to deal
with<00:07:03.570> the<00:07:03.720> blinking<00:07:04.200> stalkers<00:07:04.650> so<00:07:04.920> it's<00:07:05.190> going

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
with the blinking stalkers so it's going

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.460 
with the blinking stalkers so it's going
to<00:07:05.730> be<00:07:05.820> tough<00:07:06.060> for<00:07:06.600> the<00:07:06.720> STC<00:07:07.020> I'm<00:07:07.230> not<00:07:07.350> sure

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
to be tough for the STC I'm not sure

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.270 
to be tough for the STC I'm not sure
what<00:07:07.590> you<00:07:07.620> seem<00:07:07.770> able<00:07:07.860> to<00:07:07.980> do<00:07:08.070> about<00:07:08.220> that

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
what you seem able to do about that

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.100 
what you seem able to do about that
looks<00:07:08.580> like<00:07:08.670> we<00:07:08.790> have<00:07:08.940> a<00:07:09.210> phoenix<00:07:09.660> coming<00:07:09.990> in

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
looks like we have a phoenix coming in

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.530 
looks like we have a phoenix coming in
here<00:07:10.290> now<00:07:10.500> primarily<00:07:11.400> for<00:07:11.850> scouting<00:07:12.090> purposes

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
here now primarily for scouting purposes

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.480 
here now primarily for scouting purposes
I'm<00:07:12.660> got<00:07:13.080> to<00:07:13.170> assume<00:07:13.440> and<00:07:13.680> it<00:07:14.040> is<00:07:14.190> doing<00:07:14.430> a

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
I'm got to assume and it is doing a

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.890 
I'm got to assume and it is doing a
little<00:07:14.700> bit<00:07:14.850> of<00:07:14.880> her<00:07:15.000> ass<00:07:15.180> gonna<00:07:15.480> pull<00:07:15.780> the

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
little bit of her ass gonna pull the

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.900 
little bit of her ass gonna pull the
Marines<00:07:16.140> back<00:07:16.440> these<00:07:16.740> stalkers<00:07:17.100> almost<00:07:17.670> have

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
Marines back these stalkers almost have

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.360 
Marines back these stalkers almost have
blink<00:07:18.330> right<00:07:18.570> now<00:07:18.720> blink<00:07:19.020> is<00:07:19.200> nearly<00:07:19.620> complete

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
blink right now blink is nearly complete

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.370 
blink right now blink is nearly complete
and<00:07:20.640> as<00:07:21.150> well<00:07:21.390> as<00:07:21.480> the<00:07:21.660> tests<00:07:21.870> are<00:07:21.960> getting<00:07:22.230> his

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 
and as well as the tests are getting his

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.840 
and as well as the tests are getting his
second<00:07:22.680> expansion<00:07:22.890> up<00:07:23.130> so<00:07:23.310> he's<00:07:23.490> not<00:07:23.700> falling

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
second expansion up so he's not falling

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.210 
second expansion up so he's not falling
behind<00:07:24.060> in<00:07:24.300> the<00:07:24.450> economy<00:07:24.930> at<00:07:25.080> all<00:07:25.350> blink<00:07:26.010> is

now fully fully researched and he can

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.680 
now fully fully researched and he can
blink<00:07:29.100> in<00:07:29.190> here<00:07:29.430> and<00:07:29.580> start<00:07:30.060> to<00:07:30.150> do<00:07:30.240> some<00:07:30.270> very

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.690 
blink in here and start to do some very

blink in here and start to do some very
