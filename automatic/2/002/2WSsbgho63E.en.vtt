 days and nothing I will give you ten books and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 you have to guess them just by touch 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 or by touch by smell too 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 It's worth and ten of those ten books are me 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 I hope you do not do my books 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.450
 difficult but in the end it was changed 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.780
 that he takes from the book while I 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 I put here the thing and such to not see it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030
 Well, if the plane is changed, what 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460
 I feel 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.700
 I do not understand there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.130

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.220
 by charles benoit 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 second 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.360
 it's a saga 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.360
 the beasts 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.049

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.330
 and I will say wake up explanation 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.520
 apply then main bases and other 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.310
 it appears very small of third fuck 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.880
 book 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 Oh 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.930
 it had to be hard 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.930
 is that I look like this pocket 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.850
 is that they seem super small to me 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.250

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.990
 to the 6 best pleasant experiences 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.740
 it's the price 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.740
 priceless 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.680
 this pocket 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.220
 how strong 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.040
 I'm going to say it's another clinic for 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 america not 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 which is strong is the fifth 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.739
 know what these 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.739
 in the dome 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.590
 and I can only say that I put it because 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.940
 thank you very much for part of my sixth 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.940
 father is shown to us 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.600
 is a company that leads 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.600
 it's safer 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.170
 in the tact of those of English 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.980
 this expression is 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.840
 and that is free to do what happens 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.310
 that my fucking camera is tolerating everything 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.459
 the day and it turns off and on when 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.290
 it comes out of there then it's good 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.510
 count as a bit so you can 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.510
 make this book the seventh 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:20.079
 but you can not be super nice if you do not 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.079
 is 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.510
 I think 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.510
 It can be the ashes of angels 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.370
 the passenger 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.880
 and above, I feel like it's worth it, thanks 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.479
