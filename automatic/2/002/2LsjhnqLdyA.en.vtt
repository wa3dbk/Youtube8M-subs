00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 it's hard for the team to play because 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.420
 that the bottom one was just confused even 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.570
 at first it was not clear that they did not know 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 what to do 2-7 can be made her 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 wants it so much leadership 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 Well done and then as if by 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.029
 well you made such a big three 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.000
 years you countries melted a little 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.699
 believed that the game was already done there 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.220
 but when such a big jerk is normal 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.960
 then there is a slight decline in order 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 quarters there to get them to capture 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 but did what was required of us and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 Look good 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.090
 last last months is very tough 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.989
 we train the focus on 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 to the defense and whoever is interested can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.039
 rewrite for training what's there 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.840
 it is going on these then we play tough and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.219
 today we managed to start the game 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 transfer it to the game that is this 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.160
 stiffness due to which destroyed in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.379
 completely their attacks 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:04.500

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.869
 I have a lot of questions to ours 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.659

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.550
