wet and you know just hammer it on the
second<00:01:35.770> when<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:35.920> back<00:01:36.070> your<00:01:36.220> gun<00:01:36.340> up<00:01:36.490> to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
second when you back your gun up to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.310 
second when you back your gun up to
about<00:01:36.700> 18<00:01:37.060> inches<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.540> really<00:01:37.870> just<00:01:38.020> kind<00:01:38.230> of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
about 18 inches and really just kind of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.460 
about 18 inches and really just kind of
dust<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.860> on<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.750> know<00:01:40.870> that's<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.290> you're

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
dust it on and you know that's it you're

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.470 
dust it on and you know that's it you're
done<00:01:41.620> for<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.920> most<00:01:42.070> part<00:01:42.370> I<00:01:42.490> think<00:01:42.550> 85%<00:01:43.420> of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
done for the most part I think 85% of

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.450 
done for the most part I think 85% of
the<00:01:43.540> colors<00:01:43.780> we'll<00:01:43.960> cover<00:01:44.230> in<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.190> coat

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the colors we'll cover in this to coat

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.950 
the colors we'll cover in this to coat
application<00:01:45.670> which<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.510> nice<00:01:46.630> but<00:01:46.780> what<00:01:46.900> I'm

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
application which is nice but what I'm

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.630 
application which is nice but what I'm
not<00:01:47.080> doing<00:01:47.230> here<00:01:47.440> is<00:01:47.860> blending<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
not doing here is blending so the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.000 
not doing here is blending so the
application<00:01:49.120> is<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.300> little<00:01:49.600> bit<00:01:49.690> different<00:01:50.010> so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
application is a little bit different so

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.530 
application is a little bit different so
the<00:01:51.220> first<00:01:51.400> thing<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.700> have<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.909> do<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.330> apply

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
the first thing I have to do is apply

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.000 
the first thing I have to do is apply
what<00:01:52.780> they<00:01:52.930> call<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> wet<00:01:53.500> bed<00:01:53.740> which

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
what they call the wet bed which

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.440 
what they call the wet bed which
hopefully<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.460> guys<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.760> marketing<00:01:55.150> change

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
hopefully the guys in marketing change

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.390 
hopefully the guys in marketing change
that<00:01:55.659> name<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.979> know<00:01:57.100> it's<00:01:57.190> kind<00:01:57.340> of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
that name it's a you know it's kind of

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.719 
that name it's a you know it's kind of
gross<00:01:57.610> but<00:01:57.640> anyway<00:01:58.300> what<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.110> does<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.800> gives

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
gross but anyway what that does is gives

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.330 
gross but anyway what that does is gives
your<00:02:00.970> entire<00:02:01.300> surface<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:02.080> wet<00:02:02.530> area<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:03.070> blend

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
your entire surface a wet area to blend

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.250 
your entire surface a wet area to blend
your<00:02:03.700> color<00:02:04.030> into<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.690> you're<00:02:04.900> not<00:02:05.020> going<00:02:05.200> to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
your color into so you're not going to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.899 
your color into so you're not going to
have<00:02:05.380> any<00:02:05.560> dry<00:02:05.890> spray<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.460> apply<00:02:06.850> this

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
have any dry spray so you apply this

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.509 
have any dry spray so you apply this
over<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.659> entire<00:02:07.690> panel<00:02:08.649> except<00:02:09.129> for<00:02:09.369> your

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
over the entire panel except for your

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.300 
over the entire panel except for your
repair<00:02:09.909> area<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.080> repair<00:02:11.409> area<00:02:11.830> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
repair area and in the repair area you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490 
repair area and in the repair area you
will<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.580> take<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:13.180> usually<00:02:14.019> use<00:02:14.110> two<00:02:14.290> guns

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
will then take I usually use two guns

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.780 
will then take I usually use two guns
for<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.830> you'll<00:02:14.980> take<00:02:15.190> your<00:02:15.340> base<00:02:15.490> coat

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
for this you'll take your base coat

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.420 
for this you'll take your base coat
hammer<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> first<00:02:16.959> coat<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.530> then<00:02:18.160> pull

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
hammer on the first coat and then pull

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.730 
hammer on the first coat and then pull
it<00:02:18.550> back<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.060> dust<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.319> second

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
it back and dust out the second

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.900 
it back and dust out the second
and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.950> kind<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.310> blend<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and then you kind of to blend it as you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.330 
and then you kind of to blend it as you
go<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:23.170> blending<00:02:23.530> technique<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.130> pretty

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
go so the blending technique is pretty

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:36.520 
go so the blending technique is pretty
well<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.730> same

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.500 

so<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.310> kick<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> blower's<00:02:38.210> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
so then I just kick on the blower's and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
so then I just kick on the blower's and
as<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.870> see<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.170> little<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.350> more

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
as you can see it's a little bit more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.050 
as you can see it's a little bit more
productive<00:02:39.710> than<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> BSF<00:02:40.580> line<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.880> course

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
productive than the BSF line of course

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.060 
productive than the BSF line of course
when<00:02:41.330> everything<00:02:41.690> goes<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.410> plan<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.950> it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
when everything goes to plan so it's

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.140 
when everything goes to plan so it's
going<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.220> free<00:02:43.340> up<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.460> little<00:02:43.610> time<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:44.120> a
