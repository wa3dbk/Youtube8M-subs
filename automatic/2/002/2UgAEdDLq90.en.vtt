Team Deathmatch and I had a bit of

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.789 
Team Deathmatch and I had a bit of
trouble<00:03:35.750> not<00:03:36.750> maneuvering<00:03:37.260> around<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.650> map

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
trouble not maneuvering around the map

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.589 
trouble not maneuvering around the map
but<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.190> finding<00:03:38.519> people<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.209> wanted<00:03:39.540> to

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
but just finding people but I wanted to

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.500 
but just finding people but I wanted to
fuck<00:03:39.930> around<00:03:40.049> with<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.409> setups<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.859> little<00:03:41.099> bit

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
fuck around with the setups a little bit

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.020 
fuck around with the setups a little bit
so<00:03:42.510> i<00:03:42.569> use<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.930> i<00:03:43.229> think<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.040> m416<00:03:44.699> with<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
so i use the i think the m416 with the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.229 
so i use the i think the m416 with the
ACOG<00:03:45.389> scope<00:03:45.419> i<00:03:45.930> believe<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.849> was<00:03:47.970> still<00:03:48.209> i

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
ACOG scope i believe but it was still i

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.089 
ACOG scope i believe but it was still i
think<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.810> was<00:03:48.870> pretty<00:03:49.079> pretty<00:03:49.590> decent

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
think it was pretty pretty decent

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.059 
think it was pretty pretty decent
gameplay<00:03:50.430> i<00:03:50.459> would<00:03:50.669> say<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.949> guys
