00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
which is a flap now we have a full point

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.439 
which is a flap now we have a full point
of<00:00:27.570> paint<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.970> we<00:00:29.970> want<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> avoid

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
of paint there and we want to avoid

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
trips as much as possible so i recommend

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
trips as much as possible so i recommend
emptying<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.340> fair<00:00:35.340> amount<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
emptying out the fair amount of the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.990 
emptying out the fair amount of the
paint<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> third<00:00:38.430> left<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

the<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.320> set<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.559> aside

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the can and you can just set that aside

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
one on so like the walls if you don't

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.510 
one on so like the walls if you don't
get<00:03:10.230> everything<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.860> first<00:03:11.100> time<00:03:11.370> around

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.590 

it<00:03:40.080> trims<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.770> different<00:03:41.160> because<00:03:41.600> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it trims a little different because you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.370 
it trims a little different because you
know<00:03:42.690> you're<00:03:42.870> working<00:03:43.230> very<00:03:43.410> precisely<00:03:43.980> and
