00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.719
 for football, for example, quite a bit 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.870

 garmin hoebee ended up doing that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 actually through my my management 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.659

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.040
 ensured that I ended up there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.159
 because of course they did 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.659

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.450
 so train around 20 to 25 hours a week 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.129

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.000
 yeah actually pretty good it's a whole 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 nice experience it started less 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 with the falls in the team time trial 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.750
 but I think I can be satisfied 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.709
 looking back I'm not not up to it 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.470
 must go and yes decide on time 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.380
 that I would step down and it is good 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.819
 gave birth and it was even more recent 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.400
 you also have a dutch championship 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.510
 well scored say how do you look 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 back to that 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.190
 yes the time trial was as good as 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.099
 natural individual part 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.760
 keep the maximum out and that was one 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.150
 fifth place and yes last Sunday how 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.209
 it nk and can i have my share for that 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.769
 the team can do and yes my 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.090
 team mate you were able to finish it nicely 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.120
 to make 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.030
 and yes very happy with it 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.769
 that is not your specialty mine 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.650
 specialty is more 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.410
 Limburg hills and the classics 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.630
 such as accidents and price how away and then 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.000
 just a little bit the time then 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.389
 also on training and of which 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.450
 victory you dream of the round of 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.450
 Flanders 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.290
 and now the tour is coming, he who follows 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.730
 and who will win 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.950
 yes i am actually all month of july 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.269
 at home so I go my can him completely 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.810
 to follow 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.010
 I think yes that all comes through though 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.230
 is going to win 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.400
 the evoque proved that he was that froome 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.709
 can beat and don't think about it 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.230
 well that will be the very nice fight 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.940
 shit the netherlands success in it i think 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.769
 normally goes very close 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.870
 is going to end but I don't know if that 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.900
 the tour came in and came stage 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.609
 yeah when i got quite a few men 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.430
 who can win and in tour stage 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.500
 like tom who had slaughter and and 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.079
 of course mollema itself that good sprint 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.010
 So I think this year it will 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.010
 can be in it
