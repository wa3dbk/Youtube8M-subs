00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.490
 yeah place de gaza xix you finally from 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.070
 back yeah that's been a while 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.020
 but I admit that it's been a while 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.550
 and today I do not hide you so 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.750
 already I speak to you is quickly done 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.609
 gameplay so it's a very good group 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 and I think I do I do 32 or 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
 33 like that but the finals it was 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 before I believe the sniper update 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.870
 at that age at dessert I believe that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 that was before this brief listen 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.600
 today I find you for a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.309
 gameplay for can you explain 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.350
 why I do not know if why I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 more does that why that why so 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 while many do not care 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.739
 the first state as fat the video I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.200
 think you're growing it second and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.340
 that they are crazy brief all that to say 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.260
 that's it 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.980
 can not hide it there in a few 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.930
 days and at 5 gta that happens so that's it 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 will not exist for a very very 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 very much of us I think 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 so I think it's understandable 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 video above 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.260
 especially since after direct there will be it 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.690
 the new game consoles next-gen 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.950
 forgiveness so here on this subject 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.260
 Moreover I will take the xbox we 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.490
 has already spoken on twitter or facebook 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.229
 swan and I speak a little bit quickly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.220
 the shot but I will come back on some 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.630
 little details magri that the gameplay 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.050
 not last very long that I tried 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.560
 to do that very quickly knowing that ghost 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.550
 apparently we have more of a starter 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.619
 I do not want to buy it 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.600
 I read you honestly I rather 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.050
 want to devote myself to bay on gta 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.200
 5 to have fun because it's going to be okay 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.130
 to be the case I think that here I have 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.780
 several bands of friends who have 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.490
 buy it everyone on xbox so I 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.630
 mean I'm going to bet on them I think 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 maybe make small montages 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.440
 stunts stunt all that so I think that 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.869
 the small mounts of land you 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 know with cd file crashes 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.810
 video that makes me happy 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.950
 I do not say that then it did not 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.630
 pleasure to do the same but it's not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420
 there like it's madness you with your 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.500
 mates it's fun fun fun past there 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.539
 has not a single moment where you are rare 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.709
 really what yeah on my and video 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.510
 like that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.480
 call of when it will come back I 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 do not know there are surely and mini ffa 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.030
 who will arrive who announces very heavy 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.190
 because it's almost like ribs 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 fi triplets shot that good 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.790
 stuff many corners that's what me 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.610
 rest because when I saw that which made 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 that at their turn that had on my 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.130
 chain I believe that by the time it is 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.630
 there are still no 200 players 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.520
 it almost makes one next week 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.780
 it does not make you want to leave 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.340
 after I know I have not been acquired that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 give not put two more in velay view 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
 on the garonne because hey there he rattles 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.470
 that's it was seen a lot bump 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.910
 it makes me not want yes although I 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.410
 know that it's still part of my 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 fault it's me who activates not enough 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.160
 right we'll say about a video 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 because I leave a principle I 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.590
 make a video when I want one 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.390
 It is a pleasure 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.320
 here is but today the envi me 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.340
 gives all say a little about what is 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.410
 so that's so soon I think 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.000
 as soon as video gta 5 strongly transposed 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.250
 and after compared to this story of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.350
 kid quick scope thing I do not know 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.140
 maybe I have to convert to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.510
 battlefield 4 I do not know I say that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.500
 but I do not know, I will stay on 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.560
 the game that makes me happy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.730
 waiting for the famous little crowd title 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.070
 handful guys I think you in 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.980
 have heard about 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.110
 this month for those who know me I 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.300
 am very very very very big fan of 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.790
 call of 4 from the beginning and had to 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.500
 replay even more in this moment it's going 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.210
 to hurt I'm just waiting here but 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.590
 listen to this gameplay is over just for 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.020
 tell you a little trick I approach 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.550
 3000 subscribers so thank you very much I 'm going 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.110
 do a small special assembly 3000 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.790
 subscribers with old clips by cons 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 clips that date from the beginning of the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.720
 black of the past that I did a lot 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.680
 of clips since I have never shown 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.580
 that I started doing them so I 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.770
 wanted to show faster by 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.270
 this time there was exile station at the 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.270
 next and I admit
