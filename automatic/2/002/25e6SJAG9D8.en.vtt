a<00:00:27.140> nice<00:00:27.439> clean<00:00:27.980> ring<00:00:28.460> all<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.820> way<00:00:29.150> around

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
a nice clean ring all the way around

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.290 
a nice clean ring all the way around
nice<00:00:29.810> uniform<00:00:30.529> surface<00:00:31.429> and<00:00:31.999> there<00:00:32.119> might<00:00:32.270> be

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
nice uniform surface and there might be

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.780 
nice uniform surface and there might be
some<00:00:32.630> pitting<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:33.770> stuff<00:00:34.070> like<00:00:34.280> that<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.550> have

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
some pitting and stuff like that I have

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.000 
some pitting and stuff like that I have
a<00:00:34.820> little<00:00:35.210> bit<00:00:35.360> of<00:00:35.450> discoloration<00:00:36.010> but

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
a little bit of discoloration but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.590 
a little bit of discoloration but
nothing<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.520> looks<00:00:38.060> like<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:38.390> going<00:00:38.540> to

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
nothing that looks like it's going to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.190 
nothing that looks like it's going to
allow<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:39.140> gases<00:00:39.950> to<00:00:39.980> pass<00:00:40.310> by<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:41.450> spritz<00:00:41.960> not

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
allow the gases to pass by it spritz not

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.320 
allow the gases to pass by it spritz not
perfect<00:00:42.860> on<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:43.250> one<00:00:43.490> the<00:00:43.610> intake<00:00:43.910> valves

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
perfect on this one the intake valves

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.930 
perfect on this one the intake valves
are<00:00:44.450> much<00:00:44.750> better<00:00:45.080> but<00:00:45.410> by<00:00:46.310> all<00:00:46.490> means<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.880> think

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
are much better but by all means I think

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.880 
are much better but by all means I think
this<00:00:47.270> valve<00:00:47.540> is<00:00:47.720> going<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.020> seal<00:00:48.260> just<00:00:48.560> fine

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
this valve is going to seal just fine

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.180 
this valve is going to seal just fine
and<00:00:49.220> again<00:00:50.180> on<00:00:50.540> this<00:00:50.840> on<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:52.220> head<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.980> wipe

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
and again on this on the head you wipe

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.130 
and again on this on the head you wipe
out<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:55.760> stuff<00:00:56.150> here

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
right here and it's got to spring around

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.460 
right here and it's got to spring around

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
the thin end down it's kind of like a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.640 
the thin end down it's kind of like a
wedge<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:42.300> first<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.320> kind<00:03:43.620> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
wedge and the first one you just kind of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.290 
wedge and the first one you just kind of
got<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.980> push<00:03:44.190> down<00:03:44.400> hard<00:03:44.460> it's<00:03:45.000> already

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.970 
got to push down hard it's already
compressed<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.410> mostly<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:46.950> to

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
compressed but you just mostly have to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.720 
compressed but you just mostly have to
move<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:47.760> side<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.360> other<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:50.520> it

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
move it to one side of the other and it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.390 
move it to one side of the other and it
sits<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.590> groove<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.950> neck<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
sits in the groove on the neck of the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.770 
sits in the groove on the neck of the
valve<00:03:53.900> kind<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.960> locks<00:03:55.170> itself<00:03:55.530> into<00:03:55.830> place

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
valve kind of locks itself into place

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.390 
valve kind of locks itself into place
