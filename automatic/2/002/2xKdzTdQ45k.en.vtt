00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
instruction manual and even if you did

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.290 
instruction manual and even if you did
it's<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.410> big<00:00:07.560> pain<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.799> read<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.790> right<00:00:09.090> now<00:00:09.179> I'm

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.160 
them up the power switch is right here
pretty<00:00:25.170> simple<00:00:25.500> you're<00:00:26.160> left<00:00:26.400> mono<00:00:26.670> input

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
pretty simple you're left mono input

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
pretty simple you're left mono input
goes<00:00:28.170> right<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.580> goes<00:00:29.760> into<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.150> amp

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
input and the input right here is just

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.250 
input and the input right here is just
as<00:00:33.989> input<00:00:34.350> goes<00:00:34.710> into<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.040> guitar<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> you

as input goes into your guitar so you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.729 
as input goes into your guitar so you
get<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.530> effects<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.570> right<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> 13

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and 14 is the only ones I use and it go

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.360 
and 14 is the only ones I use and it go
up<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.020> down<00:00:43.079> between<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> number<00:00:43.620> use<00:00:43.770> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
up and down between the number use this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.869 
up and down between the number use this
down<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.710> pretty<00:00:46.710> simple<00:00:47.070> when<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.370> 32

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
down as up pretty simple when it has 32

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.290 
down as up pretty simple when it has 32
I<00:00:48.030> believe<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.690> 32<00:00:49.140> each<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.620> those<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.190> B<00:00:50.850> C

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I believe in 32 each of those has a B C

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
I believe in 32 each of those has a B C
and<00:00:51.539> D<00:00:51.719> settings<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> each<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and D settings and each of these is a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
and D settings and each of these is a
setting<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> bunch<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
setting to so you got a bunch of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
setting to so you got a bunch of
different<00:00:55.050> ones<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.559> okay<00:00:55.949> say<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> crunch

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
different ones like okay say a is crunch

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
different ones like okay say a is crunch

sounds<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:07.760> you<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.180> B

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
sounds like this you get that one B

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.730 
sounds like this you get that one B
which<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:11.000> metal<00:01:12.000> distortion<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.570> me<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
which is a metal distortion for me and a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
which is a metal distortion for me and a
stomp<00:01:14.010> add<00:01:14.250> boost<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.540> solo<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.170> it

stomp add boost so you can solo with it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
stomp add boost so you can solo with it
a<00:01:16.470> delay<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.580> course<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.210> tap<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
a delay of course and you can tap the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
a delay of course and you can tap the
delay<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.080> change<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.409> delay<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
delay you can change your delay and to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
delay you can change your delay and to
edit<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> settings<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.890> pretty

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
edit the settings on here it's pretty

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
edit the settings on here it's pretty
simple<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.610> double<00:01:24.090> click<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
simple you just double click one of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
simple you just double click one of
these<00:01:25.130> whichever<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.189> want<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> add<00:01:26.549> and

these whichever you want to add and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
these whichever you want to add and
basically<00:01:27.540> add<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> distortion

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
basically add is what kind of distortion

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.249 
basically add is what kind of distortion
stomp<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.820> whatever<00:01:30.060> boost<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.869> whatever<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
stomp is whatever boost or whatever you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.260 
stomp is whatever boost or whatever you
like<00:01:31.409> modulation<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> effect<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
like modulation is the effect like this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.740 
like modulation is the effect like this
modulation<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.869> believe<00:01:34.520> yep<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.759> chorus<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
modulation I believe yep it's chorus so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.950 
modulation I believe yep it's chorus so
when<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> turn<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.579> you<00:01:38.579> can<00:01:38.610> hear<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> good

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
when I turn it on you can hear a good

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.200 
when I turn it on you can hear a good
coffee<00:01:40.380> smell

got<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.650> double-click<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
got that one if you double-click it you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
got that one if you double-click it you
can<00:01:51.000> change<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:52.110> called<00:01:52.290> sign<00:01:52.620> course

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
can change it it's called sign course

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.500 
can change it it's called sign course
and<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.670> change<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.270> simply<00:01:54.479> use

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
and to change it you just simply use

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.780 
and to change it you just simply use
this<00:01:54.690> little<00:01:54.840> knob<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.610> add
