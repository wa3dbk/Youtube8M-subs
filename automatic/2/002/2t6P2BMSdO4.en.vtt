00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
hits the locking mechanism that's what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.470 
hits the locking mechanism that's what
you<00:00:59.600> do<00:00:59.750> if<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.110> fender<00:01:00.440> bolts<00:01:00.770> are<00:01:00.920> closer

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
you do if the fender bolts are closer

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.010 
you do if the fender bolts are closer
this<00:01:02.480> will<00:01:02.629> fit<00:01:02.809> most<00:01:03.020> as<00:01:03.350> is<00:01:03.890> as<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.810> but<00:01:05.810> if

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
this will fit most as is as is but if

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.989 
this will fit most as is as is but if
you<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.499> go<00:01:06.619> wider<00:01:06.889> and<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:07.219> run<00:01:07.789> out<00:01:07.969> of

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
you have to go wider and you run out of

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.080 
you have to go wider and you run out of
space<00:01:08.920> that's<00:01:09.920> where<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.280> comes<00:01:10.579> in<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:10.939> is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
space that's where this comes in this is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.459 
space that's where this comes in this is
an<00:01:11.240> extension<00:01:11.689> plate<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:14.139> will<00:01:15.139> allow<00:01:15.409> you
