internationally<00:02:25.810> at<00:02:25.870> least<00:02:26.050> nationally

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
internationally at least nationally

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.050 
internationally at least nationally
known<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.130> think<00:02:27.250> they'll<00:02:27.610> probably<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:28.000> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
known I think they'll probably have a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.910 
known I think they'll probably have a
single<00:02:28.630> that's<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.900> breakout<00:02:29.320> single<00:02:29.740> because

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
single that's a breakout single because

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.680 
single that's a breakout single because
I<00:02:29.980> think<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.190> got<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.340> talent<00:02:30.580> but<00:02:31.420> here's<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I think I got a talent but here's the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.020 
I think I got a talent but here's the
thing<00:02:31.720> though<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.130> they<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.370> run

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
thing though I think that they do run

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.790 
thing though I think that they do run
the<00:02:34.180> same<00:02:34.390> risk<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.840> lot<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.170> people<00:02:35.590> run

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
the same risk that a lot of people run

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.080 
the same risk that a lot of people run
into<00:02:35.950> like<00:02:36.220> I've<00:02:36.430> always<00:02:36.760> said<00:02:36.940> like
