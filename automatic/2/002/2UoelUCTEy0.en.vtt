00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 collective transportation is a theme of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.319
 moment in 2011 we met one of the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 largest buses in the world and runs 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.389
 It's curious and it's huge. 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.539
 takes more than 200 people the 360 ​​engine 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.930
 horses and automatic gearbox and 28 meters 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.930
 of lenght 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.570
 this is the light a bus full of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.830
 space and technology from start to finish 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 of the trip has no collector within the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.520
 glass 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.300
 at the entrance to classical music for 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.300
 receive the passengers 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.710
 the bomb did not calm down inside that peace 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.140
 is also reflected in the tranquility of the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.630
 driver open the doors all thin 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.950
 a button on all to see all 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.980
 Just to close, you can not close. 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.660
 all have to close from a none and it is 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.360
 controlled by the rearview mirror 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.379
 attempting to drive a vehicle 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.830
 gigantic like this 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.390
 Let's admit it is very brave and without 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.360
 the importance of the work of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 albino since we have the authorization not 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.900
 it's hard to try 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.140
 it was already going he's three meters bigger than 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.119
 than normal biomarketing and have a 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.840
 fundamental rule for not leaving the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.640
 rails 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.149
 this bus has been compared to the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.570
 subway he spends three in three minutes 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.610
 many people up to 250 people and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.430
 circulates through an exclusive corridor that is 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 practically a very long straight line 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:45.000
 the driver he almost does not 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 need the straight panel full of buttons 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's very simple to operate 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.180
 in addition to the driver and passengers 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.820
 warn about the stops and collaborate with 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.920

 will get off the bus in the garage of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.300
