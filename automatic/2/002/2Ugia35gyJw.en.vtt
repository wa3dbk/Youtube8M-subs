00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.650
 suppose two different levels 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.920
 electrically charged by contact 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
 and red 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.090
 or the metal that has excess honest people creating these types of the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.119
 salvation 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.199
 when temporary positive ions 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 must extract the former treasurer 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:31.869
 it was the tonic 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 hawks almost 100 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.710
 when the negative ions reach the surface 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 the lost electrons 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.250
 that way the electrolyte tends to get the metals back to a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 electric driving on the internet 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.440
 so again in caracas 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.590
 a new stream of single electrons 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.609
 because of the difference that exist 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.609
 between its special potentials 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 due to the effect 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 the electrons will follow 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.299
 and will be replaced continuously by the chairs of the selection 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.510
 until all the chemical energy of the selection 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 has been consumed 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.470
 but until that happens 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 the battery sheds light on physics and chemistry 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.010
 the chemical reactions on the intellect separation surface 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.060
 liter ig metal supply ekstrand electrons ready to do it 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.379
 at the point where a metal comes in contact with another metal 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.180
 the difference the sun's energy 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.180
 the same thing and inside them puts them in circulation 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.260
 through 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
 of the electrical circuit and back to the solution 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.189
 where they complete the chemical reaction 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.689
 In summary 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.979
 the chemical energy is converted into electrical energy until the 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.619
 chemical elements are consumed and the battery runs out
