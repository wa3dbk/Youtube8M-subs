00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 and now we jump to this one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.819
 decisive scene plays back what 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.170
 Schweinsteiger was in it before 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.330
 at the 0 0 stand 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.519
 and then this duel happened to lego 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.250
 thomas circled at that time very simple 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 ask for action yes or no for me 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.869
 is a clear red card i dont know 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.430
 where the back judge looked 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.019
 Here you can see such a mischief completely 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.359
 clear with both hands I know 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.160
 not where the fourth official of the yes 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 He also has an arbitration function 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.399
 such things must also show if he 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.309
 she sees 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 that's what the center line is for 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.870
 should also watch the game and the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 was felt 15 meters from his 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.420
 position herberg maybe because he 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.309
 somehow with the trainers again 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 but busy for me it is whole 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 clearly a red card and accordingly 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
 bastian has had tremendous luck that he 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.489
 the game then at least 62 so far 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.489
 get a minute 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.629
 what could motivate the difference 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.430
 have only yellow there 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 So I can only explain it to me that way 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.830
 that he did not see exactly that he 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 only we do not see that he stops 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.420
 outside the fight a little 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.409
 Schubser not every shop are in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 Maybe it's easy 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.070
 Underestimates the hardness of this protection 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.670
 and as such has the there, I give red 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 given but that is very very 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 diplomatic design for the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 Referee is a very clear one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.409
 Misjudgment one must thereby the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.939
 Of course , one can take interest in saying 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.650
 there are red but it is also ridiculous 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.729
 People fall to the ground again when 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.840
 This is somewhere on the freiplatz 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840
 would happen 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.250
 we are hopefully one for that 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.659
 win and hopefully about that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.070
 actually that the bump on the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.690
 free space in the normal click not 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.080
 sufficient to get to the floor 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.729
 go 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.190
 Of course he wants the red card 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.520
 like the community in the war year 2 of the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.050
 War of the 2 that's great he is criticism 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 and hey presto since then does not fall too 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:03.670
 and then there is the back a few minutes 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.369
 before that, schweinsteiger was fouled by 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.610
 from lego 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.989
 I just believe and that's easy 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.760
 a frustrated foul 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.400
 the pattern was rather concealed 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.800
 therefore also as thoma says there can 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 you can blush you he already has one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.190
 had little luck then you 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.430
 your opinion the exclusive round in the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 eye 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.459
 some I'm just saying that it is the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 anyway everyone has to think about it 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.760
 the values ​​of fair play must be 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.830
 that you then ground sinks as if you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.540
 just got hit by the bullet like that 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.750
 I have to say understood the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.750
 was 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.090
 so if someone hit or 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.620
 informed informed and then to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.970
 ground falls or if it goes down then 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.470
 That is perfectly legitimate 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.450
 So we should not sacrifice for 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.630
 Doing offenders and then say yes has 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.340
 can indeed fall now especially is yes 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 also an activity that does not even 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.510
 somehow leads to a blow but 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.370
 only the attempt is indeed punishable 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.400
 So for me that's a clear one 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.810
 action and accordingly 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 because the last as so many pizza 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.300
 wisely against himself 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.520
 Of course they have to ask themselves 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.230
 is now bayern makes and remains 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.360
 that was the fourth argument 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.920
 away games four place references there 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.270
 they have become thoughtful and if 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.400
 The home team is also an actor 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.540
 if nothing happens then nothing happens 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.040
 was I believe, I believe behind 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 reason for the protest of the wolfsburger
