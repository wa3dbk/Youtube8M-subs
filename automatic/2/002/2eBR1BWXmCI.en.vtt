that<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.880> feel<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.150> it's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that kind of thing and I feel like it's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
that kind of thing and I feel like it's
a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.510> ridiculous<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
a little ridiculous that they take that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.760 
a little ridiculous that they take that
away

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.130 

let's<00:01:13.340> go<00:01:13.460> back<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.790> what<00:01:14.420> would<00:01:14.600> fit<00:01:14.810> kind<00:01:15.020> of

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
let's go back so what would fit kind of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.719 
let's go back so what would fit kind of
certainly<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.710> say<00:01:15.890> there's<00:01:16.280> no<00:01:16.460> hazing

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
certainly can you say there's no hazing

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.520 
certainly can you say there's no hazing
or<00:01:17.090> at<00:01:17.180> least<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.420> hazing<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.110> dr.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
or at least the hazing that the dr.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.260

I<00:01:20.540> guess<00:01:21.290> there's<00:01:22.040> no<00:01:22.220> hazing<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.670> mean<00:01:22.820> there

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
I guess there's no hazing I mean there

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.969
