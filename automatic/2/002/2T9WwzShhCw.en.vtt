I'm going to walk over here and the
borders<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> megacity<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.320> from

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
borders of megacity are going to be from

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.320 
borders of megacity are going to be from
probably<00:01:17.659> right<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.070> kind<00:01:20.189> of

probably to the edge of this area so I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
probably to the edge of this area so I
can<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.970> speed<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:28.110> kind

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
can just go and speed this up this kind

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
can just go and speed this up this kind
of<00:01:28.439> show<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> be

of show you what you're going to be

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.920 
of show you what you're going to be
doing<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.329> probably<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> walk

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
doing you probably have to walk

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.039 
doing you probably have to walk
nevertheless<00:01:32.060> there<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.570> that'll<00:01:33.960> be

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
nevertheless there we go so that'll be

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
nevertheless there we go so that'll be
the<00:01:34.229> region<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.680> select<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.790> area

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the region will select so all this area

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
the region will select so all this area
inside<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.930> encompassed<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
inside will be encompassed think of it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
inside will be encompassed think of it
as<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> square<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.240> anything<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.840> point

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
as a square so anything from that point

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
as a square so anything from that point
to<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> point<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.979> everything<00:01:41.490> around<00:01:41.970> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to that point and everything around it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
to that point and everything around it
in<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> square<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.670> protected

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in that square is going to be protected

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
in that square is going to be protected
under<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.090> kingdom<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> kingdoms<00:01:46.470> do

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
under your kingdom and kingdoms do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
under your kingdom and kingdoms do
expand<00:01:47.009> vertically<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.820> they'll<00:01:48.180> go<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
expand vertically so they'll go all the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
expand vertically so they'll go all the
way<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.310> don't

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
way down and all the way up so you don't

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
way down and all the way up so you don't
have<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> worry<00:01:50.759> about<00:01:50.880> making<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> certain

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
have to worry about making it a certain

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.830 
have to worry about making it a certain
height<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.210> after<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.630> complete

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
height and after you have that complete

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.679

ill-used<00:01:55.649> /<00:01:55.829> KD<00:01:56.159> complete<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.060> says<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.450> here

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
ill-used / KD complete it says up here

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
ill-used / KD complete it says up here
now<00:01:58.170> you'll<00:01:58.350> notice<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.159> sidebar<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.820> does

with the amount of qubits or currency

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749 
with the amount of qubits or currency
you<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.509> currently<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> cost<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> kind

you have currently the cost of the kind

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.390 
you have currently the cost of the kind
kingdom<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> cost<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.440> added<00:02:11.250> on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
kingdom and again the cost is added on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.830 
kingdom and again the cost is added on
to<00:02:11.760> seven<00:02:12.120> seventy<00:02:13.050> five<00:02:13.110> thousand

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
to seven seventy five thousand

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.180 
to seven seventy five thousand
it's<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.110> start<00:02:14.290> off<00:02:14.379> with<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.920> since<00:02:15.099> we

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's to start off with but since we

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's to start off with but since we
expand<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.640> relatively<00:02:16.090> large<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.050> to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
expand it relatively large we have to

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.900 
expand it relatively large we have to
have<00:02:17.170> an<00:02:17.290> extra<00:02:17.440> twenty<00:02:17.910> twenty-five

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
have an extra twenty twenty-five

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.479 
have an extra twenty twenty-five
thousand<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.450> bit<00:02:19.690> more<00:02:19.870> key<00:02:20.290> bits<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:21.069> fund<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
thousand a bit more key bits to fund the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.699 
thousand a bit more key bits to fund the
cost<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.030> then<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> shows<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> tithe

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
cost and then it shows you the tithe

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.650 
cost and then it shows you the tithe
that's<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.250> size<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.700> blocks<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.540> d

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's the size in blocks that's a to d

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.119 
that's the size in blocks that's a to d
square<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.319> that's<00:02:26.470> from<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.980> there

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
square so that's from there to there

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.690 
square so that's from there to there
every<00:02:27.910> single<00:02:28.750> chunk<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.560> 2d<00:02:29.980> would<00:02:30.519> be

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
every single chunk of 2d would be

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.119 
every single chunk of 2d would be
sixteen<00:02:31.660> thousand<00:02:31.989> bucks<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
sixteen thousand bucks and then the

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.570 
sixteen thousand bucks and then the
weekly<00:02:33.400> tax<00:02:33.670> will<00:02:34.299> be<00:02:34.860> 6445<00:02:35.860> cubits<00:02:36.250> that'll

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
weekly tax will be 6445 cubits that'll

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.820 
weekly tax will be 6445 cubits that'll
be<00:02:36.670> taxed<00:02:37.030> every<00:02:37.330> week<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.349> now<00:02:38.500> we're<00:02:38.709> going

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
be taxed every week so now we're going

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.770 
be taxed every week so now we're going
to<00:02:38.890> complete<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.549> so<00:02:39.760> dos<00:02:39.910> skd<00:02:40.269> complete<00:02:40.660> as

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to complete it so so dos skd complete as

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.110 
to complete it so so dos skd complete as
it<00:02:40.900> says<00:02:41.080> up<00:02:41.349> here<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.799> then<00:02:42.549> there<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:43.000> have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
it says up here and then there we have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.449 
it says up here and then there we have
our<00:02:43.150> created<00:02:43.599> our<00:02:43.750> kingdom<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.920> before<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
our created our kingdom so before you

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.069 
our created our kingdom so before you
can<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.269> started<00:02:46.510> with<00:02:46.630> anything<00:02:46.930> you

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
can really get started with anything you

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.900 
can really get started with anything you
first<00:02:47.349> have<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.560> create<00:02:47.829> your<00:02:47.890> key<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
first have to create your key and the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.000 
first have to create your key and the
key<00:02:48.940> basically<00:02:49.540> functions<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.260> hub<00:02:50.769> of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
key basically functions as the hub of

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.979 
key basically functions as the hub of
your<00:02:51.069> kingdom<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:51.970> i'd<00:02:52.090> recommend<00:02:52.120> probably

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
your kingdom so i'd recommend probably

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.949 
your kingdom so i'd recommend probably
putting<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.410> either<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.860> center<00:02:54.220> or<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.959> or

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
putting it either in the center or on or

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.660 
putting it either in the center or on or
you<00:02:56.620> probably<00:02:56.920> around<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.190> center<00:02:57.489> would<00:02:57.610> be

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you probably around the center would be

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.369 
you probably around the center would be
a<00:02:57.760> great<00:02:58.150> spot<00:02:58.360> for<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:59.049> this<00:02:59.260> is

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
a great spot for it because this is

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.869 
a great spot for it because this is
going<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.739> be<00:02:59.829> whatever<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.549> going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.819> be

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
going to be whatever it is going to be

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.190 
going to be whatever it is going to be
the<00:03:00.970> core<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.629> your<00:03:01.750> keep<00:03:01.959> out<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.170> your

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
the core of your keep out of your

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.559 
the core of your keep out of your
kingdom<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:03.610> you'll<00:03:03.910> use<00:03:04.060> sash<00:03:04.269> katie

looks good this is exactly where you
want<00:03:26.889> it<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.130> then<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.910> all<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.329> do

want it and then you all you have to do

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.759 
want it and then you all you have to do
is<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.780> slash<00:03:29.079> Katie<00:03:29.440> Keep<00:03:30.010> confirm<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.769> you

is to slash Katie Keep confirm and you
can<00:03:32.889> see<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.579> will<00:03:33.730> now<00:03:33.910> begin<00:03:34.150> building<00:03:34.480> your

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
can see it will now begin building your

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.420 
can see it will now begin building your
keep<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.019> places<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.380> little<00:03:35.620> red<00:03:35.769> stone<00:03:35.980> border

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
keep it places a little red stone border

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.009 
keep it places a little red stone border
around<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.060> indicates<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.989> is

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
around it and that indicates that it is

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.990 
around it and that indicates that it is
building<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.220> whenever<00:03:39.400> there's<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.760> redstone

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
building so whenever there's a redstone

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.550 
building so whenever there's a redstone
border<00:03:40.389> around<00:03:40.450> something<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.079> indicates

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
border around something it indicates

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.319 
border around something it indicates
that<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:41.950> working<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.849> is<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> progress

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
that it is working and it is in progress

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.409 
that it is working and it is in progress
so<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.410> can<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.769> we<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.880> building

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
so as you can see we have a building

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.030 
so as you can see we have a building
itself<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.049> can<00:03:47.109> see<00:03:47.319> it<00:03:47.410> starting<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.829> place

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
itself you can see it starting to place

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.819 
itself you can see it starting to place
the<00:03:48.190> initial<00:03:48.519> flooring<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.200> basically

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
the initial flooring this is basically

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.650 
the initial flooring this is basically
just<00:03:50.919> to<00:03:51.130> ensure<00:03:51.250> there's<00:03:51.760> not<00:03:51.910> following<00:03:52.510> few

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
just to ensure there's not following few

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.270 
just to ensure there's not following few
blocks<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.530> will<00:03:53.590> place<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.889> floor<00:03:54.099> and

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
blocks so it will place the floor and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.140 
blocks so it will place the floor and
then<00:03:54.400> we'll<00:03:54.609> start<00:03:54.730> building<00:03:55.090> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
then we'll start building it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.420 
then we'll start building it
automatically<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.620> right<00:03:56.980> now<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:57.310> just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
automatically so right now I'm just

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.640 
automatically so right now I'm just
going<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.819> set<00:03:58.690> my<00:03:58.780> camera<00:03:58.989> right<00:03:59.230> here<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
going to set my camera right here and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.800 
going to set my camera right here and
you<00:03:59.739> can<00:04:00.310> watch<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.790> auto<00:04:01.000> build<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.569> i'll<00:04:01.660> be

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
you can watch it auto build and i'll be

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:52.390 
you can watch it auto build and i'll be
back<00:04:01.959> once<00:04:02.349> it's<00:04:02.500> complete
