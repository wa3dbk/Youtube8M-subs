then shrink wrap and banding to hold

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.370 
then shrink wrap and banding to hold
everything<00:00:56.460> together<00:00:56.809> most<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.170> been

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
everything together most of that's been

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.110 
everything together most of that's been
removed<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.070> you'll<00:00:59.250> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> remove<00:00:59.820> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
removed but you'll need to remove that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
removed but you'll need to remove that
and<00:01:01.160> dispose<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.460> carefully<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and dispose of it carefully and then I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.630 
and dispose of it carefully and then I
remove<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:04.649> lid<00:01:04.829> and<00:01:08.270> inside<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
remove the lid and inside we have a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.069 
remove the lid and inside we have a
sweep<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> bottom<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:15.420> shower<00:01:15.659> screen

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
sweep at the bottom to shower screen

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.160 
sweep at the bottom to shower screen
glass<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.829> sweeps<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.270> wall<00:01:21.630> wall

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
glass and then sweeps for the wall wall

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.129 
glass and then sweeps for the wall wall
sweeps<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.759> should<00:01:23.999> be<00:01:24.119> packaged<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.840> such

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
sweeps and it should be packaged as such

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.139 
sweeps and it should be packaged as such
so<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.579> is<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.729> mount<00:01:26.999> the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
so the first thing is to mount the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.349 
so the first thing is to mount the
hinges<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> glass<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:29.819> name<00:01:29.999> of<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.209> game

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
hinges on the glass the name of the game

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.629 
hinges on the glass the name of the game
is<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.929> do<00:01:31.139> this<00:01:31.319> without<00:01:31.829> moving<00:01:32.279> the<00:01:32.520> glass

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
is to do this without moving the glass

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.090 
is to do this without moving the glass
around<00:01:33.090> too<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.569> to<00:01:33.959> minimize<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> chance

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
around too much to minimize the chance

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.819 
around too much to minimize the chance
of<00:01:35.340> damaging<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.929> what<00:01:37.170> we're<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.649> do

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
of damaging it so what we're going to do

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.459 
of damaging it so what we're going to do
is<00:01:38.069> Mount<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.549> hinges<00:01:39.119> onto<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.929> glass<00:01:40.170> with

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
is Mount the hinges onto the glass with

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.039 
is Mount the hinges onto the glass with
the<00:01:40.499> glass<00:01:40.799> lying<00:01:41.130> flat<00:01:41.729> pretty<00:01:42.539> much<00:01:42.749> in<00:01:42.959> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the glass lying flat pretty much in the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.209 
the glass lying flat pretty much in the
position<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:45.179> hinges<00:01:45.749> themselves

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
position it's in the hinges themselves

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.059 
position it's in the hinges themselves
have<00:01:47.219> a<00:01:47.359> flat<00:01:48.359> side<00:01:48.630> without<00:01:49.109> any<00:01:49.259> screws<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
have a flat side without any screws and

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.569 
have a flat side without any screws and
then<00:01:50.359> slide<00:01:51.359> with<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:51.840> screws<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:53.039> we

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then slide with the two screws so we

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.969 
then slide with the two screws so we
need<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:54.029> have<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.929> glass<00:01:55.139> such<00:01:55.469> that<00:01:55.679> we<00:01:55.799> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
need to have the glass such that we can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.599 
need to have the glass such that we can
make<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> screws<00:01:56.639> like<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.329> hinge<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.169> this

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
make the screws like the hinge like this

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.550 
make the screws like the hinge like this
so<00:01:59.609> what<00:01:59.880> we're<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.749> move<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so what we're going to do is move the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
so what we're going to do is move the
glass<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.399> prop<00:02:02.819> it<00:02:02.969> up<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
glass over a bit prop it up on the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.220 
glass over a bit prop it up on the
styrofoam<00:02:04.249> slide<00:02:05.249> the<00:02:05.459> hinges<00:02:05.819> in

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
styrofoam slide the hinges in

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.490 
styrofoam slide the hinges in
and<00:02:06.320> then<00:02:06.470> screw<00:02:06.860> them<00:02:06.980> into<00:02:07.220> position<00:02:08.500> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
and then screw them into position the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.290 
and then screw them into position the
screws<00:02:10.400> face<00:02:10.880> into<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.450> shower<00:02:11.780> normally<00:02:12.410> so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
screws face into the shower normally so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.450 
screws face into the shower normally so
we<00:02:14.300> need<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.570> make<00:02:14.750> sure<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.380> top<00:02:16.190> side

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
we need to make sure that this top side

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.070 
we need to make sure that this top side
of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.640> glass<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.420> glass<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:18.020> to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
of the glass is the glass it's going to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.990 
of the glass is the glass it's going to
be<00:02:18.170> as<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.740> side<00:02:19.100> that's<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.610> facing

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
be as the side that's going to be facing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
be as the side that's going to be facing
in<00:02:20.300> towards<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.720> shower<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.710> luck<00:02:22.370> would

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
in towards the shower and as luck would

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.420 
in towards the shower and as luck would
have<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.210> for<00:02:23.450> us<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:24.620> might<00:02:24.920> turn<00:02:25.190> out

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
have it it is for us it might turn out

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.190 
have it it is for us it might turn out
that<00:02:25.490> it's<00:02:25.850> not<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.300> which<00:02:26.480> case<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:26.990> to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
that it's not in which case you have to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.340 
that it's not in which case you have to
gently<00:02:28.190> turn<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.460> glass<00:02:28.820> over<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
gently turn the glass over and do it the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.680 
gently turn the glass over and do it the
other<00:02:30.380> way<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.730> nice<00:02:32.000> doing<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.450> lying

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
other way but it nice doing it lying

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.630 
other way but it nice doing it lying
flat<00:02:32.960> yeah<00:02:33.320> you're<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:33.920> moving<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> glass

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
flat yeah you're not moving the glass

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.700 
flat yeah you're not moving the glass
and<00:02:35.270> now<00:02:35.300> we're<00:02:35.690> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.930> prop<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> glass

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
and now we're going to prop the glass

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.460 
and now we're going to prop the glass
onto<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.760> styrofoam<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.870> just

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
onto the styrofoam so I'm going to just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.950 
onto the styrofoam so I'm going to just
get<00:02:39.770> my<00:02:39.920> fingers<00:02:40.310> under<00:02:40.580> here<00:02:40.820> hit<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.750> glass

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
get my fingers under here hit the glass

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:52.320 
get my fingers under here hit the glass
up<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.370> pop<00:02:43.790> big<00:02:44.090> styrofoam<00:02:47.860> oh<00:02:50.800> yeah

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
up and then pop big styrofoam oh yeah

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.060 
up and then pop big styrofoam oh yeah
now<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.390> next<00:02:53.810> thing<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.620> open<00:02:54.980> up

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
now the next thing to do is to open up

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.060 
now the next thing to do is to open up
the<00:02:55.190> glass<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.550> little<00:02:55.700> bit<00:02:56.710> open<00:02:57.710> up<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
the glass a little bit open up the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.680 
the glass a little bit open up the
plastic<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.520> little<00:02:58.580> bit<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.180> remove<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
plastic a little bit so it remove the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.540 
plastic a little bit so it remove the
corner<00:03:00.200> protectors<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:03.010> install<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> hinges

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
corner protectors and install the hinges

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.200 
corner protectors and install the hinges
top<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.290> here<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.770> we<00:03:07.190> take<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.460> allen<00:03:07.970> key

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
top so here we go we take the allen key

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.730 
top so here we go we take the allen key
that's<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.080> fixings<00:03:11.530> remove<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
that's in with the fixings remove the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.020 
that's in with the fixings remove the
screw<00:03:14.800> same<00:03:15.800> with<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> second<00:03:16.430> screw<00:03:16.730> take

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
screw same with the second screw take

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.190 
screw same with the second screw take
care<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.080> not<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.500> scratch<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.980> nose<00:03:19.190> and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
then remove the top plate there are four

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.940 
then remove the top plate there are four
shins

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
shins

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.370 
shins
so<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:29.209> go<00:03:29.570> on<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.410> other<00:03:30.530> side<00:03:31.510> like<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:35.380> to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
so to go on the other side like this to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.729 
so to go on the other side like this to
go<00:03:37.160> on<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.459> top<00:03:37.700> side<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:41.200> then<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.380> screws

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
go on the top side and then the screws

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.310 
go on the top side and then the screws
here<00:03:43.010> back<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:46.390> see<00:03:47.390> here's<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.810> play<00:03:48.050> on<00:03:48.290> the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
here back in see here's the play on the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.310 
here back in see here's the play on the
hinge<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.120> see<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:50.870> I'm<00:03:50.959> going<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.230> move

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
hinge you can see so I'm going to move

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.890 
hinge you can see so I'm going to move
the<00:03:51.500> hinge<00:03:51.709> a<00:03:51.830> bit<00:03:52.010> away<00:03:52.160> from<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.730> glass<00:03:53.000> in

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
the hinge a bit away from the glass in

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.090 
the hinge a bit away from the glass in
the<00:03:54.020> bottom<00:03:54.410> just<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:55.489> touch<00:03:55.760> maybe<00:03:56.800> sixteenth

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.270 

I<00:04:00.360> also<00:04:01.360> try<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.870> make<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.740> back<00:04:02.950> edge<00:04:03.160> of

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
I also try and make the the back edge of

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.240 
I also try and make the the back edge of
the<00:04:03.370> hinge<00:04:03.610> line<00:04:03.940> up<00:04:04.590> fairly<00:04:05.590> closely<00:04:05.860> with

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
the hinge line up fairly closely with

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.640 
the hinge line up fairly closely with
the<00:04:06.340> back<00:04:06.490> edge<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.910> glass<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.510> then<00:04:08.500> I'm

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
the back edge of the glass and then I'm

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.250 
the back edge of the glass and then I'm
going<00:04:08.770> to<00:04:08.830> tighten<00:04:09.070> them<00:04:09.280> up<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.990> we<00:04:11.050> may<00:04:11.230> have

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
going to tighten them up and we may have

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.310 
going to tighten them up and we may have
to<00:04:11.440> come<00:04:11.680> back<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.310> hinge<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.170> adjust<00:04:14.170> it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
to come back to this hinge and adjust it

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:24.620 
to come back to this hinge and adjust it
a<00:04:14.350> little<00:04:14.380> bit<00:04:14.710> that<00:04:15.340> won't<00:04:16.410> see<00:04:17.410> how<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.739> goes

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.630 

it's<00:04:25.630> tightening<00:04:26.110> there<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.000> bolts<00:04:28.300> up<00:04:28.540> a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
it's tightening there and and bolts up a

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
it's tightening there and and bolts up a
little<00:04:30.640> at<00:04:30.820> a<00:04:30.850> time<00:04:34.740> don't<00:04:35.790> overdo<00:04:36.790> it<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.540> at

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
little at a time don't overdo it but at

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.250 
little at a time don't overdo it but at
the<00:04:37.720> same<00:04:37.900> time<00:04:38.190> fairly<00:04:39.190> firm<00:04:39.930> okay<00:04:40.930> that's

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
the same time fairly firm okay that's

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.650 
the same time fairly firm okay that's
the<00:04:41.410> first<00:04:41.440> hinge<00:04:41.950> done<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:43.180> now<00:04:43.510> we'll

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
the first hinge done and now we'll

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.570 
the first hinge done and now we'll
repeat<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> process<00:04:44.350> with<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.890> top<00:04:45.100> there's

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
repeat the process with the top there's

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.290 
repeat the process with the top there's
the<00:04:45.670> second<00:04:46.630> hinge<00:04:47.460> just<00:04:48.460> remove<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.940> Allen

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
the second hinge just remove the Allen

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.880 
the second hinge just remove the Allen
bolts<00:04:50.010> for<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.040> hex<00:04:51.310> bolts<00:04:51.730> oh<00:04:51.940> yeah<00:04:52.890> that's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
bolts for the hex bolts oh yeah that's

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.280 
bolts for the hex bolts oh yeah that's
the<00:04:54.040> two<00:04:54.190> hinges<00:04:54.610> mounting<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.180> next<00:04:55.450> step<00:04:55.660> is

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
the two hinges mounting the next step is

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.830 
the two hinges mounting the next step is
to<00:04:56.560> offer<00:04:57.460> up<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.850> glass<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.390> wall

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
to offer up the glass to the wall

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.520
