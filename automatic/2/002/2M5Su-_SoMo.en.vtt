if I could have dinner with one
historical<00:01:20.640> figure<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> would<00:01:21.390> be

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
historical figure I think it would be

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.219 
historical figure I think it would be
Queen<00:01:22.860> Elizabeth<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> first<00:01:23.430> when<00:01:24.030> she<00:01:24.270> was

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
Queen Elizabeth the first when she was

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
Queen Elizabeth the first when she was
young<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:27.000> ask<00:01:27.150> her<00:01:27.330> something

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
young I think I would ask her something

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.399 
young I think I would ask her something
really<00:01:27.750> inappropriate<00:01:28.220> um

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
really inappropriate um

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.310 
really inappropriate um
if<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.890> could<00:01:32.070> ask<00:01:32.189> Queen<00:01:32.460> Elizabeth<00:01:33.320> something

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
if I could ask Queen Elizabeth something

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.069 
if I could ask Queen Elizabeth something
I<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:35.090> probably<00:01:36.090> ask<00:01:36.540> her<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:36.960> her

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I would probably ask her about her

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.340 
I would probably ask her about her
personal<00:01:38.070> life<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.340> men<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> was

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
personal life with men and if it was

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
dance movie is the turning point the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.559 
dance movie is the turning point the
story<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.709> just<00:02:15.489> amazing<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.060> all<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
story is just amazing and all of the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.710 
story is just amazing and all of the
actors<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:17.489> really<00:02:18.489> amazing<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.090> not<00:02:19.209> chosen

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
actors are really amazing and not chosen

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.229 
actors are really amazing and not chosen
based<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.799> their<00:02:20.920> dance<00:02:21.130> ability

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
based on their dance ability

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.559 
based on their dance ability
I<00:02:22.799> mean<00:02:23.799> it's<00:02:23.950> also<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.640> slapping<00:02:25.360> scene

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
I mean it's also just the slapping scene

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.449 
I mean it's also just the slapping scene
with<00:02:25.780> Anne<00:02:26.019> Bancroft<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.130> Shirley<00:02:27.430> MacLaine

with Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.069 
with Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine
is<00:02:27.880> kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.750> best<00:02:28.900> scene<00:02:29.110> ever

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
is kind of like the best scene ever

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.000 
is kind of like the best scene ever
we're<00:02:32.079> just<00:02:32.290> seeing<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.470> choreographer<00:02:32.920> has
