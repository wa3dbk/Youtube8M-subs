00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.539
 and is a small highlight in the 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.320
 test lab arrived and that 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:13.660
 toshiba satellite p50 t looks like 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.669
 a normal notebook but that 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.500
 special is the display it is one 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:23.109
 ultra hd display with 3 840 x 2160 and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.340
 I'll put this to you shortly before 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.750
 the equipment side have up here 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.509
 definitely ever a blu ray 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.619
 drive even the burner then took her 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:36.850
 twice usb 3 multi-purpose plus power adapter it 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.329
 clear and on the other side 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:45.340
 we have the jack plug for audio again 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:48.070
 usb3 and hdmi output that's notebook 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.010
 relatively compact that was it in the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.340
 height only 28 cm someone a two euro 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.190
 piece as a comparison now comes ours 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 editorial scales for use and you 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 Maul looks at the room 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 Let's see what the notebook is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:19.630
 and it shows us 238 2 4 kilograms 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.770
 that's okay 15 6 inch notebook 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.220
 I have the satellite first of the city 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.610
 brought and it immediately falls on extremely 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.430
 brilliant display with a very fine 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.159
 Resolution if you look at the logs 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.440
 look and the symbols see everything 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.970
 great thanks to windows 8 1 is the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.020
 scaling was also pretty good but 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.220
 has no like little icons as well 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.940
 maybe that was seven 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.030
 would 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:53.030
 the take a dealer's hand in front of him 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.950
 the display reflects stream strong though 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.020
 I have a white background 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.090
 on that's not really know 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.789
 and if I take a closer look in the eye 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 then I see a very clear crystal 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.569
 Effect, it is just relatively coarse grained 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 the signal places the camera not that 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 Of course, this can be due to the touch foil 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.230
 the over here is above the display 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.790
 but that does not look pretty 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.670
 the display still triggers me on high 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.650
 but also offers a touch function 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.590
 I would rather have in tablet or at 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.150
 if you can use the smartphone 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.930
 short of course that is on the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 earth's surface 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.830
 was trained for it 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.610
 as a graphics card comes a 9265 their 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.660
 for use 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 Amd himself describes it as 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.000
 middle class gpu and together with the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.049
 intense 100 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.370
 It should be really good 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.170
 somehow in that now out with 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.200
 benefit and the upper left is reflex 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:06.750
 counter now we go into a game 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.750
 just look at the good piece to be able to 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.120
 in the options 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.200
 we decide 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.200
 full hd 1 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.080
 and if they already hear 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.080
 the notebook becomes noticeably louder 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.599
 Sun is not loading, it is also 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.120
 especially fast because it is not 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.739
 real ssd installed but the turn 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.670
 the hard disk of difference exists 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.920
 but from hard disks and 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.760
 Flash memory is not so 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.760
 fast as a ssd 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.400
 still alive 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.849
 is 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.970
 but that did not last long 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.970
 a hard drive 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:50.270
 dark green and through the reflection 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.270
 does not see me too much 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.139
 the rough direction should be that 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.030
 even the exit and can here 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:06.120
 At the top we can see 8 10 fps 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.279
 network connected so that would have to 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.319
 actually walk and now is not true 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:15.979
 more and now we lower to 12 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.979
 310 ps 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.900
 this is not yet so great can 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:28.250
 we still have the action a bit 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.250
 reducing is a better way 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:46.020
 You can already play with medium before 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:49.369
 just about 40 a thing you have to 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:54.360
 try running with net now 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:56.129
 434 up to 40 fps now I pull that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.089
 power plug off and usually it is 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.009
 so far 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.649
 new deep caps that then stuck 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:09.149
 underneath you can hook up some apps 

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:14.099
 do not lose the radio differently 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:16.949
 only that the display has become thinner 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.770
 but the fbs are also at 20 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.479
 like 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.439
 the equipment features of the state 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.839
 are really good 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.999
 ultra hd fast processor 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.779
 middle class gbu that's all 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.110
 promising 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.419
 the display of course touch function and 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.289
 so on, however, is the display 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.279
 More sparkle than I would say what 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.039
 we have not shown now is the 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.599
 response time is up to 12 music 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.539
 and that is already on the 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:47.909
 desktop stands for that and the mirroring and 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:52.129
 then only 200 candela so 230 can the 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.129
 luminosity that's just too little
