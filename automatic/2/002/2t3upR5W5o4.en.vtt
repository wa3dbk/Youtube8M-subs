to this world now some of you might

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.689 
to this world now some of you might
remember<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.900> long<00:00:16.529> time<00:00:16.770> ago<00:00:17.039> when<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> had

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
remember that a long time ago when I had

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.349 
remember that a long time ago when I had
4000<00:00:18.630> subscribers<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.580> actually<00:00:20.580> posted<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
4000 subscribers I actually posted a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.950 
4000 subscribers I actually posted a
texture<00:00:22.050> pack<00:00:22.310> it<00:00:23.420> wasn't<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.630> texture<00:00:24.930> pack

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
texture pack it wasn't my texture pack

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.380 
texture pack it wasn't my texture pack
but<00:00:25.410> well<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.130> guess<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.760> sort<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> call<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
but well I guess you can sort of call it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.389 
but well I guess you can sort of call it
that<00:00:27.949> but<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.910> modified<00:00:30.599> version<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.399> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that but it's a modified version of the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.540 
that but it's a modified version of the
OCD<00:00:32.730> texture<00:00:33.059> pack<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.920> this<00:00:34.920> video<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> no

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
OCD texture pack and this video is no

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.470 
OCD texture pack and this video is no
different<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.770> I've<00:00:37.920> done<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.309> line<00:00:38.629> is

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
different but I've done this line is

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.560 
different but I've done this line is
edit<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> texture<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> blocks<00:00:44.570> as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
edit the texture to all the blocks as

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.350 
edit the texture to all the blocks as
you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.039> example<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.700> bed<00:00:47.910> has<00:00:48.149> like

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you can see for example the bed has like

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.319 
you can see for example the bed has like
a<00:00:48.390> fabric<00:00:48.690> texture<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> mushrooms

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a fabric texture to it and mushrooms

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.529 
a fabric texture to it and mushrooms
have<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> mushroom<00:00:51.840> texture<00:00:52.879> wood<00:00:53.879> items<00:00:54.329> have

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
have a mushroom texture wood items have

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.750 
have a mushroom texture wood items have
a<00:00:54.570> wood<00:00:55.170> texture<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.430> as

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a wood texture you can see over here as

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
a wood texture you can see over here as
well<00:00:58.670> looks<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.969> nice<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.899> d7a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
well looks really nice as well as d7a

well looks really nice as well as d7a
like<00:01:02.149> inside<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.769> with<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> three<00:01:05.250> instead

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
like inside of it with a three instead

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.530 
like inside of it with a three instead
of<00:01:05.790> three<00:01:06.119> texture<00:01:07.400> dirt<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.850> dirt<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
of three texture dirt look like dirt and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
of three texture dirt look like dirt and
well<00:01:11.570> sound<00:01:12.570> looks<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.990> sand<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.830> yeah<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.580> my

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
well sound looks like sand so yeah in my

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
well sound looks like sand so yeah in my

opinion this looks really good and adds

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.320 
opinion this looks really good and adds
a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> pack<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.009> well<00:01:23.009> especially<00:01:23.970> as

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
a lot to the pack and well especially as

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.469 
a lot to the pack and well especially as
a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.400> you're<00:01:26.400> doing<00:01:26.640> redstone<00:01:27.090> because

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
a lot when you're doing redstone because

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
a lot when you're doing redstone because
well<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> blocks<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.740> looks<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.280> much

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
well the blocks just looks so much

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.749 
well the blocks just looks so much
better<00:01:30.650> now<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.040> might<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
better now some of you might think that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.530 
better now some of you might think that
whoa<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.930> pointless<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.210> Oh

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
whoa this is pointless this is like Oh

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.660 
whoa this is pointless this is like Oh
OCD<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.470> meant<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.280> no<00:01:38.670> grain<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:40.670> yeah

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
OCD was meant to have no grain and yeah

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
OCD was meant to have no grain and yeah
that's<00:01:42.030> true<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.500> OCD<00:01:43.860> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that's true and but this is not OCD this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.179 
that's true and but this is not OCD this
is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> modified<00:01:44.790> version<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.829> still

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is a modified version of it and I still

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.690 
is a modified version of it and I still
think<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> looks<00:01:49.220> exactly<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.430> OCD

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
think that it looks exactly like OCD

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
think that it looks exactly like OCD
from<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> distance<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.470> once<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:52.950> come

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
from a distance but once when they come

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.440 
from a distance but once when they come
close<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.119> personal<00:01:55.100> everything<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.450> looks

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
close and personal everything just looks

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
close and personal everything just looks
so<00:01:57.659> good<00:01:57.930> and<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.020> yeah<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:02.130> more

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so good and and yeah you have one more

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.630 
so good and and yeah you have one more
to<00:02:02.430> look<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.360> close<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
to look at when you're up close then you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.520 
to look at when you're up close then you
did<00:02:05.640> only<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> normal<00:02:07.020> 2d<00:02:09.319> but
