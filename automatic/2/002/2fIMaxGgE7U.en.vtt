00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Lazaro Cardenas airport increases 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 in your passenger movement every time 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 this is due to the growth that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.259
 has the port is pretty good right now 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.080
 already after January 15 is the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.199
 season starts to notice better is 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.050
 always business tourism people 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 of business is the strong then this one already 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.939
 it is normal for us to think that a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.300
 from the second week of the month of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.079
 January let's start to see this influx of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 business character passengers 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.270
 that is the market that we have 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.340
 here and yes it has been notorious for the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.700
 de haro mar flights 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.600
 good affluence or a flight arrived with 45 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.660
 passengers almost 100% capacity 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.820
 then it's good news is 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.770
 something good is going well the biggest 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.449
 part of the passengers are people who 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.390
 comes to perform some kind of business 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.050
 to the region many people come to the port 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.770
 for business almost 98% of the people who 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.050
 they come to arrive by air at 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.500
 puerto de lazaro cÃ¡rdenas are people who 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:20.290
 comes to the business is indirectly or 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:24.460
 however this is the goal of 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.170
 to come to Lazaro Cardenas this 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.670
 we have done well there has been a crime 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.729
 increase in 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.610
 to the number of passengers in the year 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.540
 earlier I can tell you that the year 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.340
 2013 we closed it with an average of 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.860
 1,800 monthly passengers previously 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.189
 in 2012 it was 1500 the 2011 was of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.229
 1400 then if it has come 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.689
 increasing the number of passengers and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.420
 I think it's because of the growth of 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.090
 port is a huge port is a power 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.399
 a port that is giving much much 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.810
 much then is the diffusion that has been 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.880
 carried out by the authorities 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.530
 port is what is motivating 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.330
 that more and more people go to this 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.019
 region I remember a lot that in the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.319
 2011 the people of the port did a lot 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.510
 international promotion people 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.739
 of the port administration was 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.190
 he was going to hong kong to china to japan 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.910
 to South America to Chile 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.830
 to promote conditions or 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.870
 services that we give or that they give in 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.020
 the port and that really has 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.060
 generated that people turn to see 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.300
 Lazaro Cardenas as a port of height 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 with a first port then to 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.850
 Sometimes it is contradictory that what is 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.010
 I have always fought 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.270
 according to the type of airport that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.460
 we have 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.980
 However, there is more news 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.870
 forward I think that very very close is 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 very close to me I think in this week 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.390
 or the next week they specify this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.230
 some jobs that have already announced 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.800
 that are being formalized to come to 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.590
 give a remodeled to the airport for 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.160
 our vision news reported oscar
