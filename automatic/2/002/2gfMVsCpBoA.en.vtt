00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.500
 but a cultural center 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 there is no way 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.460
 the delegate of the approach in EDF launched to pilot blind people 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 agree that the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.669
 the sooner these clubs make 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.519
 two month day was a very active person in 2004 the father him no matter 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.440
 for me I stay at home so I want to do a lot of things I pilot 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.240
 a plane on the other hand around Europe I want to know what I'm doing 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.190
 paragliding today you can always have envy who is pushing back as he 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 can to access this type of activity 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.140
 so we created a famous search engine association that allows 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.839
 to all and we laugh to access those who spoke Arabic what seems a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.359
 little in advance as unachievable so what to do with its activities soon 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.789
 today gold the podium and car driving school of snow on the ground is sign 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.390
 that one does not quote that one has of oneself 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 I think we can continue then carried by a siren 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.909
 club I must find it surprising that the power to create 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.360
 automotive hubs for people who have never seen it's a beautiful 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.440
 incredible experience and then for people like me who lost their sight 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.240
 recently place a little around the sources 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.579
 the new files of the best effect and extraordinary sensations for 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.090
 to be able to drive in the horror 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.450
 always with a little zest of prehension of course alas 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 it's amazing 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 value 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.800
 This is another thing 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.610
 it is a pity that we apply to all 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.450
 Yes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.940
 no thanks 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.970
 this time bigger than ever the opportunity to remember that the brake 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.559
 engine 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:17.079
 durand they preceded 60 the number of its members for 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 to follow so 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 such 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.619
 for the time being 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:30.779
