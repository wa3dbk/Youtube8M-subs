00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
know we had a fair bit of momentum and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
know we had a fair bit of momentum and
there's<00:00:17.070> apparently<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.520> front<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
there's apparently in front of the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.040 
there's apparently in front of the
sticks<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.359> when<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:18.779> killer

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
sticks and when you got killer

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.510 
sticks and when you got killer
sharpshooter<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> years<00:00:20.189> you've<00:00:20.310> got<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
sharpshooter as the years you've got to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.960 
sharpshooter as the years you've got to
take<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> points<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:22.519> don't<00:00:23.519> think<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> game

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
take the points I don't think the game

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.849 
take the points I don't think the game
should<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.300> been<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.510> close<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
should have been as close as it was I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.920 
should have been as close as it was I
think<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> shot<00:00:27.449> ourselves<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
think we kind of shot ourselves in a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.870 
think we kind of shot ourselves in a
foot<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> fair<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> errors<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
foot a fair bit a lot of errors but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.070 
foot a fair bit a lot of errors but
having<00:00:30.359> said<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.599> there's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
having said that there's a lot of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
having said that there's a lot of
character<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.560> his<00:00:31.679> team<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.099> were<00:00:32.219> able<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
character in his team we were able to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that you know it really lifts the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
that you know it really lifts the
spirits<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.780> shows<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> character<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
our team you know I think a lot of areas

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
our team you know I think a lot of areas
come<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> fact<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.770> we

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
come down to the fact that you know we

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.960 
come down to the fact that you know we
haven't<00:01:13.979> had<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> whole<00:01:14.369> lot<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> time<00:01:14.820> together

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
haven't had a whole lot of time together

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
haven't had a whole lot of time together
as<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> team<00:01:15.540> we've<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.049> injuries

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
as a team we've had a lot of injuries

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
as a team we've had a lot of injuries
and<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> quality<00:01:17.280> players<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.790> Glenn

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and to quality players like Glenn

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.740 
and to quality players like Glenn
Stewart<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.909> think<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
Stewart and and I think that so as a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
Stewart and and I think that so as a
