00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.840 
can see tens basically now this is the
professional<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.530> believe<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.610> they're

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
professional I believe but they're

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.880 
professional I believe but they're
pretty<00:02:33.180> cool<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.290> may<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.770> only

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
pretty cool so they may be the only

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.020 
pretty cool so they may be the only
