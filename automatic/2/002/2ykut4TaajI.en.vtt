00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.129
 who said furniture should be 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.959
 wooden for example japanese 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.959
 australian designers now 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.430
 develop cardboard furniture this sofa 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.320
 and tables and chairs 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 today my guest is the rage pen 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.439
 who will teach how to make comfortable furniture 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.310
 from cardboard 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.410
 tara hello say saw with 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.630
 cardboard apple is still miller and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.579
 what are you talking about is furniture from 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 cardboard is very important 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.220
 share one is in my opinion 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.649
 the most ingenious 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.930
 and simple embodiments of the house of ideas and what are we 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.309
 we will make of cardboard to begin with 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 show here such 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 cardboard box given you understand the essence of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 the fact that there are lots of such boxes 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.039
 we did not acquire as a result we get 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 This box I usually here such boxes 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.519
 appear at first it is a pity to throw out a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 then I understand that for no reason 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.079
 useful and throwing away I suggest you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.239
 make cardboard vertical 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.010
 shelf for shoes shelf 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.300
 it's very good I liked it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 because in the hallway always 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.870
 shoes accumulate 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.940
 but there are no convenient shelves 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.890
 from cardboard we will be fragile she 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.290
 fine with correct edges 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 stiffness and withstands weight 100 or more 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 kilograms and again they do not need to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.440
 it was roomy and comfortable and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.420
 certainly economical in this case from 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.420
 cardboard almost free and see 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.990
 we take here such a piece of cardboard 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.700
 total size is 70 by 60 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.740
 we are based on two compositions 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 rectangle more precisely square and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 rectangle 1 size 25 by 25 2 25 by 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.020
 35 here we have side 25 row 25 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 And here is more on 5 centimeters this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 we need for the right 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.560
 technological processes naturally 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.180
 one side is also a 25 cm girl who 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.360
 right and left 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 their size is 20 by 25 cm and we also 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.220
 useful sizes that are now 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.630
 they call relative depending 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.440
 from what you want to get 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.170
 dimensions of the shelf you define the center 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.640
 make a central rectangle and from 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.560
 he already actually dance in different 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.010
 hand evenly this case with us 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.050
 20 cm to the right and left 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.180
 who stayed after we in 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.030
 the center has this rectangle 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.590
 yes, like this, in principle, while you took 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.560
 all clear well let's cut it off now 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.010
 let's go we do the shelf for 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.990
 shoes from a regular carton box taras 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.850
 says it will turn out well 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.710
 mixer and you have the impression that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.540
 pink cardboard furniture for those who already 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.160
 cannot afford anything at all 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.110
 what are his advantages ? 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.270
 environmentally friendly material if we 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.790
 we can do it cheaper why pay 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.800
 more of course and the pros will also be convenient 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.610
 it will be incredibly comfortable and more 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.150
 nice and practical pluses for the box 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.150
 shoes from a cardboard box just weight 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.690
 so make sure to look again 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.270
 a bit and we will cut off the excess it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.430
 it turns out that women are their weak 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.940
 hands too can make this shelf for 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.220
 shoe 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.170
 it is available even for children 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.360
 we got here is such a letter m 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.820
 we get lines that we will 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.260
 use for bending if we talk about 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.090
 this line which we did not discuss yes 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.280
 Here is such a diagonal is 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.300
 located a little further than the middle 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.430
 this one 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.350
 left or right rectangle somewhere 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.010
 here we have a middle ground back down 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.920
 centimeter 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.959
 put a point and from the corner to this point 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.269
 draw a line from one side to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.650
 lines we bend the cardboard in this way 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.420
 once neatly 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.400
 not to damage the cardboard ruler 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.519
 pinch and bottom like a little bit 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.890
 we press as spoke at women will 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.230
 may I ask please a little bit 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.000
 equal really lightweight 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.860
 if he puts the ruler himself once 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.040
 bent elementary to where the actor and 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.250
 a bit harder with diagonal lines 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.440
 too neatly just have one 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.720
 sides use the ruler in 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.430
 making shelves for shoes such words 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.739
 I speak for the first time, in principle, all 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.700
 the design is ready for the final 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.910
 fixations lift this part we raise 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.040
 our tip of the letter t and thanks to those 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.800
 the bend that we made diagonally 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.370
 we kind of wrap them as a basis with 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.500
 either side of it here is the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.380
 such pocket for slippers 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.300
 or all sorts of shoes especially no years 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.700
 and so the design is well kept me 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.200
 I suggest to use the client for 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.630
 this function will suit perfectly any 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.729
 silicate glue glue for cardboard paper 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.800
 can use silicone 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.940
 a red-hot gun that is beautiful 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.220
 it's all glued ready to help me 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.710
 hold not with pleasure with you 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.260
 here we can immediately put a little 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.669
 glue 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.490
 wrap up here so good 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.720
 presses here in this way well, 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.820
 need a little hold 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.830
 so the glue is dry and grabbed yes I think 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.570
 you can count to 10 and it already seems 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.100
 on the shelf in which you can put 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.350
 shoes remember I told you yes 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.880
 vertical plan what happens next u 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.160
 I have a few blanks 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.930
 who are also ready to use now 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.400
 thanks to the fact that we did one of 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.120
 we have a few more rectangles 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.669
 there is a ledge 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.400
 it is attached to it that's the same 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.260
 the detail comes out like this 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.180
 sections can be any number in one 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.880
 sections we can make holes to hammer 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.490
 an elementary wall of carnations and all this 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.100
 fasten I propose to look at more 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.800
 one sample is already decorating the hay 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.510
 see the same cardboard all the same 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.050
 only on top we can paint it 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.669
 glue 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.490
 or oracal you can use this 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.590
 the twine left to add to it all 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.900
 one section and you'll see how beautiful it is 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.350
 looks like it is vertically positioned 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.479
 on the wall 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.460
 cool we'll see the finished shelf 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.550
 check everything properly before we 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.789
 come to our finished sample 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.520
 I apply plenty of glue to 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:59.510
 attach it 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:04.580
 finished product there let's go of course 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.320
 come on please look well look 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.300
 what we get and purple 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.570
 red yellow green is missing only 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.510
 blue almost rainbow yes we are here 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.750
 with such a slight movement we press down 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.060
 below the remaining element hold 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.280
 him and as a result we get this 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.410
 here's a vertical wand 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.330
 and don't think it 's done and say 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.800
 but a mystery to your neighbors friends 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.389
 who often come to visit you 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.880
 as you see our vertical shelf 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.350
 ready to eat just a pair of good shoes 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.130
 slippers which we can here 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.470
 place 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.660
 how much point is solid enough 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.669
 since we are well bonded good 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.580
 reliable glue plus any paintwork 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.830
 the cover is reinforced originally cardboard so 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.480
 that for slippers and even if you make them 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.860
 larger size for winter shoes 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.380
 strength of this cardboard 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.090
 hi tell me enough vole like 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.880
 do it right in this hole to 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.800
 secure the shoe rack to the wall in 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.230
 the top section of our shelves we do 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.980
 holes thanks to ordinary knife 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.360
 or for example scissors so that was not 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.490
 the feeling of being so careless 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.530
 cut off we specially decorated 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.000
 as you see with twine and thanks to him 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.400
 Look at the whole structure of ours. 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.500
 it can easily be removed and moved to 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.090
 any part of our corridor is very 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.070
 convenient here is the distance to 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.660
 distance must be at least 2 3 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.520
 centimeters because it's all the same 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.889
 cardboard if it is much smaller 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.229
 just breaks and our whole regiment 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.930
 will fall I really like my new 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.910
 the regiment now we know how from ordinary 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.840
 make a cardboard box very comfortable 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.840
 shoe rack
