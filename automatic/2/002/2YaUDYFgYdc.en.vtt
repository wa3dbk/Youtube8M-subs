of the things that we used to think was

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.929 
died with this was based on the idea

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
hundred years and they did a study on

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.410 
hundred years and they did a study on
hundred<00:02:26.189> year<00:02:26.400> olds<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.790> found<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.239> this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
hundred year olds and found that this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.780 
hundred year olds and found that this
change<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> brain<00:02:28.469> is<00:02:28.739> continuous<00:02:29.430> even

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
change in the brain is continuous even

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.009 
change in the brain is continuous even
then<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.420> call<00:02:30.689> this<00:02:30.930> change<00:02:31.290> plasticity<00:02:33.019> now

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
then we call this change plasticity now

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.379 
then we call this change plasticity now
in<00:02:34.409> order<00:02:34.859> for<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.159> brain<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.879> able<00:02:36.239> to

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
in order for the brain to be able to

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.750 
in order for the brain to be able to
become<00:02:36.569> more<00:02:37.019> complex<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.799> maintain<00:02:38.430> its

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
become more complex and maintain its

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.929 
become more complex and maintain its
function<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.900> has<00:02:40.109> to<00:02:40.319> be<00:02:40.469> fed<00:02:40.739> properly<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
function it has to be fed properly it

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.990 
function it has to be fed properly it
has<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.359> have<00:02:42.540> adequate<00:02:43.079> rest<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.639> has<00:02:44.819> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
has to have adequate rest and it has to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.899 
has to have adequate rest and it has to
avoid<00:02:45.269> certain<00:02:45.720> toxins<00:02:46.519> now<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.609> thing

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
avoid certain toxins now the thing

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.330 
avoid certain toxins now the thing
that's<00:02:48.389> most<00:02:48.629> important<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.590> feeding<00:02:50.189> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that's most important is feeding the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.899 
that's most important is feeding the
brain<00:02:50.579> properly<00:02:51.180> giving<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.139> it<00:02:52.290> needs

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
brain properly giving it what it needs

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.330 
brain properly giving it what it needs
we<00:02:53.909> know<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> brain<00:02:54.720> requires<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:56.010> lot<00:02:56.310> of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
we know that the brain requires a lot of

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.149 
we know that the brain requires a lot of
sugar<00:02:57.030> what<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.659> call<00:02:57.930> glucose<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:59.010> its

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
sugar what we call glucose for its

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.539 
sugar what we call glucose for its
function<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.419> its<00:03:00.629> main<00:03:00.900> fuel<00:03:01.469> at<00:03:02.250> least

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
function that is its main fuel at least

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.800 
function that is its main fuel at least
80%<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:04.469> brain's<00:03:04.739> fuel<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.459> glucose<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
80% of the brain's fuel is glucose it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.289 
80% of the brain's fuel is glucose it
gets<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.409> glucose<00:03:08.010> by<00:03:08.310> metabolizing

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
gets this glucose by metabolizing

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.770 
gets this glucose by metabolizing
complex<00:03:09.870> carbohydrates<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:12.120> also<00:03:12.299> know<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
complex carbohydrates we also know that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.110 
complex carbohydrates we also know that
the<00:03:13.049> brain<00:03:13.260> requires<00:03:13.859> some<00:03:14.129> very<00:03:14.159> complex

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the brain requires some very complex

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.449 
the brain requires some very complex
molecules<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.109> order<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.500> function<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.159> that

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
molecules in order to function and that

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.899 
molecules in order to function and that
it<00:03:17.549> gets<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:18.030> molecules<00:03:18.659> from<00:03:18.959> our<00:03:19.169> food

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
it gets these molecules from our food

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.420 
it gets these molecules from our food
now<00:03:20.909> if<00:03:21.150> we're<00:03:21.329> not<00:03:21.510> eating<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.169> diet<00:03:22.409> that<00:03:22.949> is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
now if we're not eating a diet that is

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.729 
now if we're not eating a diet that is
consistent<00:03:24.269> with<00:03:24.299> supplying<00:03:24.959> these<00:03:25.349> things

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
consistent with supplying these things

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.949 
consistent with supplying these things
that<00:03:25.979> the<00:03:26.099> brain<00:03:26.370> needs<00:03:26.400> our<00:03:27.209> brain<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.780> not

that the brain needs our brain is not

that the brain needs our brain is not
going<00:03:28.169> to<00:03:28.229> function<00:03:28.500> properly<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:30.180> can

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
going to function properly this can

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.979 
going to function properly this can
translate<00:03:30.689> into<00:03:31.229> such<00:03:31.590> things<00:03:31.949> as<00:03:32.220> insomnia

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
translate into such things as insomnia

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.990 
translate into such things as insomnia
difficulty<00:03:33.989> thinking<00:03:34.199> clearly<00:03:35.000> having

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
difficulty thinking clearly having

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.420 
difficulty thinking clearly having

difficulty with our memory difficulty
with<00:03:38.579> their<00:03:38.729> speech<00:03:39.229> so<00:03:40.229> we<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:40.739> that<00:03:40.919> it<00:03:41.069> can

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
with their speech so we see that it can

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.039 
with their speech so we see that it can
have<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> profound<00:03:41.760> effect<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:42.840> also

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
have a profound effect it can also

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.170 
have a profound effect it can also
affect<00:03:43.349> our<00:03:43.859> behavior<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.699> know<00:03:44.970> that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
affect our behavior we know that

affect our behavior we know that
