00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
getting the feeling that it might be a

getting the feeling that it might be a
older<00:01:12.689> Call<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> Duty<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> mean<00:01:14.369> by

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

that like Nautica not a futuristic Call
of<00:01:16.530> Duty<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> favor<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

sure we'll find out for sure but you
know<00:01:28.829> there's<00:01:29.040> been<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> hints

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
know there's been some kind of hints

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.899 
know there's been some kind of hints
here<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.909> older

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
here and there that it could be a older

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
here and there that it could be a older
Call<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> Duty<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.020> cool<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
Call of Duty so that would be cool and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.039 
Call of Duty so that would be cool and
then<00:01:35.220> also<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> actual<00:01:36.570> trailer<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770 
1 on it and obviously black ops 1 was
older<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> there's<00:01:42.450> there's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
older so I don't know there's there's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.120 
older so I don't know there's there's
been<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> few<00:01:43.170> hints<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
been a few hints here and there that it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.830 
been a few hints here and there that it
could<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.430> older<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.270> kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> what

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
could be older and that's kind of what

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.649 
could be older and that's kind of what
I'm<00:01:46.040> preferring<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.390> we'll<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I'm preferring so you know we'll have to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.850 
I'm preferring so you know we'll have to
wait<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.590> pretty

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
wait and see but that would be pretty

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
wait and see but that would be pretty
cool<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.220> well<00:01:50.270> also<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> last<00:01:51.720> thing<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> want

about it then the call of duty' twitter
uploaded<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.560> kind<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.739> weird<00:02:25.920> that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
uploaded it so it's kind of weird that

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.770 
uploaded it so it's kind of weird that
they<00:02:26.129> let<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> youtubers<00:02:26.849> announce<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.569> first

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
they let the youtubers announce it first

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.539 
they let the youtubers announce it first
I<00:02:28.110> don't<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.409> you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.129> just<00:02:29.280> part

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
I don't know you know that's just part

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.680 
I don't know you know that's just part
of<00:02:29.580> their<00:02:29.700> marketing<00:02:30.060> campaign<00:02:30.480> or<00:02:30.510> whatever

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
of their marketing campaign or whatever

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.119 
of their marketing campaign or whatever
that<00:02:30.959> was<00:02:31.080> pretty<00:02:31.260> unique<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:31.769> haven't<00:02:32.040> ever

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
that was pretty unique they haven't ever

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.789 
that was pretty unique they haven't ever
done<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.340> before<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
done that before so I think that like I

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.259 
done that before so I think that like I
don't<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.129> like<00:02:35.310> obviously<00:02:35.670> confirmation

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
don't have like obviously confirmation

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.150 
don't have like obviously confirmation
on<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:36.660> definitely<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.739> all<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
on this but definitely like all the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.830 
on this but definitely like all the
youtubers<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.640> uploaded<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.330> before<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
youtubers that uploaded it before the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930 
youtubers that uploaded it before the
call<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.110> duty<00:02:40.349> Twitter<00:02:40.590> I'm<00:02:41.160> assuming<00:02:41.819> they

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
call of duty Twitter I'm assuming they

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.399 
call of duty Twitter I'm assuming they
knew<00:02:42.150> about<00:02:42.420> they<00:02:42.569> at<00:02:42.690> least<00:02:42.780> knew<00:02:43.019> about<00:02:43.140> it

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
knew about they at least knew about it

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.990 
knew about they at least knew about it
for<00:02:43.620> today<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> don't<00:02:44.220> know<00:02:44.280> how<00:02:44.489> long<00:02:44.760> they've

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
for today I don't know how long they've

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.309 
for today I don't know how long they've
known<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:45.989> they've<00:02:46.110> probably

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
known about it I think they've probably

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.199 
known about it I think they've probably
known<00:02:46.590> about<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.129> few<00:02:47.340> days<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.790> would

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
known about it for a few days I would

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.699 
known about it for a few days I would
assume<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.720> around<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.110> point<00:02:49.379> when<00:02:49.590> they

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
assume right around the point when they

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
assume right around the point when they
changed<00:02:50.129> their<00:02:50.280> Twitter<00:02:50.579> avatars<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.690> like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
changed their Twitter avatars to like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.420 
changed their Twitter avatars to like
the<00:02:51.989> black<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> Ember<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.190> stuff

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
the black with like the Ember and stuff

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.759 
the black with like the Ember and stuff
so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> guess<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.750> they've<00:02:54.989> known<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.560> this

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
so I guess like they've known like this

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.530 
so I guess like they've known like this
whole<00:02:55.950> time<00:02:56.190> they<00:02:56.579> just<00:02:56.819> obviously<00:02:57.180> they<00:02:57.329> had

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
whole time they just obviously they had

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.780 
whole time they just obviously they had
probably<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.900> non-disclosure<00:02:58.859> agreement

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
probably a non-disclosure agreement

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.460 
probably a non-disclosure agreement
where<00:03:00.060> they<00:03:00.180> couldn't<00:03:00.480> talk<00:03:00.660> about<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
where they couldn't talk about it or you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.780 
where they couldn't talk about it or you
know<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.829> could<00:03:02.010> get<00:03:02.129> in<00:03:02.220> trouble<00:03:02.609> but

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
know they could get in trouble but
