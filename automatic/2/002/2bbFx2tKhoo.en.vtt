00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello a great greeting to all also without 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 YouTube subscribers are in a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 tutorial of alcan blogs in this tutorial 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.509
 I showed them a way to be able 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.339
 install an operating system 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.890
 virtually called ios what good is 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.080
 as if we had an ipad tablet in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.870
 our computer managing the system 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.600
 operative of uncles in this case the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 program is called ay fabiÃ¡n what good is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 a free software that provides us 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 a page and well this is the way 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 to be able to install this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.609
 application that handles them in our 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.680
 computer and good obviously 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.460
 virtually and good to download it 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.949
 we have to go to my page 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 blogs.intel.com we will go to the section 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 of downloads and below we will find 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.979
 the image of ipad already in 2.0 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.440
 this time we will handle 27 and good 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.490
 they unload them so that they have this 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.220
 error 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.649
 that we will open and we will find 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.570
 with the application of records 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.210
 we are going to extract it here in 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.979
 the desk will be good 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.890
 Before starting the installation, you have to 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.020
 create a folder anywhere in 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.789
 our desk for example already 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 I will explain a little bit later because in 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.979
 this case I'll put you there could 2 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.140
 there is then good once you 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.509
 have created and I will explain later 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.520
 so we will use it we are going to 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.729
 run the executable here from 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.920
 file that we decompress for 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.640
 start installing what would be our 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.399
 application and be able to run virtually 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.799
 they are going here in script 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.009
 because we are going to install applications 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.860
 we do not want to decline and good 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.860
 will begin to download what would be 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 case file 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 and when it's finished we have to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.880
 start the installation now yes once 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.190
 that has been downloaded we give in next and 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.620
 here we are going to choose the folder that 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.200
 we believe in the good desktop as 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.270
 have created let's choose in this case 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.220
 is this because because that's where 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.320
 is going to address the program it's as if 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 it was a route that we have to choose 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.070
 so that it is installed but good what 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.230
 would believe something like portable so 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.720
 say it, do not give in to accept 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.209
 and here the route was changed then it 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 we give in next and it's going to start 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.190
 install what would be the program is going 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.690
 to start saving here in the folder and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.330
 well let's see what is a process 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.159
 quick to notice so much and good here too 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.420
 we have to install what would be adobe 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.950
 flash player do not have it installed and in 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.629
 If you have it, you will not ask 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.430
 the installation but good here as no 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.190
 I had installed it is the installation 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.329
 in progress he says he has finished ready and 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.040
 when the 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.549
 installation completely we are going to give 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.549
 in finish 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.709
 and well, it will automatically open for us 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.290
 that would be the application as we see here 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.810
 is the nest 7 good is like a 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.180
 invitation you will see I do not know exactly but 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.730
 well it looks a lot quite then 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.349
 let's start exploring here for is and 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.719
 Here I will give you on YouTube to open 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.980
 the youtube application will click and 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.870
 well here we are going to start what 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.430
 would be the mobile application if we 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.859
 we put the mobile we see that it is the same 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 application and recent videos 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.049
 we can also here access our 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.189
 account some settings and so on we can 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:50.349
 look for a video here let's throw I do not know 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.349
 why until the field then 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.989
 good here will be the videos as if 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.449
 outside the mobile application and good 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.040
 to return now yes to what would be 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.199
 the interface we are going to click here to the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.329
 corner and we will return again here 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.220
 the interface we can see also that there 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.200
 various applications like photoshop 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.800
 let's open it and when it would be a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.960
 mobile photoshop as it would be in a god 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.209
 that we can give ifa the image no to 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.700
 open it up well these things that you 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.590
 here they move him and good something of the most 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.240
 important is the app store you 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.250
 you can ask if you can download 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.650
 any application or game just like 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.750
 appears in children as an ipad tablet or 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.360
 ipod and good the answer is yes 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.370
 Of course you can here I say no 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.960
 they can all but they do not appear 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.180
 some are going to be updated 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.580
 constantly applications and games 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.140
 in this case we see a few 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.420
 as instagram instagram maiden fifa 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.700
 plants against zombies two always round 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.860
 and good in this case I will download 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.180
 here to a test with what the road 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.169
 click 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.419
 and says that the charges you have finished 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.919
 the download is pretty fast then 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.610
 good as it's finished it's going to 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.530
 open and we will see that the application will start 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.199
 and good it will be practically as if 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.770
 you were in the god and here you can 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.529
 handle it 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.780
 let's see here 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.820
 level 1 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.030
 and will start to give what would be the 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.030
 application 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.080
 you have to cut it in the stars 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.850
 and good we will begin to act what 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 it would be our application that we have 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.650
 open then good to be able to close 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.230
 the good thing is that you here move him and 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.820
 know what functions it has in explaining 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.410
 each of them because they would 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.270
 something irksome then go our 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.540
 things that you here move him to 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.180
 close it we will have to click here 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.770
 as if our application were turned off and 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.370
 well the folder that we created is 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.470
 they installed what would be good to us 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.660
 they installed two here applications that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.850
 it would be uninstall it this is very 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.670
 important not to eliminate them because 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.430
 if you delete this folder you are not going to 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.930
 you can uninstall in if 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.170
 you want to uninstall they asked for the 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.370
 application can no longer be uninstalled 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.500
 so it's very important that the 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.750
 keep and you can even move it from 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.020
 place if it bothers you at the desk what 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.490
 you can move from somewhere where 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.080
 you know that it does not bother you in case you can 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.700
 move a program file and there you do not 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.100
 clog but jokes that not the 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.930
 delete good this will be all I hope that 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.570
 you liked it remember that good 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.310
 here you can use your virtual or 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.020
 virtually ios 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.090
 and well something that I also have to 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.840
 tell them is that in this one in this case 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.030
 we are using 27 already know that they will leave 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.010
 new updates by silvio so 8 and 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.640
 19 but I'm talking about the date 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.530
 current 2013 but good in case 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.830
 come out new updates will have to 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.540
 update it since there is not this in case 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.600
 a new version comes out which is what 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.610
 happened in the n-6 was delayed then the 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.610
 App Store application no longer worked 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.310
 for ios 6 if it was not updated for ios 7 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.400
 and good in case it comes out and 28 no longer 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.110
 will work 27 because when the 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.180
 servers change and that's why 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.400
 they should update what in case they 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.570
 come out the new advance update 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.460
 It will be everything I hope you liked it 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.890
 I leave my facebook twitter banner 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.170
 skype my website to follow me 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.850
