00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
somehow even though my MK 48 was a new

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.759 
somehow even though my MK 48 was a new
level<00:00:19.380> 3<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.010> somehow<00:00:21.080> had<00:00:22.080> laser<00:00:22.470> sight

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769

yeah so useful i guess for stuff like
the<00:01:39.659> FAL<00:01:40.110> um<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.560> if

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the FAL um if you want to you know if

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
the FAL um if you want to you know if
you<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.369> used<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> select<00:01:45.450> fire

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you really used to the select fire

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
you really used to the select fire
attachment<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.250> want<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
attachment and you don't want to have to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
attachment and you don't want to have to
lose<00:01:47.880> area<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.600> maybe<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.530> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
lose area or maybe some of you just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440 
lose area or maybe some of you just
really<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.280> them<00:01:50.399> amita<00:01:50.759> scope<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
really like them amita scope all the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
really like them amita scope all the
grenade<00:01:51.720> launcher<00:01:52.399> then<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:54.000> i<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.299> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
grenade launcher then but i don't really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.490 
grenade launcher then but i don't really
think<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> cause<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.380> much

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
think this is going to cause to much

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.499 
think this is going to cause to much
problems<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.790> you'll<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.939> patched<00:01:57.270> at

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
problems I think you'll be patched at

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
problems I think you'll be patched at
some<00:01:57.659> point<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:59.070> white<00:01:59.250> guys<00:01:59.490> what

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
some point but if you're white guys what

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
some point but if you're white guys what
happened<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.979> get

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
happened with it you know if you get

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
happened with it you know if you get
banned<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.790> using<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.240> that's<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.630> really

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
banned from using it that's not really
