00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.900
 ruslan provodnikov the most dangerous of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.559
 everyone 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.889
 the russian ruslan provodnikov has been a 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.530
 good boxer but after that 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.949
 lost a closed decision in March 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.840
 of this year against the champion walter 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.470
 timothy bradley in an exciting 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.009
 battle no doubt that he has won in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.950
 confidence he showed yesterday in denver 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.430
 colorado in front of the mexican american mike 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 alvarado in own house of this one 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.360
 ruslan practically overwhelmed his rival 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.490
 who lost his fight by not going out in the 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.940
 assault 11 due to the great punishment 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.940
 received the energy and the push 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.030
 shown by the Russian are not very things 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.730
 common in today's boxing without much 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.240
 technique or defense and with a style of going 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.820
 Always wear seems forward 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.820
 to their rivals who are going 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.360
 demolishing with accurate and powerful 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.490
 blows in yesterday's fight 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 alvarado started very well marking 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.970
 pretty with your key 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.000
 going to Russian almost always and for a while 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.150
 exchanging in the short however to 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.120
 since he felt his blows that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.820
 they seem to take dynamite the balance is 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.460
 tilted on one side provodnikov 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.190
 after the fifth round he began to poke 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.010
 more accurately its fast hooks to the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.380
 liver and face combined with 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.680
 forehands that were left exhausted to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.680
 an alvarado that already in the eighth suffered 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.259
 two falls thereafter the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.810
 pressure of the Russian was unbearable and mike 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.509
 ended with his right cheekbone 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.180
 extremely inflamed ruslan instead 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.180
 to behave like a Siberian rocky 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.520
 which is what they call it looks more like a 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.619
 hungry lion on the ring already what 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.380
 we have mentioned in other occasions 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.360
 now he is the new world champion of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.600
 the superligeros in the organization 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.019
 world boxing and it seems to be the option 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 more dangerous for the boxers of the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.900
 elite I mean men like pacquiao 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 own bradley and mayweather in the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.780
 as well as dani garcÃ­a or adrien broner 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.480
 example in the superligeros 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.060
 some of these stars after seeing 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.489
 the last fights of this Russian 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.430
 maybe they would think twice for 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.819
 to face it then to overcome it, 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.760
 that employ the best of boxing and all 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.239
 the possible energy to counteract 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.140
 someone who seems tireless and who 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.909
 moments seems immutable to the blows 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.780
 Without a doubt 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.120
