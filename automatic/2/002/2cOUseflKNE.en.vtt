00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
hit this middle one this is what's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.330 
hit this middle one this is what's
actually<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> download<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> file<00:01:29.130> for

okay<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:38.759> Android<00:01:39.680> SDK<00:01:40.680> slim<00:01:41.100> zip<00:01:41.670> I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
okay so we got Android SDK slim zip I'm

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.550 
okay so we got Android SDK slim zip I'm
going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> show<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.450> folder<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.320> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
going to show in folder so we can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.319 
going to show in folder so we can
navigate<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.000> what's<00:01:45.210> going

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to look like make sure it's Android STK

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.630 
to look like make sure it's Android STK
slim<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> father<00:01:48.960> t1<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.520> make

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
slim this is the father t1 to make

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
slim this is the father t1 to make
things<00:01:50.880> easier<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> navigate<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.530> going

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and I'm going to drag it over here drop

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
and I'm going to drag it over here drop
it<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.640> find<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.939> whenever

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
it here so that we can find it whenever
