00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 so osvaldo left home just to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 photograph the arrival of vlt wagons 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.949
 from the baja santotista 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
 he was a resident of the saints. 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 public transport user 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 even taking car you prefer to use the bus 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 or subway because it saves on fuel and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 parkings 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.260
 now he is eager to experiment 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.149
 the new vlt of the baja santotista 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 mainly is very poor in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.360
 public transportation issue right then 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 is to ask that it will be very important yes 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 but without a revolution down here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 will walk the old is better run out 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 doubt 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.430
 I hope to get it on the first 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.789
 trip 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.520
 the inauguration was almost a month for 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.890
 the wagons of the vlt light vehicle on 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.989
 rails to reach the port of santos 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.700
 they came from spain are being 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.990
 homes in san vicente alicante 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 Santista 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.510
 every old tds will be able to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.430
 400 users per trip to the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.170
 population around our station 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 lady of the graces where she was 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.200
 made the vehicle assembly was well 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.869
 curious 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.790
 all wanting to understand the logistics 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.280
 After all, there were several 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 place the vehicle on rails 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 for the resident of the region and roni da 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 and this represents prosperity. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.290
 because you always see this kind of transport 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.119
 In other countries 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 so it's a joy to see you coming now 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 in Brazil but believes to be very 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.409
 important to raise awareness of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.390
 users for the preservation of it I think 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.060
 whereas the population 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.700
 adam has to help the team maintain this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.030
 Because we see what happens today. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.940
 with the allowances that the buses 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.800
 upholstery ripped rabi state is so 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.380
 He needs to see something already. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.369
 It's really cool, our city needs to be 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.369
 keep it from there
