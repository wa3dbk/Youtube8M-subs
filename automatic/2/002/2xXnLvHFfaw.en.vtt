00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
share my thoughts let's get into it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.040 
share my thoughts let's get into it
for<00:00:26.970> starters<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.510> said<00:00:27.660> retails<00:00:28.019> for

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
for starters like I said retails for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
for starters like I said retails for
three<00:00:28.260> dollars<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.039> some<00:00:29.460> shade<00:00:29.699> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
three dollars it is in some shade of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
three dollars it is in some shade of
black<00:00:30.000> black<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.630> black<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> truth<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
black black is black but the truth is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
black black is black but the truth is
there<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.340> shape<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> line<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
there is only one shape in this line so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
there is only one shape in this line so
far<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.680> sets<00:00:34.920> us<00:00:35.040> apart<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:35.430> other

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
far and what sets us apart from other

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
far and what sets us apart from other
felt-tip<00:00:36.120> liners<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.350> elf<00:00:37.530> cosmetics

felt-tip liners in the elf cosmetics
liner<00:00:38.460> line<00:00:38.790> overall<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:40.440> dramatically

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
liner line overall is how dramatically

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010 
liner line overall is how dramatically
this<00:00:41.489> tip<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.910> tapered<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this tip is tapered you can see it is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.360 
this tip is tapered you can see it is
significantly<00:00:43.620> chubbier

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
significantly chubbier

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
significantly chubbier
than<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> average<00:00:45.120> felt<00:00:45.390> tip<00:00:45.600> liner<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.200> once

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
than the average felt tip liner but once

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
than the average felt tip liner but once
you<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.620> really<00:00:46.890> close<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you get really close up in there you can

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.049 
you get really close up in there you can
see<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> tip<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.200> pretty<00:00:49.980> large<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.789> well

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
see that the tip is pretty large as well

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
see that the tip is pretty large as well
fortunately<00:00:51.809> though<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.440> rigid<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
fortunately though it's not rigid it is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.400 
fortunately though it's not rigid it is
super<00:00:53.399> flexible<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.050> feel<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
super flexible and so you really feel a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
super flexible and so you really feel a
nice<00:00:55.710> soft<00:00:56.039> texture<00:00:56.460> across<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:57.030> lid<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
nice soft texture across your lid it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
nice soft texture across your lid it
doesn't<00:00:57.870> drag<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.890> rough<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
doesn't drag it's not so rough and I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.650 
doesn't drag it's not so rough and I
think<00:00:59.670> you'll<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> able<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> demo

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
think you'll be able to see in the demo

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
think you'll be able to see in the demo
that<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> drags<00:01:01.620> your<00:01:01.829> eyelid<00:01:02.219> along

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
that it kind of drags your eyelid along

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
that it kind of drags your eyelid along
with<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.170> case<00:01:04.350> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
with it which is really good in case you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
with it which is really good in case you
have<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> sensitive<00:01:05.519> eyelids<00:01:06.030> sometimes

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have kind of sensitive eyelids sometimes

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.810 
have kind of sensitive eyelids sometimes
those<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.350> sensitive<00:01:07.890> skin<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.250> general

those with sensitive skin in general

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
those with sensitive skin in general
have<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.600> you're<00:01:09.689> clear<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> felt-tip

liners go to something like a brush or a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
liners go to something like a brush or a
rubberized<00:01:13.110> tip<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.189> felt<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.670> just

said<00:01:26.159> wanted<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.420> few<00:01:27.659> weeks

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
said wanted to use this for a few weeks

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.530 
said wanted to use this for a few weeks
because<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> pretty<00:01:29.100> prominent<00:01:29.549> issue<00:01:29.820> not

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because it is pretty prominent issue not

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
because it is pretty prominent issue not
just<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.900> elfs<00:01:31.200> felt<00:01:31.409> tip<00:01:31.590> liner<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.040> felt

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
just with elfs felt tip liner but felt

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
just with elfs felt tip liner but felt
tip<00:01:32.430> liners<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.909> general<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.049> say

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
tip liners in general really have to say

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
tip liners in general really have to say
that<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.409> has<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.950> dried<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that it has not dried out so far and it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.469 
that it has not dried out so far and it
lays<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.350> nice<00:01:38.150> somewhat<00:01:39.150> opaque

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
lays down a really nice somewhat opaque

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
lays down a really nice somewhat opaque
line<00:01:39.810> you'll<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> demo<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
line you'll see in the demo that it is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
line you'll see in the demo that it is
relatively<00:01:42.210> opaque<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
relatively opaque but to get like the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
relatively opaque but to get like the
blackest<00:01:43.979> black<00:01:44.130> pigmentation<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.090> find<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
blackest black pigmentation I do find I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
blackest black pigmentation I do find I
have<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:45.960> over<00:01:46.200> those<00:01:46.350> lines<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.979> few

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
have to go over those lines a few

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
have to go over those lines a few
different<00:01:47.640> times<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.869> eventually<00:01:49.140> does

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
different times but it eventually does

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
different times but it eventually does
build<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.220> opacity<00:01:51.000> speaking<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
build up to that opacity speaking of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
build up to that opacity speaking of
actually<00:01:52.079> putting<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.680> into<00:01:52.860> use<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
actually putting it into use I have to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.170 
actually putting it into use I have to
say<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.450> tend<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> prefer<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
say that I tend to prefer this kind of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
say that I tend to prefer this kind of
felt<00:01:57.420> tip<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.710> other<00:01:58.890> felt<00:01:59.159> tips<00:01:59.340> I've

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
felt tip over the other felt tips I've

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
felt tip over the other felt tips I've
tried<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.820> ELF<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.270> felt<00:02:00.540> tips<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> general

tried from ELF or felt tips in general

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
tried from ELF or felt tips in general
that<00:02:01.770> dramatically<00:02:02.310> tapered<00:02:02.790> tip<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that dramatically tapered tip and the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
that dramatically tapered tip and the
flexibility<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.619> on

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
flexibility that you get on

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
flexibility that you get on
the<00:02:04.920> end<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.190> that<00:02:05.370> tip<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.360> makes<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.780> easy

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the end of that tip really makes it easy

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.870 
the end of that tip really makes it easy
to<00:02:07.230> lay<00:02:07.440> down<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.680> nice<00:02:07.980> line<00:02:08.340> whether<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
to lay down a nice line whether it is

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940 
to lay down a nice line whether it is
you<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:09.270> an<00:02:09.780> ultra<00:02:10.320> thin<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.710> know<00:02:10.740> you're

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you want an ultra thin you know you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
you want an ultra thin you know you're
not<00:02:11.039> even<00:02:11.340> trying<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> Cateye<00:02:12.240> but

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
not even trying to go for a Cateye but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.750 
not even trying to go for a Cateye but
you<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.960> want<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.010> thinnest<00:02:14.460> but

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you just want this the thinnest but

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760 
you just want this the thinnest but
opaque<00:02:15.150> line<00:02:15.600> across<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.320> upper<00:02:16.350> lash<00:02:16.740> line

opaque line across your upper lash line
this<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.760> great<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> same

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
this is great for that but at the same

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.630 
this is great for that but at the same
time<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.470> also<00:02:19.590> great<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.130> relatively

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
time it's also great for this relatively

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400 
time it's also great for this relatively
dramatic<00:02:21.150> cat<00:02:21.390> eye<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.810> I'm<00:02:21.900> wearing<00:02:22.230> right

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
dramatic cat eye that I'm wearing right

now<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:23.280> far<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.520> lasting<00:02:23.940> power<00:02:24.060> goes<00:02:24.360> I'd<00:02:24.630> say

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
now as far as lasting power goes I'd say

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960 
now as far as lasting power goes I'd say
I'm<00:02:25.110> pretty<00:02:25.260> impressed<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.400> forgot<00:02:26.850> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
I'm pretty impressed I have I forgot to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.030 
I'm pretty impressed I have I forgot to
take<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.120> before<00:02:27.450> picture<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.260> did<00:02:28.530> take<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
take a before picture but I did take a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.449 
take a before picture but I did take a
nine<00:02:29.430> hour<00:02:29.760> after<00:02:30.330> shot<00:02:30.600> right<00:02:31.290> before<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> shot

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
nine hour after shot right before I shot

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.010 
nine hour after shot right before I shot
this<00:02:32.670> video<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.209> actually<00:02:33.480> touched<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.870> and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
this video and actually touched up and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.510 
this video and actually touched up and
they<00:02:34.080> my<00:02:34.260> eyeliner<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.830> little<00:02:35.250> bit<00:02:35.370> more

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
they my eyeliner a little bit more

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.070 
they my eyeliner a little bit more
dramatic<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.209> after<00:02:36.600> shot<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.990> think

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
dramatic but that after shot I think

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.260 
dramatic but that after shot I think
says<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> lot<00:02:37.620> about<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> liner<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.430> applied<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
says a lot about the liner I applied it

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.000 
says a lot about the liner I applied it
without<00:02:39.510> primer<00:02:39.900> without<00:02:40.380> powder<00:02:40.680> that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
without primer without powder that

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
without primer without powder that
anything<00:02:41.400> over<00:02:41.459> my<00:02:41.700> lids<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.300> withstood

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
anything over my lids and it withstood

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.270 
anything over my lids and it withstood
the<00:02:43.110> test<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.530> time

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the test of time

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
the test of time
I've<00:02:44.340> also<00:02:44.760> warned<00:02:45.180> over<00:02:45.330> powders<00:02:45.900> over

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I've also warned over powders over

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.900 
I've also warned over powders over
primers<00:02:46.770> over<00:02:47.100> anything<00:02:47.400> else<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.760> might

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
primers over anything else you might

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.699 
primers over anything else you might
want<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.120> put<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:48.420> your<00:02:48.540> lids<00:02:48.810> cream<00:02:49.200> shadows

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709

want to put on your lids cream shadows
and<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.220> lasted<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.390> well<00:02:51.570> if<00:02:51.780> not

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
and it lasted really really well if not

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720 
and it lasted really really well if not
better<00:02:52.200> obviously<00:02:52.500> over<00:02:53.130> those<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.580> you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
better obviously over those because you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.430 
better obviously over those because you
have<00:02:54.030> something<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.660> actually<00:02:54.870> creating

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
have something that's actually creating

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.830 
have something that's actually creating

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
a nice clean pristine base for it to

this<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.739> kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.010> had<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.160> ask<00:03:11.370> myself<00:03:11.580> why

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
this I kind of had to ask myself why

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.020 
this I kind of had to ask myself why
choose<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:13.230> particular<00:03:13.670> pen

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
choose this particular pen

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.180 
choose this particular pen
over<00:03:15.269> any<00:03:15.480> other<00:03:15.690> kind<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.080> liner<00:03:16.380> elf<00:03:16.739> offers

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
over any other kind of liner elf offers

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.800 
over any other kind of liner elf offers
because<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.640> have<00:03:17.970> cheaper<00:03:18.450> liquid

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
because they do have cheaper liquid

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.539 
because they do have cheaper liquid
liners<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.650> other<00:03:19.890> felt-tip

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
liners and they have other felt-tip

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.070 
liners and they have other felt-tip
liners<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.330> wanted<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.690> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.930> go

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
liners and so I wanted to kind of go

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.840 
liners and so I wanted to kind of go
through<00:03:22.320> my<00:03:22.440> experiences<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.130> those<00:03:23.340> give

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
through my experiences with those give

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130 
through my experiences with those give
you<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> pros<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.390> cons<00:03:24.420> why<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.840> might<00:03:25.019> pick

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
you the pros the cons why you might pick

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.229 
you the pros the cons why you might pick
this<00:03:25.260> one<00:03:25.410> over<00:03:25.739> those<00:03:25.920> other<00:03:26.100> liners<00:03:26.760> as<00:03:27.060> well

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
this one over those other liners as well

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.699 
this one over those other liners as well
first<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.750> all<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.080> said<00:03:28.260> already<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
first of all like I said already the

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.289 
first of all like I said already the
tapered<00:03:29.010> tip<00:03:29.160> really<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:29.970> sets<00:03:30.209> this

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
tapered tip really is what sets this

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.449 
tapered tip really is what sets this
apart<00:03:30.360> from<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.900> entire<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.590> lighter<00:03:31.920> line

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
apart from the entire of lighter line

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.250 
apart from the entire of lighter line
the<00:03:32.790> shape<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.390> totally<00:03:33.780> unique<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the shape is totally unique to the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.229 
the shape is totally unique to the
collection<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.890> stuff<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.670> fact<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.120> think

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
collection and stuff and in fact I think

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.900 
collection and stuff and in fact I think
makes<00:03:37.080> application<00:03:37.680> easier<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.670> like

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
makes application easier so if you like

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.310 
makes application easier so if you like
felt-tip<00:03:39.330> liners<00:03:39.690> but<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.930> sometimes

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
felt-tip liners but you sometimes

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.420 
felt-tip liners but you sometimes
struggle<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.890> need<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.070> little<00:03:41.160> more

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
struggle you need a little more

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.580 
struggle you need a little more
flexibility<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.480> softer<00:03:42.989> felt<00:03:43.200> tip<00:03:43.410> because

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
flexibility a softer felt tip because

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.560 
flexibility a softer felt tip because
this<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.830> honestly<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.340> softest<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:44.910> felt<00:03:45.299> from

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
this is honestly the softest I felt from

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.750 
this is honestly the softest I felt from
ELF<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.530> would<00:03:46.739> be<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> good<00:03:47.160> alternative<00:03:47.340> for

ELF this would be a good alternative for

ELF this would be a good alternative for
you<00:03:48.180> one<00:03:48.989> reason<00:03:49.140> why<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.410> might<00:03:49.560> choose<00:03:49.830> a

liner like elf liquid eye liner this by

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.650 
liner like elf liquid eye liner this by
the<00:03:55.230> way<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.370> was<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.610> limited<00:03:57.090> edition<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
the way is it was a limited edition it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.960 
the way is it was a limited edition it
was<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> holiday<00:03:58.350> line<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.850> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
was like a holiday line but this is the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.550 
was like a holiday line but this is the
general<00:04:00.269> idea<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.660> this<00:04:00.930> liner<00:04:01.230> it's

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
general idea of this liner it's

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.710 
general idea of this liner it's
basically<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:02.010> potted<00:04:02.579> liquid<00:04:02.880> liner<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.510> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
basically a potted liquid liner and it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720 
basically a potted liquid liner and it
has<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:04.079> brush<00:04:04.350> here<00:04:04.709> on<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.070> end

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
has a brush here on the end

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.729 
has a brush here on the end
of<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.970> applicator<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.379> thing<00:04:07.590> with

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
of the applicator and the thing with

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.070 
of the applicator and the thing with
these<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> great<00:04:08.940> liner<00:04:09.300> not<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
these this is a great liner not just the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.780 
these this is a great liner not just the
silver<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.739> black<00:04:10.950> performs

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
silver but like the black performs

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.030 
silver but like the black performs
really<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.450> well<00:04:12.629> and<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:12.989> truly<00:04:13.890> one

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
really really well and it is truly one

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.979 
really really well and it is truly one
of<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.190> most<00:04:14.250> budge<00:04:14.610> proof<00:04:14.640> liquid<00:04:15.629> liners

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
of the most budge proof liquid liners

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.560 
of the most budge proof liquid liners
I've<00:04:16.139> ever<00:04:16.260> tried<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.850> get<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> little<00:04:18.479> bit

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
I've ever tried but you get a little bit

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.990 
I've ever tried but you get a little bit
less<00:04:18.810> control<00:04:19.380> with<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.040> brush<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.790> brush

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
less control with the brush the brush

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
less control with the brush the brush
can<00:04:21.180> sometimes<00:04:21.540> pick<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.959> lot<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.199> products

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
can sometimes pick up a lot of products

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.620 
can sometimes pick up a lot of products
and<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.040> gets<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.729> little<00:04:23.940> out<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.150> control

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
and that gets a little out of control

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.620 
and that gets a little out of control
sometimes<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:26.460> last<00:04:26.790> time<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> tried<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
sometimes and the last time I tried the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.600 
sometimes and the last time I tried the
black<00:04:27.900> liner<00:04:28.199> from<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.530> line<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.040> didn't<00:04:29.400> dry

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
black liner from this line it didn't dry

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
when I constantly found was that it was

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.070 
when I constantly found was that it was
a<00:05:23.280> gamble<00:05:23.880> whenever<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.330> opened<00:05:24.660> it<00:05:24.810> whether

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
a gamble whenever you opened it whether

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.230 
a gamble whenever you opened it whether
it<00:05:25.260> was<00:05:25.380> going<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.830> be<00:05:25.979> like<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:26.849> great

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
it was going to be like this great

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.390 
it was going to be like this great
fantastic<00:05:28.050> new<00:05:28.200> pencil<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.830> had<00:05:28.979> fluid

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
fantastic new pencil that had fluid

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.790 
fantastic new pencil that had fluid
flowing<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:30.120> like<00:05:30.360> crazy<00:05:30.780> or<00:05:31.080> whether<00:05:31.620> it's

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
flowing just like crazy or whether it's

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.529 
flowing just like crazy or whether it's
going<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.160> be<00:05:32.280> dry<00:05:32.610> as<00:05:32.669> a<00:05:32.760> bone<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.270> you

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
going to be dry as a bone and you

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.850 
going to be dry as a bone and you
basically<00:05:33.960> had<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.200> throw<00:05:34.380> it<00:05:34.440> away<00:05:34.530> there<00:05:34.770> was

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
basically had to throw it away there was

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.550 
basically had to throw it away there was
no<00:05:34.919> reviving<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.669> and<00:05:35.820> so<00:05:36.030> this<00:05:36.750> has<00:05:37.289> a<00:05:37.320> little

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
no reviving it and so this has a little

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.800 
no reviving it and so this has a little
bit<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.979> a<00:05:38.070> firmer<00:05:38.520> clasp<00:05:39.060> on<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.389> you<00:05:39.660> can

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
bit of a firmer clasp on it you can

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.960 
bit of a firmer clasp on it you can
actually<00:05:40.110> press<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.349> down<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:41.010> hear<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.669> click

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
actually press it down and hear it click

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.580 
actually press it down and hear it click
to<00:05:42.180> know<00:05:42.270> it's<00:05:42.419> completely<00:05:42.840> sealed<00:05:43.139> whereas

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
to know it's completely sealed whereas

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.990

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
essential eyeliners like I said that may

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.890 
essential eyeliners like I said that may
have<00:05:47.490> changed<00:05:47.789> with<00:05:48.090> new<00:05:48.240> packaging<00:05:48.690> let<00:05:48.840> me

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
know below if you tried them so that's

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.390 
know below if you tried them so that's
another<00:05:51.660> kind<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.139> pro<00:05:52.560> with<00:05:52.889> this<00:05:53.070> sort<00:05:53.340> of
