00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.590 
little bit you just want to use a bright
color<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.100> inner<00:03:11.130> corner<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.940> I'm<00:03:12.390> taking

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
color on the inner corner and I'm taking

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.759 
color on the inner corner and I'm taking
this<00:03:12.959> click<00:03:13.560> touch<00:03:14.070> base<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.900> eyes<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.709> it

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
this click touch base for eyes and it

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.920 
this click touch base for eyes and it

looks like this it's a really light
color<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:21.030> think<00:03:21.269> cream<00:03:21.480> shadows<00:03:21.810> work

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
color and I think cream shadows work

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.199 
color and I think cream shadows work
best<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.650> look<00:03:22.800> very<00:03:23.100> natural<00:03:23.489> it's

a little bit more dimension to the eye
but<00:03:38.370> I'm<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:38.910> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.360> for<00:03:39.630> now

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
but I'm not going to do that for now

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.720 
but I'm not going to do that for now
more<00:03:40.050> likely<00:03:40.290> than<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.680> your<00:03:41.370> eyeliner

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
more likely than not your eyeliner

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.250 
more likely than not your eyeliner
probably<00:03:42.300> has<00:03:42.420> faded<00:03:42.660> throughout<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.140> day

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
probably has faded throughout the day

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.160 
probably has faded throughout the day
and<00:03:43.410> probably<00:03:43.560> came<00:03:43.980> off<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.280> waterline<00:03:44.640> and

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
and probably came off your waterline and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.630 
and probably came off your waterline and
so<00:03:46.170> we<00:03:46.320> are<00:03:46.410> going<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.680> fix<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.920> by<00:03:47.190> adding<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
so we are going to fix that by adding a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.460 
so we are going to fix that by adding a
little<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:47.880> more

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.520 

and<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.970> can<00:03:55.120> take<00:03:55.270> any<00:03:55.390> other<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.990> want<00:03:56.260> but

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and you can take any other you want but

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.010 
and you can take any other you want but
i'm<00:03:56.620> using<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> graph<00:03:57.340> bach<00:03:57.610> technical<00:03:58.180> liner
