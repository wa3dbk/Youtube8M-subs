 yen go there during the workshop a little scared 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.080

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.560
 olive oil as we have marked our 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:27.090

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 other turn and know sucks everything 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.459
 gently then ours 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.370
 the leek will leave epicenter leather 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.720
 it'll soon boil I'll put my 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.650
 tite past coarse salt and in thirty 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.209
 seconds let's put our apples 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.660
 from land to water range so there you put 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.740
 a teen spoon of water and in shop 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.870
 Bernadette puts it to us and apples 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.870
 earth in the soup 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.550
 so 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.220
 m 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.810
 to the press so we can learn too 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.050
 Bernadette using a skimmer 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 today many people prefer 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.440
 that the cook quickly to touch 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.820
 goods directly clean hands 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.140
 we have clean hands it's true but 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.130
 it's a question because it's all 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.880
 simply a matter of hygiene 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.310
 it's the question of people's eyes 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.220
 So here we are going to cook 5 to 10 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.380
 minutes slowly our Julienne and 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.330

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.960
 wash the soup and cook we go mix 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.840
 and so we will use what 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.200
 kitchen utensil to mister a blender 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.200

 hand blender on the worktable 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.130
 what could we do laurent 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.430
 to be sure that the soup is not 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.990
