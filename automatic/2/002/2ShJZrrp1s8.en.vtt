locked reports which is in play mode the
message<00:00:23.699> will<00:00:23.850> play<00:00:24.000> when<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> doors<00:00:24.390> opened

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
message will play when the doors opened

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.589 
message will play when the doors opened
but<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.160> record<00:00:26.490> mode<00:00:26.580> it'll<00:00:27.420> start

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but when it's in record mode it'll start

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.509 
but when it's in record mode it'll start
recording<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.170> away<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> will<00:00:29.340> keep

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
recording right away and will keep

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.800 
recording right away and will keep
recording<00:00:29.970> until<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.359> throw<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> switch

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
recording until you throw the switch

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.319 
recording until you throw the switch
again<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.920> once<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.520> close<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> open<00:00:33.120> the

again then once you close and open the
door<00:00:33.360> it'll<00:00:33.899> play<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.140> message<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:35.250> how

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
door it'll play your message but how

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.620 
door it'll play your message but how
does<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> work<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.969> an<00:00:36.059> electronic<00:00:36.390> level

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
does this work on an electronic level

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
does this work on an electronic level
well<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.620> using<00:00:38.070> three<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> voice

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
well we're using three of the voice

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.330 
well we're using three of the voice
recording<00:00:39.329> chips<00:00:39.540> control<00:00:40.110> panels<00:00:40.410> I've

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
recording chips control panels I've

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.190 
recording chips control panels I've
pulled<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> schematic<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> can

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
pulled up the schematic here so you can

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
pulled up the schematic here so you can
see<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.640> playback<00:00:45.030> record

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
see it first we have the playback record

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
see it first we have the playback record
pin<00:00:45.570> once<00:00:46.379> connected<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> source<00:00:47.190> voltage

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
pin once connected to the source voltage

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
pin once connected to the source voltage
it's<00:00:48.480> also<00:00:48.629> called<00:00:48.870> high<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> chips<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.489> play

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's also called high the chips in play

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's also called high the chips in play
mode<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.110> connected<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> ground

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
mode when it's in connected to ground

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610 
mode when it's in connected to ground
it's<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.760> called<00:00:54.000> low<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> record

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it's also called low and it's in record

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's also called low and it's in record
mode<00:00:56.210> next<00:00:57.210> there's<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> PD<00:00:57.780> pin<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.410> acts

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
mode next there's the PD pin which acts

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
mode next there's the PD pin which acts
as<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> reset<00:00:59.190> pin<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.090> low<00:01:00.300> nothing

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
as the reset pin when it's low nothing

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
as the reset pin when it's low nothing
happens<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.620> high<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.910> chip

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
happens but when it's high the chip

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000 
happens but when it's high the chip
resets<00:01:03.510> playback<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.350> it'll<00:01:04.619> start<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
resets playback so it'll start the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.500 
resets playback so it'll start the
message<00:01:05.339> again<00:01:05.489> from<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> beginning<00:01:06.030> whether

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
message again from the beginning whether

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.789 
message again from the beginning whether
it's<00:01:07.350> recording<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:07.979> playing<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:09.930> C<00:01:10.290> n

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it's recording or playing and then C n

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.810 
it's recording or playing and then C n
is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> playpen<00:01:12.680> when<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.250> play<00:01:14.640> mode

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is the playpen when it's in play mode

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
is the playpen when it's in play mode
it'll<00:01:15.180> play<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> message<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.500> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it'll play the message but when it's in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
it'll play the message but when it's in
record<00:01:17.729> mode<00:01:17.759> it'll<00:01:18.360> start<00:01:18.630> recording<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.780> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
record mode it'll start recording so it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.109 
record mode it'll start recording so it
all<00:01:21.930> works<00:01:22.170> through<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.799> switches<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
all works through these two switches I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
all works through these two switches I
thought<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.470> thought<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
thought it really thought about how to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.440 
thought it really thought about how to
make<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> control<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:26.970> simple<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.299> possible

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
make the control as simple as possible

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.050 
make the control as simple as possible
this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.140> what<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> came<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.729> playback

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this is what I came up with the playback

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is what I came up with the playback
record<00:01:30.390> switch<00:01:30.570> controls<00:01:31.049> both<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.560> playback

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
record switch controls both the playback

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.969 
record switch controls both the playback
record<00:01:32.220> pin<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.380> one<00:01:34.380> side<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> door

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
record pin and one side of the door

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.170 
record pin and one side of the door
switch<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> does<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.189> record

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
switch so what this does is in record

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
switch so what this does is in record
mode<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.689> playback<00:01:39.990> reports<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.710> low

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
mode the playback reports which is low

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
mode the playback reports which is low
it<00:01:41.670> forces<00:01:42.270> both<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.290> pins<00:01:43.560> well

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it forces both of these two pins well

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.450 
it forces both of these two pins well
because<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> door<00:01:45.119> switch<00:01:45.360> acts<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.259> low<00:01:47.100> or

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
because the door switch acts as low or

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.819 
because the door switch acts as low or
whatever<00:01:48.390> playback<00:01:48.750> record<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.409> playback

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
whatever playback record is if playback

reward is low these two pins are low no

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.340 
reward is low these two pins are low no
matter<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.630> when<00:01:54.630> playback<00:01:54.960> record<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

matter what so when playback record is
low<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.649> three<00:01:56.040> orlov<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.880> puts<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> chip

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
low all three orlov this puts the chip

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
low all three orlov this puts the chip
in<00:01:57.840> record<00:01:58.170> mode<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.740> doesn't<00:01:59.040> reset<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.579> it

in record mode it doesn't reset and it
starts<00:02:00.630> recording<00:02:01.520> once<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> flip<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> back

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
starts recording once you flip it back

starts recording once you flip it back
the<00:02:03.780> recording<00:02:03.899> stops<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.560> away<00:02:04.740> that's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the recording stops right away that's

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.679 
the recording stops right away that's
what<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> check<00:02:05.759> does<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> door<00:02:06.509> switch

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
what the check does so the door switch

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.070 
what the check does so the door switch
starts<00:02:06.960> working<00:02:07.229> again<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.590> high<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.310> low

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
starts working again it's high or low

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.270 
starts working again it's high or low
and<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.860> when<00:02:10.700> P<00:02:11.270> D<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.540> C<00:02:11.690> E<00:02:11.720> pins<00:02:12.050> are<00:02:12.350> low<00:02:12.920> or

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and so when P D and C E pins are low or

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.330 
and so when P D and C E pins are low or
when<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.300> door<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.510> open<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.650> starts<00:02:16.070> playing

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
when the door is open it starts playing

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.020 
when the door is open it starts playing
then<00:02:16.940> when<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.240> closed<00:02:17.570> or<00:02:17.930> high<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:19.100> reset

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
then when it's closed or high they reset

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.520 
then when it's closed or high they reset
the<00:02:20.060> message<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.960> that's<00:02:21.170> how<00:02:21.320> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the message and so that's how the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.630 
the message and so that's how the
control<00:02:22.280> works<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.240> door<00:02:23.420> alarm
