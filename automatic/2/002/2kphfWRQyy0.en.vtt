little bit more sweet foam which is the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.949 
little bit more sweet foam which is the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
lot so is this considered a dry or wet

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.760 
lot so is this considered a dry or wet
that<00:02:04.450> would<00:02:04.569> be<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.720> wet<00:02:04.959> cappuccino<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> great

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
above Center a dry cappuccino would be

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.210 
above Center a dry cappuccino would be
much<00:02:10.330> closer<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.959> maybe<00:02:11.260> an<00:02:11.410> inch<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.739> milk<00:02:11.980> and

beverages where we put the shot in and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.320 
beverages where we put the shot in and
then<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.599> added<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> milk<00:02:35.349> either<00:02:36.190> by<00:02:36.430> pouring

then we added the milk either by pouring

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.240 
then we added the milk either by pouring
it<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.050> would<00:02:38.200> do<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.860> macchiato

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
it in what we would do is in a macchiato

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.949 
it in what we would do is in a macchiato
we<00:02:39.610> would<00:02:39.819> just<00:02:40.090> put<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.390> milk<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.870> then

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
we would mark the top with the espresso

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.410 
we would mark the top with the espresso
on<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.530> foam<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> espresso<00:02:46.180> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
on the foam so that the espresso and

beverage with caramel okay with that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840 
beverage with caramel okay with that
cross-hatching<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.590> caramel<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.790> you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
cross-hatching of caramel so what do you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.950 
cross-hatching of caramel so what do you
think<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> cappuccino<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
think of the cappuccino you know it

think of the cappuccino you know it
looks<00:03:01.140> beautiful<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.710> think<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> true

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
looks beautiful but I think the true

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.920 
looks beautiful but I think the true
test<00:03:02.550> of<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.850> cappuccino<00:03:03.360> would<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
test of a cappuccino would be in the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.120 
test of a cappuccino would be in the
taste<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.320> why<00:03:04.440> don't<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.620> give<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.950> taste

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
taste so why don't you give it a taste

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130 
taste so why don't you give it a taste
I'm<00:03:06.090> gonna<00:03:06.240> have<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.600> bit<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.960> latte

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
