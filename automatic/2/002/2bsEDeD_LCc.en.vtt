silver tokens from Metroid Prime

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.189 
silver tokens from Metroid Prime
otherwise<00:00:24.420> you're<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.720> gonna<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:25.080> like

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
otherwise you're just gonna be like

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.599 
otherwise you're just gonna be like
halfway<00:00:25.500> done<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.010> won't<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.250> able<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> get

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
halfway done you won't be able to get

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
halfway done you won't be able to get
everything<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.330> think<00:00:27.480> that's<00:00:27.900> how<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
everything I think that's how it is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.220 
everything I think that's how it is
maybe<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.070> different<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.050> go

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
maybe it's a different but I'm gonna go

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.380 
maybe it's a different but I'm gonna go
through<00:00:31.410> hyper<00:00:31.560> mode<00:00:31.800> anyway<00:00:32.090> now<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> thing

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
through hyper mode anyway now the thing

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380 
through hyper mode anyway now the thing
is<00:00:33.710> because<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> New<00:00:35.430> Game+<00:00:35.790> function

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is because this is a New Game+ function

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
is because this is a New Game+ function
your<00:00:36.570> scans<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.350> carry<00:00:37.710> over<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> only

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
your scans do carry over so you only

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.560 
your scans do carry over so you only
have<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> scan<00:00:39.300> everything<00:00:39.899> once

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
have to scan everything once

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
have to scan everything once
so<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.860> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.610> awesome<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:50.930> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so that's just kind of awesome and that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.619 
so that's just kind of awesome and that
doesn't<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> pickups<00:00:53.399> though

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
doesn't go for the pickups though

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.819 
doesn't go for the pickups though
fortunately<00:00:54.629> that'd<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> cheap<00:00:55.590> too

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
fortunately that'd be kind of cheap too

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.549 
fortunately that'd be kind of cheap too
did

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559

I'm thinking about just letting this
credit<00:02:05.610> sequence<00:02:05.970> go<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.210> I<00:02:09.450> don't

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
credit sequence go but and I don't

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.609 
credit sequence go but and I don't
really<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:09.990> whole<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.350> talk<00:02:10.470> about

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
really have a whole lot to talk about

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.530 
really have a whole lot to talk about
there<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.610> some<00:02:11.910> stuff<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.390> I've<00:02:12.510> been

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
there is some stuff that I've been
