hit<00:01:39.550> by<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:39.790> then<00:01:40.300> you're<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.840> dying<00:01:41.200> mood

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500

straight<00:01:41.920> away<00:01:42.160> I<00:01:42.400> think<00:01:43.230> naafi<00:01:44.230> swings<00:01:44.530> are

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
straight away I think naafi swings are

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.730 
straight away I think naafi swings are
very<00:01:44.860> few<00:01:44.950> late<00:01:45.160> does<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.030> overhead<00:01:46.740> that's

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
very few late does it overhead that's

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.200 
very few late does it overhead that's
easier<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.040> dodge<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> want<00:01:49.120> to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
easier to dodge just going to want to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.390 
easier to dodge just going to want to
really<00:01:49.510> try<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.960> take<00:01:50.200> him<00:01:50.410> out<00:01:50.560> by<00:01:50.890> shooting

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
really try to take him out by shooting

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.940 
really try to take him out by shooting
until<00:01:51.580> he<00:01:51.910> kneels<00:01:52.450> down<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:52.990> then<00:01:53.110> keep

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
until he kneels down and then keep

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.320 
until he kneels down and then keep
packing<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.580> punch<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.150> chops<00:01:57.330> either
