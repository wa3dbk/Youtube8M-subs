00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
ready they filled up this block and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.980 
ready they filled up this block and
they're<00:02:21.360> ready<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.690> put<00:02:22.590> into<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:24.000> bigger<00:02:24.690> pot

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
they're ready to put into a bigger pot

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.580 
they're ready to put into a bigger pot
now<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.160> gently<00:02:26.880> break<00:02:27.840> off<00:02:28.050> those<00:02:28.320> little

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
now so gently break off those little

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.640 
now so gently break off those little
relieves<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.340> again<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.350> tell

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
relieves and again you can kind of tell

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.670 
relieves and again you can kind of tell
which<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.280> plant<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:32.790> bend<00:02:33.440> gently<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
which way the plant will bend gently and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.500 
which way the plant will bend gently and
you<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.340> bend<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> roots<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> lay<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
you can bend the roots you can lay the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.250 
you can bend the roots you can lay the
ritz<00:02:36.720> flat<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:42.450> doesn't<00:02:42.810> matter<00:02:42.990> either

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
ritz flat and it doesn't matter either

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.650 
ritz flat and it doesn't matter either
if<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.830> plant<00:02:44.160> isn't<00:02:44.580> right<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.390> middle

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
if the plant isn't right in the middle

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.199 
if the plant isn't right in the middle
of<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> pot<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.700> looks<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.030> lot<00:02:48.150> nicer

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
of the pot I know it looks a lot nicer

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.990 
of the pot I know it looks a lot nicer
but<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.920> ends<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.370> little<00:02:50.610> bit<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but if it ends up a little bit on the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.510 
but if it ends up a little bit on the
side<00:02:51.239> that's<00:02:51.480> okay<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.770> better<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.370> it

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
side that's okay it's better to get it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.060 
side that's okay it's better to get it
in<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> pot<00:02:54.150> deeply<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:55.920> get<00:02:56.040> a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
in the pot deeply so that you can get a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.150 
in the pot deeply so that you can get a
lot<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.310> writs<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.470> stem<00:02:58.470> under<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.920> soil

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
lot of writs on that stem under the soil

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.840 
lot of writs on that stem under the soil
give<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> little<00:03:03.380> pat<00:03:05.209> label<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
give a little pat label it with the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.140 
give a little pat label it with the
others<00:03:11.630> just<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.959> soil<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> bottom

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.449 

and<00:03:18.150> press<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.590> now<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.160> one's<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
and press up on that now this one's a

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.030 
and press up on that now this one's a
little<00:03:20.610> bit<00:03:20.880> drier<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:22.530> one<00:03:22.799> thing

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
little bit drier and that's one thing

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.070 
little bit drier and that's one thing
when<00:03:23.310> when<00:03:23.670> they<00:03:23.820> start<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.299> get<00:03:24.510> rip<00:03:24.810> bound

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
when when they start to get rip bound

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.190 
when when they start to get rip bound
even<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.190> water<00:03:26.750> sometimes<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.930> water

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
even if you water sometimes that water

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.620 
even if you water sometimes that water
can't<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.799> down<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> bottom<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.120> that's

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
can't get down to the bottom so that's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.449 
can't get down to the bottom so that's
another<00:03:30.989> signal<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:32.100> is<00:03:32.250> definitely

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
another signal that this is definitely

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.460 
another signal that this is definitely
time<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> transplant<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> break<00:03:36.510> up<00:03:36.720> off<00:03:37.200> those

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
time to transplant so break up off those

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.140 
time to transplant so break up off those
lower<00:03:37.709> leaves<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:40.670> gently<00:03:41.670> put<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
lower leaves and then gently put the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.060 
lower leaves and then gently put the
plant<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.920> pot<00:03:45.260> hold<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.410> little<00:03:46.709> bit<00:03:46.890> while

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
plant in the pot hold a little bit while

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.460 
plant in the pot hold a little bit while
we<00:03:47.100> put<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.670> soil<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> good

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
we put that soil in so it's in a good

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.569 
we put that soil in so it's in a good
position<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.860> grow<00:03:56.100> mix<00:03:56.340> from

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
position and this is the grow mix from

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.690 
position and this is the grow mix from
Johnny's<00:03:57.320> sometimes<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.470> mix<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:59.160> just

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
Johnny's sometimes I mix it with just

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.020 
Johnny's sometimes I mix it with just
your<00:03:59.940> regular<00:04:01.970> potting<00:04:02.970> soil<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
your regular potting soil and just the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.420 
your regular potting soil and just the
potting<00:04:06.360> soil<00:04:06.630> alone<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.140> fine<00:04:07.380> too<00:04:07.709> i<00:04:08.010> have

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
potting soil alone is fine too i have

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.300 
potting soil alone is fine too i have
not<00:04:08.760> had<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:09.320> fertilize<00:04:10.320> any<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.680> these<00:04:10.769> plants

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
not had to fertilize any of these plants

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.009 
not had to fertilize any of these plants
because<00:04:11.670> I'm<00:04:11.820> transplanting<00:04:12.360> them<00:04:12.690> soon

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
because I'm transplanting them soon

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.690 
because I'm transplanting them soon
enough<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.530> they<00:04:13.769> still<00:04:14.250> are<00:04:14.370> getting<00:04:14.610> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
enough that they still are getting the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.580 
enough that they still are getting the
nutrients<00:04:15.209> out<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.690> soil<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.440> I'm

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
nutrients out of the soil that I'm

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.069 
nutrients out of the soil that I'm
putting<00:04:16.799> them<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:19.130> so

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
putting them in and so

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.460 
putting them in and so
then<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.069> just<00:04:22.310> gently<00:04:22.639> water<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:26.470> plants

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
then you just gently water and plants

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.969 
then you just gently water and plants
will<00:04:28.069> be<00:04:28.220> ready<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.729> put<00:04:28.970> in<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.360> ground<00:04:29.979> well

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
will be ready to put in the ground well

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.360 
will be ready to put in the ground well
two<00:04:31.580> weeks<00:04:31.879> to<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> month<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.800> probably<00:04:34.189> what

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
two weeks to a month is probably what

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.629 
two weeks to a month is probably what
we'll<00:04:34.520> leave<00:04:34.729> these<00:04:35.000> in<00:04:35.530> here<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.710> should

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
we'll leave these in here I should

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.050 
we'll leave these in here I should
suggest<00:04:37.879> also<00:04:38.479> that<00:04:38.719> I<00:04:39.400> have<00:04:40.400> my<00:04:40.610> grow<00:04:40.819> lights

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
suggest also that I have my grow lights

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360 
suggest also that I have my grow lights
on<00:04:41.270> for<00:04:41.569> 24<00:04:42.020> hours<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.439> I<00:04:42.680> keep<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.009> plants

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
on for 24 hours and I keep the plants

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.450 
on for 24 hours and I keep the plants
under<00:04:44.030> for<00:04:44.449> that<00:04:44.569> amount<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.960> time<00:04:45.460> some

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
under for that amount of time some

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.600 
under for that amount of time some
suggest<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.389> you<00:04:47.569> only<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.469> for<00:04:48.500> 12<00:04:49.069> to<00:04:49.219> 14

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
suggest that you only do it for 12 to 14

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.179 
suggest that you only do it for 12 to 14
hours<00:04:49.759> keep<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.419> light<00:04:50.780> on<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:51.289> have<00:04:51.800> not<00:04:51.979> found
