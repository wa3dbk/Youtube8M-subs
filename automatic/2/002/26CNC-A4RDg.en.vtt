as<00:01:14.189> far<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:16.759> forward<00:01:17.759> backward<00:01:18.090> looks<00:01:18.600> like

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
as far as a forward backward looks like

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
as far as a forward backward looks like
there<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.320> lines<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.009> inwards<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.000> I'm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
there are lines that inwards on I'm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
there are lines that inwards on I'm
going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> assume<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.900> us<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> forward

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
going to assume with us the forward

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
going to assume with us the forward
position<00:01:25.490> ok<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.940> logged<00:01:27.149> in<00:01:27.740> okay<00:01:28.740> cool

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
position ok it was logged in okay cool

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.180 
position ok it was logged in okay cool
so<00:01:29.100> let's<00:01:29.750> locked<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.899> finger<00:01:31.229> tightening<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
so let's locked in finger tightening I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.430 
so let's locked in finger tightening I
want<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> take<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.330> 15<00:01:33.690> millimeter<00:01:33.899> wrench<00:01:34.320> on

been you know so you can straighten it
out<00:01:56.210> slowly<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.569> doesn't<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.080> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
out slowly so it doesn't get out of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.609 
out slowly so it doesn't get out of
whack<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.860> tightening<00:01:59.039> it<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> it's

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
next up is pedal assembly so the total

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.170 
next up is pedal assembly so the total
packet<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:58.980> had<00:02:59.130> earlier<00:02:59.489> just<00:02:59.700> grab<00:02:59.880> that

right one dozen left obviously since the
left<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.500> here<00:03:21.680> we're<00:03:21.830> going<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> start<00:03:22.069> our

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
left is here we're going to start our

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.860 
left is here we're going to start our
left<00:03:23.739> let's<00:03:24.739> do<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.099> left<00:03:25.280> pedal<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.660> left

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
left let's do the left pedal the left

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.600 
left let's do the left pedal the left
side<00:03:27.110> pedal<00:03:27.349> does<00:03:27.650> not<00:03:27.800> go<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.069> clockwise<00:03:28.190> it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
side pedal does not go in a clockwise it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.150 
side pedal does not go in a clockwise it
goes<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.849> counterclockwise<00:03:29.920> it's<00:03:30.920> always<00:03:31.099> a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
goes in counterclockwise it's always a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.259 
goes in counterclockwise it's always a
good<00:03:31.250> idea<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.550> have<00:03:31.730> some<00:03:31.849> grease<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:32.510> good<00:03:33.170> so

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.229 

just<00:03:38.269> put<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.290> into<00:03:39.470> place<00:03:39.709> use<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.580> left

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
hand turn it counterclockwise kind of

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.210 
hand turn it counterclockwise kind of
feel<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.040> catch<00:03:46.630> if<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.750> feel<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.080> hold<00:03:48.410> don't

feel it catch if you feel it hold don't

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.340 
feel it catch if you feel it hold don't
go<00:03:49.340> any<00:03:49.489> further<00:03:49.519> let's<00:03:50.510> wait<00:03:50.690> for<00:03:50.959> it

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
go any further let's wait for it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.809 
go any further let's wait for it
catch<00:03:51.890> on<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:54.250> alright<00:03:55.250> now<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.549> it's

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
catch on there alright now that it's

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.680 
catch on there alright now that it's
caught<00:03:56.060> we<00:03:56.299> can<00:03:56.450> feel<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:58.269> turn<00:03:59.269> it<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.510> rest

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
caught we can feel it turn it the rest
