shots like they're relying on getting to
the<00:01:10.070> free-throw<00:01:10.310> line<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.330> we<00:01:11.630> sort<00:01:12.020> of

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
the free-throw line but we sort of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.630 
the free-throw line but we sort of
ignored<00:01:12.439> in<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.650> process<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.400> he<00:01:13.549> is

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
ignored in the process is that he is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.910 
ignored in the process is that he is
having<00:01:13.820> his<00:01:14.090> best<00:01:14.330> playoffs<00:01:14.810> ever<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.740> terms

Smith the bigs have been playing very

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.840 
Smith the bigs have been playing very
very<00:01:59.840> well<00:02:00.260> so<00:02:00.530> an<00:02:00.710> admirable<00:02:01.280> effort<00:02:01.490> with

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
very well so an admirable effort with

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.060 
very well so an admirable effort with
not<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.090> ton<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.690> top-level<00:02:03.229> town<00:02:03.500> around<00:02:03.890> him

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
not a ton of top-level town around him

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.250 
not a ton of top-level town around him
my<00:02:04.729> big<00:02:04.880> story<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.210> Steph<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.780> whether<00:02:06.080> or<00:02:06.200> not

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
my big story is Steph and whether or not

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.380 
my big story is Steph and whether or not
it<00:02:06.560> will<00:02:06.740> matter<00:02:07.070> if<00:02:07.310> he's<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> big<00:02:07.790> store<00:02:08.119> yeah

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
it will matter if he's a big store yeah

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.660 
it will matter if he's a big store yeah
because<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:09.019> good<00:02:09.379> as<00:02:09.619> he<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.159> and<00:02:10.429> he<00:02:10.489> might

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
because as good as he is and he might

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.250 
because as good as he is and he might
have<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> really<00:02:11.150> favorable<00:02:11.629> matchup<00:02:12.019> if<00:02:12.140> he's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
have a really favorable matchup if he's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.990 
have a really favorable matchup if he's
paired<00:02:12.500> against<00:02:12.799> Kyrie<00:02:12.980> for<00:02:13.549> majority<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
paired against Kyrie for majority of the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.789 
paired against Kyrie for majority of the
time<00:02:14.150> who<00:02:14.330> still<00:02:14.780> appears<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.319> be<00:02:15.440> very

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
time who still appears to be very

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.520 
time who still appears to be very
dominant<00:02:16.549> yeah<00:02:16.849> even<00:02:17.810> though<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> think<00:02:18.379> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
dominant yeah even though I think the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.050 
dominant yeah even though I think the
series<00:02:18.860> runs<00:02:19.190> through<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.670> bigs

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
series runs through the bigs

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.570 
series runs through the bigs
if<00:02:20.180> Steph<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.989> give<00:02:21.260> them<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:22.010> efficiency

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
if Steph can give them the efficiency

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.250 
if Steph can give them the efficiency
that<00:02:22.610> he's<00:02:22.909> shown<00:02:23.150> at<00:02:23.420> times<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.019> playoffs

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
that he's shown at times in the playoffs

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.320 
that he's shown at times in the playoffs
it<00:02:24.709> gives<00:02:25.190> them<00:02:25.400> an<00:02:25.489> element<00:02:25.909> I<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.150> don't

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it gives them an element I just don't

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.229 
it gives them an element I just don't
think<00:02:26.480> even<00:02:27.409> if<00:02:27.500> he<00:02:27.620> has<00:02:27.769> he<00:02:28.069> goes<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.340> for<00:02:28.489> 33<00:02:29.060> I

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
think even if he has he goes on for 33 I

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.640 
think even if he has he goes on for 33 I
don't<00:02:29.750> think<00:02:29.900> that's<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.140> be-all<00:02:30.500> end-all

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
don't think that's the be-all end-all

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.170 
don't think that's the be-all end-all
which<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.069> really<00:02:31.250> interesting<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:31.670> he

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
which is really interesting because he

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.820 
which is really interesting because he
might<00:02:32.390> still<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> best<00:02:33.319> player<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
might still be the best player in the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.910 
might still be the best player in the
NBA<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:35.480> curious<00:02:36.079> to<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.379> that<00:02:36.709> matchup

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
NBA so I'm curious to see that matchup

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.679 
NBA so I'm curious to see that matchup
what<00:02:37.249> is<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:37.519> is<00:02:37.609> your<00:02:37.700> little<00:02:37.909> story<00:02:38.299> okay

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
what is what is your little story okay

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.970 
what is what is your little story okay
we<00:02:39.079> haven't<00:02:39.379> really<00:02:39.469> focused

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
we haven't really focused

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.800 
we haven't really focused
the<00:02:40.040> coaches<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.700> either<00:02:41.000> girls<00:02:41.360> teams<00:02:41.599> in<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
the coaches of either girls teams in the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
the coaches of either girls teams in the
playoffs<00:02:41.900> largely<00:02:42.500> because<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:42.769> haven't<00:02:43.159> had

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
playoffs largely because we haven't had

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.430 
playoffs largely because we haven't had
to<00:02:43.550> grind<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.060> players<00:02:44.299> on<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.629> court<00:02:44.659> but

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
to grind the players on the court but

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.259 
to grind the players on the court but
we're<00:02:45.650> gonna<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> rookie<00:02:46.370> head<00:02:46.549> coach<00:02:46.610> win

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
we're gonna have a rookie head coach win

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.820 
we're gonna have a rookie head coach win
the<00:02:47.420> NBA<00:02:47.540> title<00:02:48.049> for<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.290> first<00:02:48.470> time<00:02:48.680> since

1982<00:02:49.549> mm-hmm<00:02:50.180> that's<00:02:50.450> before<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.379> were

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
1982 mm-hmm that's before you and I were

1982 mm-hmm that's before you and I were
born<00:02:51.739> this<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.129> true<00:02:52.459> but<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.790> are<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:52.909> lot<00:02:53.750> of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
born this is true but we are a lot of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.000 
born this is true but we are a lot of
things<00:02:54.049> happen<00:02:54.319> before<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:54.709> were<00:02:54.799> born

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
things happen before we were born

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.270 
things happen before we were born
because<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.370> are<00:02:55.459> impossibly<00:02:56.030> young<00:02:56.120> yes<00:02:57.280> but

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
because we are impossibly young yes but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890 
because we are impossibly young yes but
you<00:02:58.489> know<00:02:58.610> neither<00:02:59.000> one<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.239> these<00:02:59.390> coaches

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you know neither one of these coaches

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.420 
you know neither one of these coaches
has<00:03:00.080> had<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.440> deal<00:03:00.590> with<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.769> team<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.220> lost

has had to deal with a team that lost

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.550 
has had to deal with a team that lost
Game<00:03:01.730> one<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.150> plant<00:03:02.390> right<00:03:02.660> neither<00:03:03.290> one

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
Game one of a plant right neither one

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.530 
Game one of a plant right neither one
has<00:03:03.799> had<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.069> deal<00:03:04.280> with<00:03:04.519> really<00:03:04.819> being<00:03:05.269> down

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
has had to deal with really being down

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.360 
has had to deal with really being down
much<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.019> playoff<00:03:06.200> series<00:03:06.470> warriors<00:03:07.129> fell

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
much in a playoff series warriors fell

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
much in a playoff series warriors fell
behind<00:03:07.579> against<00:03:08.000> Memphis<00:03:08.269> after<00:03:08.690> every<00:03:08.930> games

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
behind against Memphis after every games

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.970 
behind against Memphis after every games
that's<00:03:09.560> it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
that's it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.890 
that's it
they've<00:03:10.549> never<00:03:10.760> faced<00:03:11.060> an<00:03:11.239> elimination<00:03:11.870> game

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
they've never faced an elimination game

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.990 
they've never faced an elimination game
true<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.129> think<00:03:13.220> there<00:03:13.549> are<00:03:13.579> some<00:03:13.790> questions

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
true so I think there are some questions

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.330 
true so I think there are some questions
about<00:03:14.390> how<00:03:15.260> are<00:03:15.440> these<00:03:15.530> coaches<00:03:16.010> going<00:03:16.160> to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
about how are these coaches going to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.490 
about how are these coaches going to
react<00:03:16.640> when<00:03:16.910> inevitably<00:03:17.269> one<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.230> them<00:03:18.349> is

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
react when inevitably one of them is

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.990

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
the Warriors can keep that up and

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.730 
the Warriors can keep that up and
