00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100 
vent you'll see that there's a good
distance<00:01:29.850> between<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> button<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
distance between it and the button that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.080 
distance between it and the button that
opens<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.500> helmet<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.369> again<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.880> you're

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
opens the helmet so again there you're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.429 
opens the helmet so again there you're
not<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.540> confused<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.380> to

and<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.970> two-stage<00:01:39.479> there's<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and it's two-stage there's one and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
and it's two-stage there's one and
there's<00:01:40.829> two<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.119> easy<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> operate

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
there's two so really easy to operate

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.679 
there's two so really easy to operate
easy<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.680> remember<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> top

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
easy to remember when you get to the top

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
easy to remember when you get to the top
vent<00:01:46.049> again<00:01:46.560> easy<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> find<00:01:47.310> even<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
vent again easy to find even with a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130 
vent again easy to find even with a
gloved<00:01:47.970> hand<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.509> operates<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:48.990> much

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gloved hand and it operates pretty much

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
gloved hand and it operates pretty much
like<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> ballpoint<00:01:49.799> pen<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.670> triangular

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
like a ballpoint pen it's triangular

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
like a ballpoint pen it's triangular
shape<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:51.780> easy<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> find<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> back<00:01:52.500> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shape so it's easy to find the back of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
shape so it's easy to find the back of
it<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.890> reach<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.280> back<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.759> push

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it you reach to the back you just push

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.230 
it you reach to the back you just push
down<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.470> times<00:01:55.799> four<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> two-stage

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
down one two times four it's a two-stage

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
down one two times four it's a two-stage
mechanism<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.590> lever<00:01:58.829> here

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
mechanism and this little lever here

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.030 
mechanism and this little lever here
goes<00:01:59.369> straight<00:01:59.820> back<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.659> close<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> that's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
goes straight back to close it that's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.969 
goes straight back to close it that's
how<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.520> close<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> top<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.500> shield<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
how you close the top down the shield is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.570 
how you close the top down the shield is
spring-loaded<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:06.799> pulls<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.340> give<00:02:08.489> you

here<00:02:37.660> what<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.290> does<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.160> operates<00:02:39.610> our

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
here what that does is it operates our

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.500 
here what that does is it operates our
drop-down<00:02:40.360> full<00:02:41.079> Eclipse<00:02:41.349> Sun<00:02:41.890> shield<00:02:42.390> one<00:02:43.390> of

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
drop-down full Eclipse Sun shield one of

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.640 
drop-down full Eclipse Sun shield one of
the<00:02:43.599> things<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:43.900> nice<00:02:44.079> about<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.409> is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
the things that's nice about that is

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.440 
the things that's nice about that is
that<00:02:44.680> spring-loaded<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.700> it'll<00:02:46.090> trigger<00:02:46.299> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
that spring-loaded so it'll trigger and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.059 
that spring-loaded so it'll trigger and
get<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> way<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.140> fast<00:02:47.379> if<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
get out of the way really fast if the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.500 
get out of the way really fast if the
conditions<00:02:48.519> change<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.120> need<00:02:49.269> more

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
conditions change and you need more

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.869 
conditions change and you need more
light<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:50.440> removable<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.370> can<00:02:51.519> replace<00:02:51.819> it

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
light it's removable you can replace it

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.210 
light it's removable you can replace it
with<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.150> light<00:02:52.840> tint<00:02:53.140> or<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.440> highlighter<00:02:53.890> lens

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
with a light tint or a highlighter lens

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.819 
with a light tint or a highlighter lens
and<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:55.359> think<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.170> one<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.620> best

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
and I think this is one of the best

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.559 
and I think this is one of the best
values<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.430> market<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:57.910> invite<00:02:58.150> people<00:02:58.359> to

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
values on the market I invite people to

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.509 
values on the market I invite people to
compare<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.109> others<00:02:59.379> for<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.950> money<00:03:00.129> spent

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
compare it to others for the money spent

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.710 
compare it to others for the money spent
I<00:03:00.700> don't<00:03:00.849> think<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.299> find<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.599> better

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I don't think you can find a better

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.220 
I don't think you can find a better
modular<00:03:02.260> than<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> ff3<00:03:02.890> 86<00:03:03.489> yeah<00:03:03.970> or<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.959> fit
