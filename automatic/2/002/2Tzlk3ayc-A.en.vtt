00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
so here we are here in the GTN labs also

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.560 
so here we are here in the GTN labs also
known<00:00:22.359> as<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.689> kitchen<00:00:23.140> mmm<00:00:24.329> that's<00:00:25.329> good<00:00:25.359> we

can<00:00:25.689> eat<00:00:25.900> in<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.169> lab<00:00:26.349> yeah<00:00:26.769> that's<00:00:27.189> true<00:00:27.340> that

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
can eat in the lab yeah that's true that

we're drinking out of beakers and
erlenmeyer<00:00:30.099> flasks<00:00:30.699> right<00:00:31.029> we<00:00:31.269> won't<00:00:31.359> talk

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
erlenmeyer flasks right we won't talk

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.579 
erlenmeyer flasks right we won't talk
about<00:00:31.840> the<00:00:31.929> rest<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.259> it<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:34.809> did<00:00:35.019> frequency

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
about the rest of it we did frequency

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.160 
about the rest of it we did frequency
sweeps<00:00:35.860> on<00:00:36.100> 10<00:00:36.400> cables<00:00:36.879> and<00:00:37.120> then<00:00:37.809> we<00:00:37.989> actually

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
sweeps on 10 cables and then we actually

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.090 
sweeps on 10 cables and then we actually
played<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.800> little<00:00:39.250> blues<00:00:39.610> riff<00:00:40.000> on<00:00:40.949> seven<00:00:41.949> of

evidence audio a cable that came with a

nickel-plated what I would call a junkie
cable<00:01:08.039> we<00:01:09.039> also<00:01:09.220> had<00:01:09.610> an<00:01:09.789> analysis<00:01:10.450> plus

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
cable we also had an analysis plus

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.560 
cable we also had an analysis plus
purple<00:01:11.110> cable<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.490> something<00:01:13.420> that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
purple cable and that is something that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.540 
purple cable and that is something that
they<00:01:13.929> don't<00:01:14.170> make<00:01:14.409> unless<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:14.950> custom<00:01:15.310> order

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
they don't make unless you custom order

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.180 
they don't make unless you custom order
anymore<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.210> then<00:01:16.899> we<00:01:17.080> had<00:01:17.800> our<00:01:17.979> rubber

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
anymore and then we had our rubber

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.450 
anymore and then we had our rubber
chicken<00:01:18.610> cable<00:01:19.030> which<00:01:19.210> was<00:01:19.509> an<00:01:19.869> RCA<00:01:20.800> cable

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
chicken cable which was an RCA cable

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.830 
chicken cable which was an RCA cable
with<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.390> quarter<00:01:22.780> inch<00:01:22.990> adapter

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.310 

so<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:28.070> cable<00:01:28.580> tests<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.270> shoot<00:01:29.810> out<00:01:29.960> of

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so the cable tests that shoot out of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.230 
so the cable tests that shoot out of
shootouts<00:01:30.950> our<00:01:31.190> first<00:01:31.600> real<00:01:32.600> shootout<00:01:33.170> and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
shootouts our first real shootout and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.810 
shootouts our first real shootout and
results<00:01:35.240> were<00:01:35.450> surprising<00:01:36.550> yeah<00:01:37.550> they<00:01:37.760> were

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
results were surprising yeah they were

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.310 
results were surprising yeah they were
and<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:38.420> thought<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.660> was<00:01:38.810> going<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.990> be<00:01:39.110> one<00:01:39.290> of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and we thought it was going to be one of

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.730 
and we thought it was going to be one of
the<00:01:39.470> easy<00:01:39.619> ones<00:01:40.659> little<00:01:41.659> did<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.810> know<00:01:41.960> how

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
the easy ones little did we know how

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.050 
the easy ones little did we know how
much<00:01:42.920> detail<00:01:43.310> we<00:01:43.400> were<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.670> have<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.940> get

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
much detail we were going to have to get

00:01:44.060 --> 00:02:03.080 
much detail we were going to have to get
into

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.149
