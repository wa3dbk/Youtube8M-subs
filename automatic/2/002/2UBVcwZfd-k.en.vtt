00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.660 

well<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.590> important<00:02:40.950> thing<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> didn't<00:02:41.519> see

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
well the important thing is I didn't see

really<00:02:45.660> feel<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.870> need<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.230> film<00:02:46.769> pig<00:02:47.040> poop

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
really feel the need to film pig poop

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.759 
really feel the need to film pig poop
and<00:02:47.940> then<00:02:48.150> okay<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.959> thing<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.560> is

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and then okay the thing I think is

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.170 
and then okay the thing I think is
important<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> got<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.730> guys<00:02:50.880> see

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
important is that you got you guys see

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.729 
important is that you got you guys see
the<00:02:51.299> wood<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.170> next<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> wood

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
the wood and then next to the wood

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.129 
the wood and then next to the wood
there's<00:02:52.980> these<00:02:53.190> rocks<00:02:53.459> yeah<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.690> holds<00:02:55.049> up

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
there's these rocks yeah this holds up

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.670 
there's these rocks yeah this holds up
this<00:02:55.489> cuz<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.549> kind<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.790> had<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.410> mean<00:02:58.440> dig<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
this cuz we kind of had to mean dig a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.210 
this cuz we kind of had to mean dig a
hole<00:02:58.769> into<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.400> hill<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.569> mound<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
hole into this hill and this mound and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.650 
hole into this hill and this mound and
then<00:03:02.459> yeah<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.030> rocks

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
then yeah the rocks

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960 
then yeah the rocks
I<00:03:03.690> think<00:03:04.560> act<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:04.889> nice<00:03:05.100> thermal<00:03:05.519> mass<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
I think act is a nice thermal mass as a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
I think act is a nice thermal mass as a
south<00:03:06.410> fish<00:03:08.000> okay<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.060> when<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.019> use<00:03:10.290> both

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
south fish okay you when you use both

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.559 
south fish okay you when you use both
hands<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.980> signify<00:03:11.340> South<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.970> gets<00:03:12.150> harder<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
hands to signify South it gets harder to

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.860 
hands to signify South it gets harder to
tell<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.139> south<00:03:13.620> oh<00:03:14.150> okay<00:03:15.150> alright<00:03:15.450> alright

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
tell that south oh okay alright alright

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.470 
tell that south oh okay alright alright
now<00:03:16.049> I<00:03:16.079> get<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.350> now<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.709> get<00:03:17.010> it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
now I get it now I get it

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.940 
now I get it now I get it
south<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> south-facing<00:03:19.049> shelter

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
south so it's a south-facing shelter

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.780 
south so it's a south-facing shelter
it's<00:03:20.790> solar<00:03:21.329> powered<00:03:21.560> yeah<00:03:22.560> yeah<00:03:23.100> yeah<00:03:23.549> it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it's solar powered yeah yeah yeah it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.970 
it's solar powered yeah yeah yeah it's
nice<00:03:24.060> right<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.569> front<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.260> warm

kind o so it's this probably isn't good
this<00:03:32.230> might<00:03:32.500> last<00:03:32.710> if<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.580> keep<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.850> dry

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
this might last if you can keep it dry

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.310 
this might last if you can keep it dry
and<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.510> looks<00:03:34.660> like<00:03:34.720> you've<00:03:34.930> got<00:03:35.140> your
