how to install the thick MPC style pads
for<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.090> native<00:00:09.389> instruments<00:00:09.540> maschine<00:00:10.250> not

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
for the native instruments maschine not

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.039 
for the native instruments maschine not
only<00:00:11.400> did<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:11.880> thicker<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.750> also

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
only did we make them thicker we also

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.680 
only did we make them thicker we also
rounded<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> edges<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> thick<00:00:15.120> pads<00:00:15.360> on

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
rounded the edges on the thick pads on

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260 
rounded the edges on the thick pads on
these<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.949> npcs<00:00:17.490> are<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.180> they're

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
these just like the npcs are so they're

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.849 
these just like the npcs are so they're
not<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> jagged<00:00:18.840> edge<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> original<00:00:19.680> ones

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
not a jagged edge like the original ones

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
not a jagged edge like the original ones
we<00:00:20.310> made<00:00:20.490> them<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> little<00:00:20.789> bit<00:00:21.060> softer

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
we made them a little bit softer

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029 
we made them a little bit softer
although<00:00:22.109> since<00:00:22.350> they're<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.800> thicker

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
although since they're a little thicker

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.830 
although since they're a little thicker
it's<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> feel<00:00:23.789> probably<00:00:24.539> about<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's going to feel probably about the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
it's going to feel probably about the
same<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.260> haven't<00:00:25.800> tested<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.160> yet<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
same I haven't tested it yet this is a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.540 
same I haven't tested it yet this is a
prototype<00:00:27.000> set<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.689> once<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.260> test<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> well<00:00:29.400> no

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
prototype set so once I test it well no

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.890 
prototype set so once I test it well no
but<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.820> figured<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> test<00:00:30.570> them

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
but I figured when I test them

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.240 
but I figured when I test them
I<00:00:30.929> made<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> might<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.619> well<00:00:31.710> make<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.920> video

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
I made it might as well make the video

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
I made it might as well make the video
on<00:00:32.369> how<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> install<00:00:32.790> them<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.050> we're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
on how to install them so now we're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so I'm going to take the wood panels off

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
so I'm going to take the wood panels off
first<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.210> to

first and then I'm going to get to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.960 
first and then I'm going to get to
taking<00:01:03.629> apart<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> machine<00:01:04.640> okay<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
taking apart the machine okay now that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
taking apart the machine okay now that
we<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.180> our<00:01:06.270> wood<00:01:06.390> panels<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:06.960> we're<00:01:07.710> going

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
we got our wood panels off we're going

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
we got our wood panels off we're going
to<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> rest<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> knobs<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to take the rest of the knobs off and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.490 
to take the rest of the knobs off and
we're<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> turn<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.170> upside

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
we're going to turn this thing upside

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.080 
we're going to turn this thing upside
down<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.280> towards<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> back<00:01:11.820> side

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
down so we can get towards the back side

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.030 
down so we can get towards the back side
what<00:01:12.630> I'd<00:01:12.720> suggest<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.229> used<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.830> sort<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
what I'd suggest is used in some sort of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
what I'd suggest is used in some sort of
foam<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.670> pillow<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.659> something<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
foam or a pillow or something like that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
foam or a pillow or something like that
that<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> encoders<00:01:17.130> don't<00:01:17.939> get<00:01:18.150> messed

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that way the encoders don't get messed

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.969 
that way the encoders don't get messed
up<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> turn<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.200> its<00:01:19.380> backside<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
up when you turn it on its backside to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
up when you turn it on its backside to
open<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:25.460> now<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
open it up from the back now that we

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
open it up from the back now that we
have<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> set<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> foam<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have it set on the foam you're going to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
kind of pull it forward or pull backward

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.570 
kind of pull it forward or pull backward
a<00:02:57.630> little<00:02:57.660> bit<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.080> way<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> it'll<00:02:59.070> work<00:02:59.220> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
a little bit this way and it'll work so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.280 
a little bit this way and it'll work so
once<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.850> get<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.210> off<00:03:00.420> we're<00:03:00.990> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> pull

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
once we get this off we're going to pull

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
once we get this off we're going to pull
it<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.470> pull<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.920> away<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.030> put<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:04.020> aside<00:03:04.310> now

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
it up pull it away and put it aside now

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.130 
it up pull it away and put it aside now
you'll<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.730> come<00:03:06.420> across<00:03:06.660> all<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> buttons

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
you'll see come across all the buttons

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.660 
you'll see come across all the buttons
on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> back<00:03:07.410> these<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.220> essentially<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
on the back these are essentially the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
on the back these are essentially the
pad<00:03:08.820> sensors<00:03:09.270> you'll<00:03:09.960> see<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> back<00:03:10.350> side<00:03:10.620> has

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
pad sensors you'll see the back side has

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.070 
pad sensors you'll see the back side has
like<00:03:10.950> carbon<00:03:11.370> type<00:03:11.610> thing<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.600> back<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
like carbon type thing on the back and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.950 
like carbon type thing on the back and
in<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.860> front<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:15.240> more<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.660> shiny

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
in the front is like more of a shiny

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.210 
in the front is like more of a shiny
side<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:18.450> shiny<00:03:18.720> side<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> side<00:03:19.800> that's

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
side the shiny side is the side that's

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.380 
side the shiny side is the side that's
going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.520> go<00:03:21.230> against<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> pads<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.090> then

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
going to go against the pads and then

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.330 
going to go against the pads and then
the<00:03:24.990> sensor<00:03:25.320> side<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.620> going<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.800> go<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.010> way

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
the sensor side is going to go this way

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.120 
the sensor side is going to go this way
we're<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.120> get<00:03:27.210> these<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.690> way

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
we're going to get these out of the way

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.460 
we're going to get these out of the way
and<00:03:29.130> we're<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.490> install<00:03:29.790> our<00:03:30.170> MPC<00:03:31.170> stuff

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and we're going to install our MPC stuff

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.310 
and we're going to install our MPC stuff
thick<00:03:32.310> pads<00:03:32.580> with<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.540> rounded<00:03:33.840> edges<00:03:33.990> like

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
thick pads with the rounded edges like

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.050 
thick pads with the rounded edges like
the<00:03:34.440> NPC's<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.250> here<00:03:36.000> as<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.460> see<00:03:38.580> here

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the NPC's on here as you can see here

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
the NPC's on here as you can see here
the<00:03:39.570> difference<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.740> thickness<00:03:40.980> is

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the difference and the thickness is

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.870 
the difference and the thickness is
pretty<00:03:41.940> substantial<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:44.310> may<00:03:44.460> note<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
pretty substantial you may note on the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.460 
pretty substantial you may note on the
top<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> these<00:03:45.240> pads<00:03:45.540> these<00:03:46.170> are<00:03:46.350> our

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
top of these pads these are our

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.050 
top of these pads these are our
prototype<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.280> you'll<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.610> little<00:03:47.760> bit<00:03:47.940> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
prototype so you'll see a little bit of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.200 
prototype so you'll see a little bit of
scoring<00:03:48.870> from<00:03:49.080> our<00:03:49.200> mold<00:03:49.610> but<00:03:50.610> they<00:03:50.910> won't<00:03:51.090> be

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
scoring from our mold but they won't be

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.400 
scoring from our mold but they won't be
like<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.390> by<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> time<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.050> get<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
like that by the time they get to you

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860 
like that by the time they get to you
but<00:03:53.220> as<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.760> see<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.390> thickness<00:03:54.630> is

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
but as you can see the thickness is

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.390 
but as you can see the thickness is
substantial<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.770> we're<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> put<00:03:56.310> them

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
substantial and we're going to put them

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.670 
substantial and we're going to put them
on<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.520> machine<00:03:56.640> now<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.900> see<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
on the machine now so you can see the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.780 
on the machine now so you can see the
difference<00:03:59.070> when<00:03:59.220> they're<00:03:59.340> actually<00:03:59.610> on<00:03:59.700> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
difference when they're actually on the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.500 
difference when they're actually on the
machine<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.570> playability<00:04:00.990> difference

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
machine and the playability difference

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.370 
machine and the playability difference
alright<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> thick

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
alright so now that we have the thick

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.440 
alright so now that we have the thick
pads<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.830> we're<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.550> put<00:04:05.640> our<00:04:06.060> sensors

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
pads on we're going to put our sensors

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.690 
pads on we're going to put our sensors
back<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.840> top<00:04:07.080> again<00:04:07.410> remember<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> sensors

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
back on top again remember the sensors

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.270 
back on top again remember the sensors
go<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.750> way<00:04:09.960> up<00:04:10.200> top<00:04:10.530> which<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.070> more

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
go this way up top which is the more

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
go this way up top which is the more
matte<00:04:11.550> colored<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.300> that's<00:04:13.290> going<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.500> go

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
matte colored and that's going to go

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.020 
matte colored and that's going to go
towards<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:13.980> top<00:04:14.160> where<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.490> sensors<00:04:14.850> are

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
towards the top where the sensors are

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.520 
towards the top where the sensors are
and<00:04:15.240> now<00:04:15.750> we're<00:04:15.990> just<00:04:16.080> going<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.290> do<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
and now we're just going to do the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.530 
and now we're just going to do the
reverse<00:04:16.770> order<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.130> what<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.520> did<00:04:17.760> we're

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
reverse order of what we just did we're

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.780 
reverse order of what we just did we're
going<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.810> put<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:22.109> board<00:04:22.380> back<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.610> one

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
going to put the board back on the one

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.980 
going to put the board back on the one
thing<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.090> remember<00:04:24.120> when<00:04:24.570> you're<00:04:24.690> doing<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
thing to remember when you're doing the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.070 
thing to remember when you're doing the
board<00:04:25.169> on<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.380> back<00:04:25.500> side

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
board on the back side

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.740 
board on the back side
is<00:04:26.139> that<00:04:26.680> all<00:04:26.949> these<00:04:27.370> screws<00:04:27.849> that<00:04:28.479> have<00:04:28.689> a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
is that all these screws that have a

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.499 
is that all these screws that have a
little<00:04:29.020> screw<00:04:29.349> hole<00:04:29.849> right<00:04:30.849> there<00:04:30.909> next<00:04:31.389> to

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
little screw hole right there next to

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.300 
little screw hole right there next to
them<00:04:31.599> let<00:04:32.349> me<00:04:32.409> try<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.650> get<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:32.979> thing<00:04:33.189> in

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
them let me try to get this thing in

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.689 
them let me try to get this thing in

to it and have a little picture of a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.230 
to it and have a little picture of a
screw<00:04:38.340> that's<00:04:39.340> where<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.729> put<00:04:39.879> screws

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
screw that's where you put screws

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.879 
screw that's where you put screws
there's<00:04:40.659> certain<00:04:40.960> ones<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.229> don't<00:04:41.500> like

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
there's certain ones that don't like

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.719 
there's certain ones that don't like
down<00:04:42.129> here<00:04:42.599> one<00:04:43.599> down<00:04:43.780> here<00:04:44.259> over<00:04:44.580> here

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
down here one down here over here

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.610 
down here one down here over here
those<00:04:46.389> ones<00:04:46.659> aren't<00:04:46.930> going<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.169> get<00:04:47.259> a<00:04:47.319> screw

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
those ones aren't going to get a screw

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.899 
those ones aren't going to get a screw
in<00:04:47.710> them<00:04:47.830> because<00:04:48.370> when<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> put<00:04:48.819> the

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
in them because when you put the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.540 
in them because when you put the
backplate<00:04:49.419> back<00:04:49.599> on<00:04:50.039> that's<00:04:51.039> where<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> hole

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
backplate back on that's where the hole

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.279 
backplate back on that's where the hole
these<00:04:51.789> holes<00:04:52.030> are<00:04:52.210> going<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.419> factor<00:04:52.569> it<00:04:52.900> so

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
these holes are going to factor it so

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.300 
these holes are going to factor it so
make<00:04:53.439> sure<00:04:53.469> that<00:04:53.650> when<00:04:53.919> you're<00:04:54.069> putting<00:04:54.250> these

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
make sure that when you're putting these

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.820 
make sure that when you're putting these
back<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.699> the<00:04:54.879> silver<00:04:55.330> screws<00:04:55.629> only<00:04:56.259> go<00:04:56.439> where

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
back in the silver screws only go where

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.010 
back in the silver screws only go where
there's<00:04:56.979> a<00:04:57.039> little<00:04:57.280> screw<00:04:57.639> indicator<00:04:58.569> next<00:04:58.930> to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
there's a little screw indicator next to

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.899 
there's a little screw indicator next to
it<00:04:59.139> so<00:04:59.590> let's<00:04:59.620> put<00:04:59.889> those<00:05:00.009> all<00:05:00.219> back<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.639> and

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
it so let's put those all back on and

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.219 
it so let's put those all back on and
then<00:05:01.270> we'll<00:05:01.389> put<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.599> back<00:05:01.750> plate<00:05:02.050> back<00:05:02.199> on

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
then we'll put the back plate back on

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.589 
then we'll put the back plate back on
and<00:05:02.469> we'll<00:05:02.770> show<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:02.949> how<00:05:03.069> these<00:05:03.340> work<00:05:03.599> all

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
and we'll show you how these work all

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.059 
and we'll show you how these work all
right<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.930> figured<00:05:05.289> we'd<00:05:05.440> also<00:05:05.710> show<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:05.979> a

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
right I figured we'd also show you a

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.589 
right I figured we'd also show you a
little<00:05:06.219> bit<00:05:06.340> now<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.210> they've<00:05:07.330> been<00:05:07.419> then

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
little bit now that they've been then

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.379 
little bit now that they've been then
installed<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.860> can<00:05:09.009> see<00:05:09.219> they're<00:05:10.120> thicker

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
installed you can see they're thicker

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.350 
installed you can see they're thicker
the<00:05:11.349> way<00:05:11.469> they<00:05:11.620> come<00:05:11.800> up<00:05:11.979> it<00:05:12.909> looks<00:05:13.120> so<00:05:13.330> much

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
the way they come up it looks so much

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.540 
the way they come up it looks so much
better

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
better

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.589 
better
considering<00:05:15.550> your<00:05:15.669> old<00:05:15.789> pads<00:05:16.060> used<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.449> come

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
considering your old pads used to come

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.930 
considering your old pads used to come
up<00:05:16.629> about<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:17.349> much<00:05:17.590> again<00:05:18.190> you'll<00:05:18.610> see<00:05:18.789> the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
up about that much again you'll see the

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.869 
up about that much again you'll see the
from<00:05:19.449> our<00:05:19.569> mold<00:05:19.889> where<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:21.009> CNC<00:05:21.460> pulled<00:05:21.759> it

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
from our mold where the CNC pulled it

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.640 
from our mold where the CNC pulled it
through<00:05:21.909> so<00:05:22.330> yours<00:05:22.840> will<00:05:23.050> not<00:05:23.139> have<00:05:23.409> that

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
through so yours will not have that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.619 
through so yours will not have that
that's<00:05:23.889> just<00:05:24.159> on<00:05:24.279> the<00:05:24.310> prototypes<00:05:24.849> here<00:05:25.120> yours

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
that's just on the prototypes here yours

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:26.909 
that's just on the prototypes here yours
will<00:05:25.750> be<00:05:25.840> completely<00:05:26.229> flat<00:05:26.439> like<00:05:26.770> the

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
will be completely flat like the

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.040 
will be completely flat like the
original<00:05:27.279> pads<00:05:27.460> on<00:05:27.699> the<00:05:27.789> top<00:05:28.000> again<00:05:28.750> these<00:05:28.900> are

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
original pads on the top again these are

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.570 
original pads on the top again these are
just<00:05:29.080> prototypes<00:05:29.469> we're<00:05:30.250> going<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.460> have

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
just prototypes we're going to have

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.459 
just prototypes we're going to have
these<00:05:30.729> available<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.509> different<00:05:32.110> colors

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
these available in different colors

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.550 
these available in different colors
you're<00:05:32.620> going<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.830> have<00:05:33.719> like<00:05:34.719> a<00:05:34.750> blue<00:05:35.080> clear

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
you're going to have like a blue clear

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.260 
you're going to have like a blue clear
you're<00:05:35.860> going<00:05:35.979> to<00:05:36.039> have<00:05:36.129> a<00:05:36.159> smoke<00:05:36.759> color<00:05:36.969> Kia

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
you're going to have a smoke color Kia

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.040 
you're going to have a smoke color Kia
clear<00:05:39.029> gray<00:05:40.029> which<00:05:40.330> will<00:05:40.449> be<00:05:40.569> actually<00:05:40.810> not

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
clear gray which will be actually not

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.279 
clear gray which will be actually not
clear<00:05:41.500> but<00:05:41.710> it'll<00:05:41.860> be<00:05:41.919> like<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.159> MPC<00:05:42.729> style

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
clear but it'll be like the MPC style

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.629 
clear but it'll be like the MPC style
and<00:05:44.289> then<00:05:44.830> we're<00:05:44.919> also<00:05:45.039> going<00:05:45.159> to<00:05:45.219> have<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.400> red

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
and then we're also going to have a red

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.969 
and then we're also going to have a red
clear<00:05:45.940> as<00:05:46.060> well<00:05:46.529> now<00:05:47.529> I'm<00:05:47.650> going<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:47.830> show<00:05:47.949> you

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
clear as well now I'm going to show you

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.430 
clear as well now I'm going to show you
pretty<00:05:48.460> much<00:05:48.779> I'm<00:05:49.779> going<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.020> shut<00:05:50.349> out<00:05:50.409> the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
pretty much I'm going to shut out the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.480 
pretty much I'm going to shut out the
lights<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.740> little<00:05:50.800> bit<00:05:50.919> so<00:05:51.099> you<00:05:51.159> can<00:05:51.219> see<00:05:51.310> how

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
lights a little bit so you can see how

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.769 
lights a little bit so you can see how
everything<00:05:51.819> lights<00:05:52.029> up<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.539> way<00:05:52.659> it

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
everything lights up and the way it

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.200 
everything lights up and the way it
works<00:05:53.020> but<00:05:53.650> again<00:05:54.310> this<00:05:54.639> is<00:05:54.789> how<00:05:54.819> it<00:05:54.969> looks

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
works but again this is how it looks

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.399 
works but again this is how it looks
once<00:05:55.449> it's<00:05:55.629> on<00:05:57.509> with<00:05:58.509> the<00:05:58.539> rounded<00:05:59.020> edges

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
once it's on with the rounded edges

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.219 
once it's on with the rounded edges
rather<00:06:00.250> than<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.669> squared<00:06:01.629> edges<00:06:01.810> like<00:06:02.199> that

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
rather than the squared edges like that

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.730 
rather than the squared edges like that
original<00:06:03.159> one<00:06:03.279> uses<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:05.050> now<00:06:05.529> I'm<00:06:05.589> going<00:06:05.680> to

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
original one uses and now I'm going to

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.950 
original one uses and now I'm going to
show<00:06:05.860> you<00:06:05.889> how<00:06:06.039> they<00:06:06.159> play<00:06:06.629> all<00:06:07.629> right<00:06:07.779> now

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
show you how they play all right now

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.409 
show you how they play all right now
that<00:06:08.110> we<00:06:08.199> have<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.409> pads<00:06:08.620> installed<00:06:09.419> they

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
that we have the pads installed they

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.159 
that we have the pads installed they
look<00:06:10.690> awesome

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
look awesome

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.829 
look awesome
they're<00:06:11.800> a<00:06:11.830> lot<00:06:12.039> thicker<00:06:12.279> than<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:13.509> regular

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
they're a lot thicker than the regular

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.990 
they're a lot thicker than the regular
pads<00:06:14.080> like<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:15.039> talked<00:06:15.250> about<00:06:15.310> before<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:15.879> can

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
pads like I talked about before you can

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.249 
pads like I talked about before you can
see<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.180> little<00:06:16.270> scoring<00:06:16.629> on<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.779> top<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.110> them

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
see a little scoring on the top of them

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.689 
see a little scoring on the top of them
that's<00:06:17.560> just<00:06:17.830> from<00:06:18.009> our<00:06:18.159> molds<00:06:18.460> because<00:06:18.520> these

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
that's just from our molds because these

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.700 
that's just from our molds because these
are<00:06:18.879> a<00:06:18.909> prototype<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.779> runs<00:06:20.080> will<00:06:20.289> not<00:06:20.500> look

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
are a prototype the runs will not look

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.499 
are a prototype the runs will not look
like<00:06:20.889> that<00:06:20.919> they're<00:06:21.759> also<00:06:21.909> going<00:06:22.089> to<00:06:22.150> come<00:06:22.330> in

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
like that they're also going to come in

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.969 
like that they're also going to come in
clear<00:06:22.930> we're<00:06:23.110> going<00:06:23.229> to<00:06:23.289> have<00:06:23.409> like<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.589> smoke

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
clear we're going to have like a smoke

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.279 
clear we're going to have like a smoke
color<00:06:24.250> we're<00:06:24.849> going<00:06:25.000> to<00:06:25.060> have<00:06:25.150> a<00:06:25.180> red<00:06:25.449> red

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
color we're going to have a red red

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.050 
color we're going to have a red red
clear<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.919> there's<00:06:27.219> gonna<00:06:27.310> be<00:06:27.400> a<00:06:27.460> blue<00:06:27.669> clear

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
clear and there's gonna be a blue clear

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.119 
clear and there's gonna be a blue clear
and<00:06:28.839> then<00:06:28.960> we're<00:06:29.080> also<00:06:29.229> going<00:06:29.379> to<00:06:29.440> have<00:06:29.589> MPC

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
and then we're also going to have MPC

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.499 
and then we're also going to have MPC
style<00:06:30.430> which<00:06:30.580> is<00:06:30.699> not<00:06:30.849> going<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.029> be<00:06:31.120> light<00:06:31.330> up

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
style which is not going to be light up

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.309 
style which is not going to be light up
but<00:06:32.050> it's<00:06:32.169> going<00:06:32.289> to<00:06:32.349> be<00:06:32.469> gray<00:06:32.770> like<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:33.129> NPC's

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
but it's going to be gray like the NPC's

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.749 
but it's going to be gray like the NPC's
so<00:06:35.319> now<00:06:35.440> when<00:06:35.680> you<00:06:35.800> what<00:06:36.219> you'll<00:06:36.339> realize<00:06:36.610> at

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
so now when you what you'll realize at

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.040 
so now when you what you'll realize at
first<00:06:36.789> we're<00:06:37.180> playing<00:06:37.539> these<00:06:37.690> think<00:06:37.930> they

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
first we're playing these think they

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.010 
first we're playing these think they
just<00:06:38.229> feel<00:06:38.409> so<00:06:38.740> much

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
just feel so much

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.900 
just feel so much
better<00:06:39.230> it<00:06:39.590> actually<00:06:40.160> feels<00:06:40.550> a<00:06:40.610> little<00:06:40.700> bit

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
better it actually feels a little bit

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.310 
better it actually feels a little bit
loose<00:06:41.240> almost<00:06:41.660> in<00:06:41.810> there<00:06:41.930> even<00:06:42.200> though

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
loose almost in there even though

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.200 
loose almost in there even though
they're<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:42.470> exact<00:06:42.920> same<00:06:42.950> outside<00:06:43.580> it's<00:06:44.120> just

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
they're the exact same outside it's just

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.090 
they're the exact same outside it's just
because<00:06:44.600> the<00:06:44.780> height<00:06:45.110> of<00:06:45.290> the<00:06:45.380> pads<00:06:45.590> makes<00:06:45.980> it

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
because the height of the pads makes it

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.490 
because the height of the pads makes it
just<00:06:46.190> feel<00:06:46.490> easier<00:06:46.940> to<00:06:47.030> play<00:06:47.240> better<00:06:47.960> you<00:06:48.170> kind

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
just feel easier to play better you kind

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.430 
just feel easier to play better you kind
of<00:06:48.530> feel<00:06:48.770> the<00:06:48.920> pads<00:06:49.130> around<00:06:50.050> it's<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.170> way<00:06:51.350> it

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
of feel the pads around it's the way it

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.630 
of feel the pads around it's the way it
should<00:06:51.500> have<00:06:51.620> been<00:06:51.770> designed<00:06:52.070> to<00:06:52.190> begin<00:06:52.460> with

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
should have been designed to begin with

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.820 
should have been designed to begin with
unfortunately<00:06:53.390> it<00:06:53.720> wasn't<00:06:53.900> but<00:06:54.290> we<00:06:54.440> have<00:06:54.650> at

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
unfortunately it wasn't but we have at

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.280 
unfortunately it wasn't but we have at
MPC<00:06:55.100> stuff<00:06:55.490> made<00:06:55.760> them<00:06:55.910> so<00:06:56.480> like<00:06:56.960> I<00:06:57.050> said<00:06:57.110> we

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290 
MPC stuff made them so like I said we

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.720 
MPC stuff made them so like I said we
got<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:57.470> thick<00:06:57.680> pads<00:06:57.890> now<00:06:58.130> we<00:06:58.190> showed<00:06:58.520> you<00:06:58.640> how

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
got the thick pads now we showed you how

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.570 
got the thick pads now we showed you how
to<00:06:58.790> install<00:06:59.150> them<00:06:59.710> for<00:07:00.710> the<00:07:01.160> native

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
to install them for the native

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.610 
to install them for the native
instruments<00:07:01.760> maschine<00:07:02.120> and<00:07:02.570> the<00:07:03.350> micro

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
instruments maschine and the micro

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.250 
instruments maschine and the micro
machine<00:07:03.650> same<00:07:04.310> pads<00:07:04.580> fit<00:07:04.910> for<00:07:05.150> both<00:07:05.330> we<00:07:06.110> also

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
machine same pads fit for both we also

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.480 
machine same pads fit for both we also
have<00:07:06.500> a<00:07:06.530> video<00:07:06.710> that<00:07:07.070> we're<00:07:07.190> going<00:07:07.280> to<00:07:07.340> release

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
have a video that we're going to release

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.450 
have a video that we're going to release
doing<00:07:08.120> the<00:07:08.330> install<00:07:08.690> on<00:07:08.900> the<00:07:09.110> micro<00:07:09.500> so<00:07:10.250> again

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
doing the install on the micro so again

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.370 
doing the install on the micro so again
you<00:07:10.610> can<00:07:10.700> get<00:07:10.850> these<00:07:10.940> at<00:07:11.120> MPC<00:07:11.480> stuff<00:07:11.900> or

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
you can get these at MPC stuff or

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.220 
you can get these at MPC stuff or
