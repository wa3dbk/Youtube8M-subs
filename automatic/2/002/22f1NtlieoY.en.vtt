00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 stupid niel shock today i je you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.320
 proposes to make rillettes of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 tuna so it's perfect for summer in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.740
 appetizer it's super good so when we 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.150
 would think there is one brews with grace 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 and charcuterie but you will see that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.990
 my version to me is super light and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 delicious you will see all 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.099
 steps in video then in a small 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 salad bowl you will set the tone with 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.430
 strong mustard with of course a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.040
 little bit of mill pepper 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.739
 we add lemon juice at their expense 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.170
 if possible then we continue with 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 finely chopped shallots we continue 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.680
 with cloaks so marc really you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.540
 do not like the capers wanted to remove 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.910
 and you can possibly add 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.460
 small gherkins chiseled then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 continue with fresh chives and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 we will finish by adding cheese 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 white so I put 0% like that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.829
 it's really not serious and after good 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.510
 sure to add the end of the cottage cheese 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.460
 you are there if you so wish 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.390
 close 2 3 tablespoons so like that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.830
 it will actually allow the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.020
 rillettes not too dry otherwise 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 it's still not very good and then 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 a voice is more than mixing would do 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.550
 adjust the seasoning so I have 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.649
 added weight because without missing 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.569
 after to buy chives or 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.520
 other things pickles capers 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.349
 finally here is after it's really next 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.459
 everyone's tastes 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.020
 then you put a little movie 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.729
 plastic and you put in the fridge for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.349
 at least a little hour it is tasted 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.899
 really very very fresh on toast 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.399
 bread crackers even crispy 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.069
 if you want to end that's it 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.970
