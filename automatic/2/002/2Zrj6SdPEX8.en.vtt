 ceylon black tea english breakfast 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.140
 baymah y 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.590
 chinese white tea earl gray bergamot 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.160
 you are also huangshan motion jesh al saud 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:27.570
 john drank very cum just chinese 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:29.580
 yellow tea ceylon black tea and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 chinese white tea bai mu tribute 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.380
 which today we will have brewed and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 drunk instead of wine 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.620
 using tea instead of wine is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 pretty new topic in gastronomic 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.450
 culture but the topic is very interesting and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.190
 very promising tea with wine or with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.620
 other alcohol is drunk for a long time and the most 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.690
 in different ways they are merged together and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 drink separately but alternate with 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 friend and so on and so forth but 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 This is only half tea wine 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.410
 tea culture can not only complement 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 wine or vice versa wine tea tea 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.859
 great to replace the link in his very 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.840
 main gastronomic 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.960
 functionality and here everything is very 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.830
 just basic wines with gastronomic 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.490
 points of view 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.950
 2 is red wine and white wine if we 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.710
 greatly simplify tastes and flavors 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.680
 these rens, we get something like this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.770
 picture red wine in terms of 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.850
 gastronomia drink for his tartness for his 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.340
 I'm nasty for his rich white wine 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.229
 in terms of gastronomie and drink because 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 that it is fresh because it has 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.240
 floral and light fruit notes after 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
 how such a layout for taste and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.829
 to replace with a scent or 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.280
 pick tea that will replace the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.170
 or another wine is very simple tart tea with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 bright notes can be with vanilla 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 which imitates a little vannir 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.680
 caused by red oak on this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.540
 Of course black tea with astringency him all 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790
 okay and we brew here in 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 as such substitutes for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.869
 Ceylon black tea tea in which there is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.390
 fresh notes eat fruit and eat light 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.550
 herb is any light tea either 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.099
 white either green or yellow we 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.770
 try white bye mu tribute which 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.840
 just brew boiling water and give it to him 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.410
 stand one minute during this time with us 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 by the way already perfectly brewed black schA 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.270
 how can these teas be used 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.400
 instead of wine , first they need to be given 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.230
 don't cool down pretty much 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.810
 they will not be cooled much otherwise 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.430
 no taste at all but you stand 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.190
 traditionally quite hot 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 the temperature at which we drink their tea is not 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.420
 it is necessary because gastronomic 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.750
 the functionality of tea if we replace it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.850
 wine 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.080
 is to complement well and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.640
 evaluate the dish what dishes usually 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.850
 accompanied by white wines 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.440
 white meat white fish lungs some 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.080
 fruit salads and snacks 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 light cheese and what dishes usually 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.720
 accompanied by red wine red meat 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.110
 some rich fish dishes something 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.780
 spicy something bright grill picture exactly 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 the same of teas if we make kebabs 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.190
 and for some reason we can not drink 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.770
 wine we can serve black 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.420
 tea guests may perceive it 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 original but in the end will remain 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.980
 happy if we cooked dorada on 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.230
 couple for some tricky to 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.959
 raevskomu recipe for example with celery 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.120
 a fish and that, too, and Chris and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.490
 perfectly complement very well fit 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.410
 White tea 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.650
 where do you really know 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.050
 black tea mix as a substitute 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.910
 red wine with some meat dishes 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.430
 she still wears a little pulled 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.680
 behind the ears of character well, such a replacement you know 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 almost forced it's white tea 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.370
 fish dishes and with the same lungs 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.070
 rice or vegetable side dishes 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.380
 combined just amazing and now 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.330
 let's get the wine meal 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.250
 we are such an aristocratic snack 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.170
 very modest which implies that 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 our wine is so cool and that 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.350
 no snack required and tea which 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.810
 we will replace 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.670
 this wine is also absolutely fantastic 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.800
 and we master this know 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.230
 universally tea wine appetizer 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.570
 which is called a finger sandwich 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.790
 in Russian finger sandwich he usually 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.270
 made from two pieces of bread and one 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.580
 a piece of cheese but we will make it in our 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.740
 option and put two pieces of cheese and 3 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.740
 slices bread generous soul try 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.340
 drunk from a bowl 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.010
 combination 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.330
 cheese with bread from tea expect 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.840
 anything else was impossible 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:46.000
 risk with a glass is enough for me already scary 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.340
 the glass is very, very malicious 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.750
 mist over but it looks great on 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.820
 my opinion was very beautiful and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.330
 Now we will try a little dad 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.310
 getting married 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.470
 here is exactly the case when 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.210
 repeating at home is not necessary now we 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.160
 We do it just for show all 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.330
 hot tea from a glass cup is not 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.420
 safe for health 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.650
 black tea instead of red wine 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.840
 aristocratic sandwich of three 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:17.020
 pieces of bread and two pieces of cheese in 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.130
 as a light meal piece of cheese 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.970
 very good 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.970
 tea see you
