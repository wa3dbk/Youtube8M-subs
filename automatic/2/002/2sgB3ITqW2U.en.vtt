some pipes and some energy you can get

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.839 
some pipes and some energy you can get
two<00:01:18.279> things<00:01:18.549> running<00:01:20.279> here<00:01:21.279> you<00:01:21.369> can<00:01:21.579> see<00:01:21.789> the

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:21.849 
two things running here you can see the

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:24.419 
two things running here you can see the
range<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.569> a<00:01:22.599> little<00:01:22.929> bit<00:01:23.079> of<00:01:23.200> fertility<00:01:23.679> which

range of a little bit of fertility which

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.739 
range of a little bit of fertility which
is<00:01:24.869> seven<00:01:25.869> by<00:01:26.469> seven<00:01:26.979> we<00:01:27.670> repaired<00:01:28.359> in<00:01:28.569> the

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
is seven by seven we repaired in the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.859 
is seven by seven we repaired in the
middle<00:01:29.459> on<00:01:30.459> the<00:01:30.579> other<00:01:30.909> hand<00:01:31.179> you<00:01:31.359> can<00:01:31.630> you

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
middle on the other hand you can you

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.080 
middle on the other hand you can you
could<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.240> way<00:01:35.069> but<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.399> course<00:01:36.700> it's

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
could do it this way but of course it's

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.779 
could do it this way but of course it's
just<00:01:37.689> waste<00:01:37.929> for<00:01:38.200> what<00:01:38.349> just<00:01:38.709> one<00:01:38.919> crop<00:01:39.249> to

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
just waste for what just one crop to

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.539 
just waste for what just one crop to
boost<00:01:39.999> the<00:01:40.209> efficiency<00:01:40.779> you<00:01:40.929> have<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.200> setup

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
boost the efficiency you have to setup

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.800 
boost the efficiency you have to setup
you<00:01:42.549> enlarge<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.359> area<00:01:44.489> because<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.630> lily

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
you enlarge the area because the lily

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.729 
you enlarge the area because the lily
pads<00:01:47.139> on<00:01:47.499> the<00:01:47.619> outside<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:49.380> boost<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.619> growth

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:50.739 
pads on the outside can boost the growth

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.149 
pads on the outside can boost the growth
rate<00:01:51.279> of<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:52.090> seeds<00:01:52.359> in<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.719> middle<00:01:52.779> and<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
rate of the seeds in the middle and the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.229 
rate of the seeds in the middle and the
bigger<00:01:54.459> area<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.829> more<00:01:57.009> efficient<00:01:57.429> setup<00:01:58.029> get

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
bigger area so more efficient setup get

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.649 
bigger area so more efficient setup get
for<00:01:59.229> an<00:01:59.319> efficient<00:01:59.919> setup<00:02:00.279> there's<00:02:01.149> one<00:02:01.479> more

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
for an efficient setup there's one more

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.589 
for an efficient setup there's one more
important<00:02:02.109> thing<00:02:02.169> if<00:02:02.739> you<00:02:03.189> use<00:02:03.219> em<00:02:04.209> of<00:02:04.450> our

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
important thing if you use em of our

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.160 
important thing if you use em of our
harvester<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:06.579> have<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.880> use<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.599> right<00:02:07.779> up

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
harvester you have to use the right up

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.440 
harvester you have to use the right up
upgrades<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.879> I<00:02:10.030> input<00:02:10.239> upgrade<00:02:11.140> here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
upgrades so if I input upgrade here

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.820 
upgrades so if I input upgrade here
the<00:02:14.380> harvester<00:02:14.860> how<00:02:15.069> was<00:02:15.599> 3x3<00:02:16.599> feared<00:02:17.140> but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the harvester how was 3x3 feared but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.589 
the harvester how was 3x3 feared but
with<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> upgrade<00:02:18.870> plus<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.270> take<00:02:22.450> him

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
with the upgrade plus one if I take him

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.180 
with the upgrade plus one if I take him
out<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.020> put<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:24.180> upgrade<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.680> radius<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.950> in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
out and put a upgrade this radius to in

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.460 
out and put a upgrade this radius to in
it<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:29.770> can<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.160> here<00:02:30.700> artists<00:02:31.209> outside<00:02:31.750> too

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
it you can see here artists outside too

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.630 
it you can see here artists outside too
the<00:02:33.250> problem<00:02:33.610> now<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.270> use<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:35.640> upgrade

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
the problem now is if you use a upgrade

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.420 
the problem now is if you use a upgrade
with<00:02:36.880> too<00:02:37.180> much<00:02:37.300> for<00:02:37.540> radius<00:02:40.860> he<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:42.160> needs

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
with too much for radius he just needs

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
with too much for radius he just needs
more<00:02:42.550> time<00:02:43.000> because<00:02:43.300> he<00:02:43.630> even<00:02:43.959> scans<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:45.010> area

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
more time because he even scans the area

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.199 
more time because he even scans the area
and<00:02:47.350> since<00:02:48.130> directions<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.760> blocks<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and since directions this blocks is

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.430 
and since directions this blocks is
