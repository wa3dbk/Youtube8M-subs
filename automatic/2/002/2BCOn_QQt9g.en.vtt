that<00:02:33.020> comes<00:02:33.200> through<00:02:33.440> here<00:02:33.680> again<00:02:33.830> making<00:02:34.550> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
that comes through here again making it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.600 
that comes through here again making it
nice<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.030> comfortable<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:36.440> front<00:02:36.739> the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
nice and comfortable on the front the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.570 
nice and comfortable on the front the
set<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.910> pockets<00:02:38.300> towards<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.780> front<00:02:39.020> here

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
set of pockets towards the front here

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.800 
set of pockets towards the front here
nice<00:02:40.580> way<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.819> organize<00:02:41.030> all<00:02:41.360> your<00:02:41.450> bits<00:02:41.630> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
nice way to organize all your bits and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.559 
nice way to organize all your bits and
pieces<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.670> then<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> other<00:02:44.209> pod<00:02:44.450> on

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
pieces and then we have the other pod on

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.240 
pieces and then we have the other pod on
the<00:02:44.690> other<00:02:44.810> side<00:02:45.080> as<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.770> can<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:46.130> do<00:02:46.220> have

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the other side as you can see we do have

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.040 
the other side as you can see we do have
a<00:02:46.370> mesh<00:02:46.610> net<00:02:46.910> attached<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> front<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.900> well

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
a mesh net attached to the front as well

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.300 
a mesh net attached to the front as well
so<00:02:48.350> again<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.860> allow<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.069> air<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
so again you can allow the air to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.640 
so again you can allow the air to
circulate<00:02:49.610> around<00:02:49.970> inside<00:02:50.480> obviously<00:02:51.260> keep

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
circulate around inside obviously keep

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.040 
circulate around inside obviously keep
those<00:02:51.800> bugs<00:02:52.130> out<00:02:52.450> let's<00:02:53.450> go<00:02:53.569> over<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.870> take<00:02:53.989> a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
those bugs out let's go over and take a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.670 
those bugs out let's go over and take a
look<00:02:54.140> at<00:02:54.470> some<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.860> other<00:02:54.890> sizes<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.560> here

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
look at some of the other sizes so here

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.250 
look at some of the other sizes so here
we<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.950> Boston<00:02:58.280> 500<00:02:59.000> shown<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:00.080> with

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
we have the Boston 500 shown here with

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.650 
we have the Boston 500 shown here with
the<00:03:00.410> optional<00:03:00.950> extra<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:02.000> canopy<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the optional extra of the canopy out the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.539 
the optional extra of the canopy out the
front<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.440> just<00:03:03.650> increases<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.250> general

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
front it just increases the general

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.400 
front it just increases the general
living<00:03:04.819> space<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.690> makes<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.900> great<00:03:06.049> added

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
living space so it makes a great added

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.190 
living space so it makes a great added
extra<00:03:06.830> 20<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.549> Boston<00:03:07.940> range<00:03:08.209> does<00:03:08.870> fit<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
extra 20 the Boston range does fit the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.430 
extra 20 the Boston range does fit the
six<00:03:09.530> hundred<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> five<00:03:10.220> hundred<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.819> also<00:03:11.090> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
six hundred to five hundred and also the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.160 
six hundred to five hundred and also the
440<00:03:12.440> not<00:03:12.620> 300<00:03:13.330> if<00:03:14.330> we<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.600> go<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.019> take<00:03:15.110> a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
440 not 300 if we just go in and take a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.740 
440 not 300 if we just go in and take a
look<00:03:15.260> at<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> few<00:03:15.590> differences<00:03:16.010> we<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.750> so

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
look at a few differences we have so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.990 
look at a few differences we have so
here<00:03:17.900> inside<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.350> 500<00:03:19.069> then<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.670> exactly

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
here inside the 500 then we have exactly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.910 
here inside the 500 then we have exactly
the<00:03:20.120> same<00:03:20.180> features<00:03:20.720> as<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:20.959> did<00:03:21.080> in<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> 600

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
the same features as we did in the 600

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.400 
the same features as we did in the 600
just<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.760> slightly<00:03:23.030> smaller<00:03:23.269> living<00:03:23.660> space<00:03:24.110> as

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
just a slightly smaller living space as

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.190 
just a slightly smaller living space as
you<00:03:24.590> can<00:03:24.739> see<00:03:24.950> slightly<00:03:25.430> smaller<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.200> then

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
you can see slightly smaller and then

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.780 
you can see slightly smaller and then

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
there and another two in here exactly

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.199 
there and another two in here exactly

one<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.390> things<00:03:38.540> we<00:03:38.630> did<00:03:38.750> forget<00:03:38.989> to

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
one of the things we did forget to

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.229 
one of the things we did forget to
mention<00:03:39.170> previously<00:03:40.100> with<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.670> bathtub

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
mention previously with the bathtub

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.720 
mention previously with the bathtub
style<00:03:41.540> groundsheet<00:03:42.250> around<00:03:43.250> all<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> door

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
style groundsheet around all the door

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.580 
style groundsheet around all the door
areas<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.570> do<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.959> option<00:03:45.109> of<00:03:45.440> just

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
areas you do have the option of just

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.650 
areas you do have the option of just
lowering<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.190> down<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:47.180> eliminates

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
lowering it down this just eliminates

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.569 
lowering it down this just eliminates
any<00:03:47.810> kind<00:03:48.109> of<00:03:48.200> trip<00:03:48.470> hazard<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.340> if<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.459> do

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
any kind of trip hazard so if you do

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.490 
any kind of trip hazard so if you do
have<00:03:49.790> kids<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.299> won't<00:03:50.359> be<00:03:50.510> falling<00:03:50.870> over<00:03:51.140> you

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
have kids that won't be falling over you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.140 
have kids that won't be falling over you
can<00:03:51.650> flatten<00:03:51.920> that<00:03:52.010> right<00:03:52.280> out<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.000> can

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
can flatten that right out and you can

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.390 
can flatten that right out and you can
walk<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.600> out<00:03:53.690> nice<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.260> easily<00:03:54.400> let's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
walk in and out nice and easily let's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.780 
walk in and out nice and easily let's
now<00:03:55.519> go<00:03:55.640> over<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:55.910> take<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.030> look<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.269> 400

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
now go over and take a look at the 400

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.910 
now go over and take a look at the 400
so<00:03:58.790> here<00:03:58.910> we<00:03:59.000> are<00:03:59.120> now<00:03:59.359> inside<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.720> Boston<00:04:00.200> 400

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
so here we are now inside the Boston 400

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.370 
so here we are now inside the Boston 400
as<00:04:01.519> we<00:04:01.730> said<00:04:01.910> previously<00:04:02.170> exactly<00:04:03.170> all<00:04:03.290> the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
as we said previously exactly all the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.289 
as we said previously exactly all the
same<00:04:03.560> features<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.130> tend<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.400> find<00:04:04.609> just<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.269> a

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
same features you tend to find just on a

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.170 
same features you tend to find just on a
slightly<00:04:05.630> smaller<00:04:05.870> scale<00:04:06.880> slightly<00:04:07.880> smaller

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
slightly smaller scale slightly smaller

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
living space towards the front and we

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.640 
living space towards the front and we
now<00:04:10.640> have<00:04:10.670> obviously<00:04:11.299> up<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.230> four<00:04:12.470> people

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
now have obviously up to four people

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.979 
now have obviously up to four people
sleeping<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.280> here<00:04:13.609> two<00:04:13.880> on<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.209> side<00:04:14.269> and

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
obviously two on the other than that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.979 
obviously two on the other than that
exactly<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> same<00:04:17.930> features<00:04:18.320> throughout<00:04:19.989> and

exactly the same features throughout and

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.990 
exactly the same features throughout and
then<00:04:21.079> here<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.229> are<00:04:21.440> finally<00:04:21.919> on<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.340> smaller

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
then here we are finally on the smaller
