00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
wearing it backwards right now just

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.070 
wearing it backwards right now just
because<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.539> easier<00:01:10.869> for<00:01:10.899> me<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.170> leave

because it's easier for me to leave
people<00:01:14.080> always<00:01:14.380> ask<00:01:14.560> for<00:01:14.950> clarification<00:01:15.670> how

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
people always ask for clarification how

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.540 
people always ask for clarification how
this<00:01:15.970> works<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.009> grab<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.340> top

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
this works so you just grab the top

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.469 
this works so you just grab the top
string<00:01:18.909> pull<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> second<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.440> through<00:01:20.619> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
string pull the second one through it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.350 
string pull the second one through it
and<00:01:22.479> then<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:23.470> third<00:01:23.679> one<00:01:23.830> through<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
and then the third one through that and

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.570 
and then the third one through that and
you<00:01:25.929> can<00:01:26.080> just<00:01:26.259> go<00:01:26.350> down<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.460> make

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
you can just go down and you can make

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.370 
you can just go down and you can make
this<00:01:27.729> as<00:01:27.940> tight<00:01:28.210> or<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:28.479> loose<00:01:28.600> as<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.200> like<00:01:29.409> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380

this as tight or as loose as you like I
usually<00:01:32.380> do<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.770> few<00:01:32.890> times<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.810> I'll<00:01:34.810> make

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
usually do this a few times so I'll make

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.789 
usually do this a few times so I'll make
the<00:01:35.170> first<00:01:35.380> row<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.810> bit<00:01:37.960> tight<00:01:38.319> on<00:01:38.619> the

edge<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:41.819> mean<00:01:42.819> where'd<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.149> get

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
edge like this I mean where'd you get

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.370 
edge like this I mean where'd you get
all<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.539> way<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.810> bottom<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.350> just

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
shirts I recommend just practicing on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.300 
shirts I recommend just practicing on
some<00:02:20.109> shirts<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.709> you're<00:02:20.859> not<00:02:20.980> attached

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
some shirts so that you're not attached

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.180 
some shirts so that you're not attached
to<00:02:21.579> you<00:02:21.670> first<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:23.470> way<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.160> of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
to you first that way you can kind of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.349 
to you first that way you can kind of
get<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> hang<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.790> before<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.209> go

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
get the hang of it before you go

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.039 
get the hang of it before you go
screwing<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:26.079> your<00:02:26.260> favorite<00:02:26.709> shirts<00:02:28.049> I've

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
screwing up on your favorite shirts I've

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:37.850 
screwing up on your favorite shirts I've
done<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.380> more<00:02:29.590> than<00:02:29.709> once<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.780> has

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.580 

so<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.220> depends<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.790> how<00:02:40.300> loose<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.319> you<00:02:41.380> want

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
so it depends on how loose do you want

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.420 
so it depends on how loose do you want
the<00:02:41.740> shirt<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.940> how<00:02:43.150> tight<00:02:43.890> how<00:02:44.890> fancy

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the shirt to be or how tight how fancy

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.160 
the shirt to be or how tight how fancy
you<00:02:45.520> want<00:02:45.730> these<00:02:45.850> knots<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.660> like

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you want these knots to be you like

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.540 
you want these knots to be you like
right<00:02:47.410> now<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.830> medium<00:02:48.280> looseness

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
right now it's that medium looseness

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.309 
right now it's that medium looseness
actually<00:02:49.270> probably<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.660> most<00:02:49.840> comfortable

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
actually probably the most comfortable

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.190 
actually probably the most comfortable
for<00:02:50.560> me<00:02:51.000> maybe<00:02:52.000> I'll<00:02:52.209> do<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> few<00:02:52.900> more<00:02:53.080> rows<00:02:55.200> and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
for me maybe I'll do a few more rows and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.270 
for me maybe I'll do a few more rows and
you<00:02:56.290> don't<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.530> have<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> do<00:02:57.010> every<00:02:57.250> single

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you don't know have to do every single

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.090 
you don't know have to do every single
strand<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.570> maybe<00:02:59.020> I'll<00:02:59.170> start<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.650> second

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
strand so maybe I'll start on the second

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.970 
strand so maybe I'll start on the second
one<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:01.989> one<00:03:02.200> I'm<00:03:02.320> just<00:03:02.440> gonna<00:03:02.560> do<00:03:02.800> one

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
one and this one I'm just gonna do one

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.500 
one and this one I'm just gonna do one
handed<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.459> show<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.730> how<00:03:03.880> loose<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.480> can

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
handed to show you how loose you can

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.620 
handed to show you how loose you can
make<00:03:04.810> these<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.360> different

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
make these and it's just a different

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.290 
make these and it's just a different
style<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:08.110> different<00:03:09.150> basically<00:03:10.150> how<00:03:10.270> I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
style it's different basically how I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.500 
style it's different basically how I
make<00:03:10.510> all<00:03:10.660> my<00:03:10.780> shirts<00:03:12.239> some<00:03:13.239> sort<00:03:13.450> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
make all my shirts some sort of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.140 
make all my shirts some sort of
variation<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.560> style<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:18.610> would<00:03:18.970> just

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
variation of this style so I would just

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.449 
variation of this style so I would just
cut<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.019> last<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.620> half<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.160> tie<00:03:21.400> it

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
cut that last one in half and tie it

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.810 
cut that last one in half and tie it
with<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.790> others<00:03:22.030> over<00:03:22.300> here<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.580> may<00:03:24.730> or

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
with the others over here and you may or

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.070 
with the others over here and you may or
may<00:03:24.880> not<00:03:24.940> want<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.300> make<00:03:25.420> too<00:03:25.690> many<00:03:25.870> knots

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
may not want to make too many knots

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.530 
may not want to make too many knots
because<00:03:26.590> they<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.489> get<00:03:27.640> kind<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> bulky<00:03:28.300> at

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
because they do you get kind of bulky at

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.170 
because they do you get kind of bulky at
the<00:03:28.630> sides<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:30.850> looks<00:03:31.000> pretty

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the sides so I think that looks pretty

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.830 
the sides so I think that looks pretty
cool<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:33.130> may<00:03:33.370> or<00:03:33.430> may<00:03:33.550> not<00:03:33.580> like<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.330> lot<00:03:34.690> of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
cool you may or may not like a lot of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.440 
cool you may or may not like a lot of
space<00:03:35.110> here<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.610> make<00:03:36.760> these<00:03:36.910> liens

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
space here so you can make these liens

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.060 
space here so you can make these liens
really<00:03:37.750> small<00:03:38.050> or<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.500> don't<00:03:38.620> even<00:03:38.800> need<00:03:39.010> to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
really small or you don't even need to

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.120 
really small or you don't even need to
have<00:03:39.340> customers<00:03:39.820> rather<00:03:40.060> shirt<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.680> like

yeah<00:04:38.940> here's<00:04:39.940> this<00:04:40.210> shirt<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:40.810> far<00:04:42.030> I'll<00:04:43.030> have

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
yeah here's this shirt so far I'll have

00:04:43.210 --> 00:05:04.230 
yeah here's this shirt so far I'll have
to<00:04:43.330> find<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.690> way<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.530> get<00:04:44.770> these<00:04:44.919> sleeves

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.470 

so<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.660> how<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.930> turned<00:05:06.140> out<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:07.480> think

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
so this is how it turned out I think

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.790 
so this is how it turned out I think
it's<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.810> little<00:05:08.870> better<00:05:09.170> than<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.680> original

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
it's a little better than the original

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.410 
it's a little better than the original
