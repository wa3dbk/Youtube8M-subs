00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
one time that they have such a low body

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
one time that they have such a low body
fat<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.290> see<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.860> muscle<00:02:24.250> I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
fat that you can see all the muscle I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
fat that you can see all the muscle I
mean<00:02:24.910> 145<00:02:25.840> pounders<00:02:26.350> isn't<00:02:26.590> very<00:02:26.770> big<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.400> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
mean 145 pounders isn't very big but I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.610 
mean 145 pounders isn't very big but I
believe<00:02:28.900> Connor

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
believe Connor

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.950 
believe Connor
I<00:02:29.650> mean<00:02:30.610> his<00:02:30.760> walking<00:02:31.270> around<00:02:31.570> weight<00:02:31.810> is

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
I mean his walking around weight is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.470 
I mean his walking around weight is
around<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.380> buck<00:02:32.590> 70<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:33.970> got<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.270> drop

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
around a buck 70 so it's got to drop

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.150 
around a buck 70 so it's got to drop
that<00:02:34.750> way<00:02:34.990> he's<00:02:35.260> got<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.530> slim<00:02:35.740> down<00:02:35.950> her

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
that way he's got to slim down her

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.460 
that way he's got to slim down her
around<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.550> buck<00:02:36.760> 60<00:02:37.210> mark<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:37.840> sweat

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
around the buck 60 mark and then sweat

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.430 
around the buck 60 mark and then sweat
that<00:02:38.680> stuff<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.220> before<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.780> weigh-in<00:02:40.960> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
that stuff out before the weigh-in and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.470 
that stuff out before the weigh-in and
then<00:02:41.650> pack<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.640> weight<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.120> he<00:02:43.150> probably

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
then pack on the weight so he probably

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.030 
then pack on the weight so he probably
weighs<00:02:43.750> about<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:44.110> hundred<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.560> sixty-five

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
weighs about a hundred and sixty-five

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.370 
weighs about a hundred and sixty-five
pounds<00:02:45.340> by<00:02:45.700> fight<00:02:46.000> time<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.510> mean<00:02:47.170> that's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
pounds by fight time I mean that's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.310 
pounds by fight time I mean that's
pretty<00:02:47.590> big<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.100> 145<00:02:48.880> pound<00:02:49.240> realms<00:02:50.110> so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
pretty big in the 145 pound realms so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.200 
pretty big in the 145 pound realms so
when<00:02:50.800> he's<00:02:50.980> dropping<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.550> weight<00:02:51.940> it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
when he's dropping the weight it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.290 
when he's dropping the weight it
definitely<00:02:52.690> looks<00:02:52.870> more<00:02:52.960> cut<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.820> had<00:02:55.270> a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
definitely looks more cut and I had a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
definitely looks more cut and I had a
lot<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.540> fun<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:57.100> the
