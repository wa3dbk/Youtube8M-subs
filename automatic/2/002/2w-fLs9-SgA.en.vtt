00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.240
 hola que tal this time we will make a 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.950
 tutorial renewing the previous version 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.710
 of an animated gif we are going to use a 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.139
 background photo and we will add the text 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.480
 in the corresponding layer and we're going to 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.820
 put the name in this case that 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.690
 group 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.690
 foo fighters 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 and we arrange it with a tool 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 move 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.980
 then we go to the layers window and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.710
 we look around more or less where 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.410
 says opacity on top of the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.040
 100 there as an end there is as a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 hairline and a little triangle and we look for 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.170
 option that says duplicate layer by layer 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.050
 we give it an ok or sometimes in the version 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.750
 cs3 bone c4 simply appears removed 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 the little boy down and here we are going to change him 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.629
 the color of the letter 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.820
 we select and we go to the part 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.989
 superior and in not going to be white is going to 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.439
 be another red color all of a sudden 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.149
 red here and we will continue doing what 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.080
 same we go again here on top of 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:17.970
 opacity up there let's give it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 again the option 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.360
 so that he does not leave the country again there 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 let's make one of three to be 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.800
 see that it is very easy to remove 13 the eye and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 here again I select 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.440
 selected and I will place another 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.440
 I invite my blog again 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.590
 so you can visit jota matos 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.759
 777 point blogspot.com 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.380
 since we have all three and if they want what 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.380
 we put all three eyes 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.000
 come on now we enable the window that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.220
 it's called animation 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.870
 study I have down as I have three 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.290
 colors I will make three layers 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:09.770
 here is the side of the trash can 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.410
 there is a small icon that duplicates one 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 there are the three of us going to the first one in 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.120
 the first one I go to the coat and 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.730
 disabled the first eye 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.950
 uninhabited forgiveness all except the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.750
 first I go to the second 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 I shout the second eye but I remove the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.810
 First 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.770
 I go to the third and in the third I put 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.680
 the last but remove the first 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.530
 each corresponds to its 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 corresponding eye 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 if each one has different ones 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.170
 Now look where it says seconds let's 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.340
 set the time that we are going to put you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.550
 0.2 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 but how can it be different 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.500
 problem is 0 2 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 if we create infinite and we are going to give it a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.409
 click 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.409
 to see what happened 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.270
 change colors 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.700
 right now let's stop it and let's go 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.920
 to save it to publish it as if 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.980
 out an animated gif 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.310
 for this we would have to go to file 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.310
 save for web 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.690
 and here we will give you the option sometimes 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.230
 does not come out jpg we give you a gif option and you 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.230
 we save 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.910
 if we give him save and keep it in my 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.420
 document without desk where better 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.420
 we can 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.700
 placed a man let's put him 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.010
 and I have it saved I give a click 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.010
 right and we open it with the browser 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.459
 fabri with internet explorer 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.819
 and we have our animated gif notice 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.560
 foo fighters this animation we can 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.209
 complement with stars of another color 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.569
 It depends on the layers you want 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:10.590
 stars movement of the texts that 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.099
 it would be your work and thanks to 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.099
 that we are seeing
