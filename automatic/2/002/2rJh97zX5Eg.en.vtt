 just under the October district court 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.560

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.140
 it is not clear what action we were expected 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 what do we want to do these can't about it 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 speak generally the point is that when was 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.700
 a whole year of patrol 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.350

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.840
 also attended both form and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.410
 no doubt, that is, as I understand it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 pps no other classes probably on weekdays 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.900

 and the channel and Marissa 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.760
 let's say what actions will be strong 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 parties in general that I can say everything 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.200
 our actions within the legal framework 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.729
 no acting action 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.330
 Russian Federation legislation we do not 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.130
 breaking 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.159
 and we are not going to do it the other way around 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.650
 only fight it also also very 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.119
 unpleasant fact now I want you 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.100

 Samara city is not clear at all 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.110
 where did they find the extremism of my actions 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.369
 where did they find extremism 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.649
 channel footage 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.050
 Amaryllis is unclear about the general essence of what 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.119
 invited me to chat means 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.670
 perhaps we talked to this meeting 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.370
 just because I say so there 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.500
 asked 1 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.580
 man from behind the scenes running here they would 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.569
 call who's there for chance don't have it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.939
 dislike it adequate enough 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.799
 man hundreds in this very come on 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.909
 this meeting the meeting took place immediately 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:23.090
 after the middle meeting that there was 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.870
 means means operative bar 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.370
 kursk alexander alexandrovich spent 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.230
 Colonel so I understand the doctor 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.969
 head of the department to combat 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.739
 extremism 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.810
 colonel's name I wo n't say one thing 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.370
 that name is Anton there too as he orphaned 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.569
 My name is Anton Your name is Andrei Yes 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.769
 this is over and 45th that never passed 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.219
 mtk there 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.709
 more simple and easy that's what the point is 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.780
 how pretty everything was at first politely 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.750
 and culturally we talked talked 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.139
 easy though I donâ€™t understand honestly why 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.909
 at all 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.120
 and with the department to combat extremism 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.189
 and how would I personal what was this done 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.069
 not very clear the essence of what caused 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.019
 I say so very popular I will say simple 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.549
 words for not following popular then 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.949
 that channel and Marissa 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.750
 can't exist anymore 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.090
 activity channel must be 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.430
 terminated terminated it should be 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.579
 just a circle saying even instantly given 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.579
 time till evening channel must be removed 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.040
 the name mr forest should also be 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:31.310
 erased roughly say so from the face and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.590
 the Internet from the face of youtube so that it does not 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.659
 it was as if nothing and everyone had forgotten 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 despite the fact that the material on this 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.689
 channel laid out since 2011 this 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.650
 channel 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.680
 shows real 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.439
 real road is all that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.040
 what kind of inspectors do we have? 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.829
 dps 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.019
 there is a normal whole 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.420
 undisciplined all this as if without 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.250
 any lie without any there 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.379
 performed either fanaticism again without 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.010
 any there with you either hate 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.049
 no absolutely no really very 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.450
 unpleasant to observe such a picture 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.010
 what is the counterterrorism department 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
 here is the topic of interest 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.659
 more often the fight against extremism and not 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.109
 traffic police and about it 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.870
 I can't understand now 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.910
 if they saw some this video could 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.220
 materials there or such actions there 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.600
 me there or ten of my comrades 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.000
 some kind of extremism 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.020
 so please let's understand 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.600
 framework of legal field 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.030
 called on the agenda collect 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.570
 the stuff here is not that very thing i 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.460
 I want to say I decided to give it our all 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.789
 general review tell you this 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.139
 situation this problem because 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.889
 there is a real persecution here 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.319
 to this day today we have today 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.400
 well 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:58.810
 today we have February 10, 2015 here 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.879
 time somewhere 2300 what can I say by 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.340
 this day from the fifth day the most 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.550
 real repression my address is somehow 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.499
 punch their pages there some 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.620
 help offer incomprehensible personality 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:13.749
 the wedding on this page one afternoon there 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.969
 clearly generally such nonsense just weave 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.439
 also punch through my friends 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:22.419
 close so on so on so on 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:25.180
 Here the situation is extremely unpleasant to expect from 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.860
 They can be just anything, I think so 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.830
 I suppose that 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.599
 swallow let's say flew by 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.159
 manual hippo dd samara region 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.500
 because who else can 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.719
 I'm so interested so time 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.870
 happened we went on the right 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:43.020
 ways we go the right way by 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.069
 expose so to speak 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.370
 undisciplined dps officers 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:51.520
 but the most basic thing I want to say 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.889
 no prizes no pickets timbal 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.319

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.539
 there can be no country 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.180
 because we fully support 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.500
 acting power and us completely 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.060
 it suits me that my comrades 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.229
 we fully support Vladimir 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.320

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.570
 parties did not happen happen not 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.000

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.380

 accessories of these people
