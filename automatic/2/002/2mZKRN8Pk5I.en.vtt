00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.240
 boxee the hercules dj control instincts 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.040
 that's my first video and shows you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 Today just a controller dare 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.380
 from a review will follow 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 and I also try a video about it 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.810
 Doing it all up 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.630
 English I can not show you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.970
 promise if that really comes when 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 just learned English and then 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 let's start now as we see 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.960
 The whole packaging is in English 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.899
 presents action so speak the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.600
 jockeys only go when you get on it 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.399
 By the way, I'm pushing now 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.719
 with the beginning of the games 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.149
 I opted for this device has the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:04.260
 90 euro costs at Amazon 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:01:07.439
 it has two decks 13 preview stereo 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.119
 output mix from behind goes to the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.820
 Speakers to the boxes I know that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.200
 and it works on mac and windows it is 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.240
 usb2 and usb 3 compatible 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.850
 All this comes with the software used 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 the backside thing weighs on everyone 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 already more than a few other cartons 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.479
 In this size here we will be the top 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.909
 so york from above the look of it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.299
 the side or from behind and see here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 we stop how to connect it and here 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.060
 we also see some german 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.240
 inscriptions in french 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.409
 Portuguese and so on and there 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.070
 Let's take the packaging the same 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:00.049
 even apart is already doing so 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.049
 turn around and catch up 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.350
 and right around 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.970
 It may be that you make me fit the steps 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.340
 Power is everything with my camera 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.240
 we have the good , it is relatively small 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.700
 at first glance, it begins as a layman 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.700
 often omitted 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:51.700
 Here we have courageous drinks 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:57.340
 sip energy hacker attack league 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.720
 is user manual with cd what we are 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.840
 directly noticeable when I get the thing here 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.560
 want to push away it has beautiful 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.850
 coating on it naturally 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:11.110
 slips away really small so a work 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.700
 is as big as a palm what you want 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.770
 must say directly to the nicely coated 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.200
 So here with krutsch not so easy 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.200
 not all right well 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.880
 here we have crossfader also relative 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.350
 good to use so you can tell that there 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.959
 no preset in it or something 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.540
 So you have to do everything yourself 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.970
 we have we the leinfelder are already 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.610
 a little harder to use yourself too 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.980
 good because the principle can be that little bit 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.970
 mix as well as you can we the pitch 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.940
 adjust the speed 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.930
 avoided rome below car sinks functions 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.519
 and so clint hocking we can yes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.489
 also knows here can us effects 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:02.050
 drauflegen luke comes to the example here 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.920
 it the choreographer whole thing yes me 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.850
 believe that will be here in the first place that 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.800
 even here you can band the already 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.550
 you can here 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.360
 choose the song on the pc in the folder 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:22.370
 go find new song and pick it up 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:25.380
 Becker or baby on it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.350
 Here we can adjust the volume to the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.550
 change headphones 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.460
 we can not rest with peace 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.840
 Here we have the us again 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.660
 a corner openly said here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.660
 It is also possible to control 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.860
 because I think you do not notice it that way 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.830
 that there what you have to absorb pressure 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:52.110
 although here we can sit down 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:54.510
 instead of suspecting and holding your state one 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.010
 the song what, of course, I stay here 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:08.850
 From the journey we see the headphones 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:18.590
 Input is normal jack fits therefore 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:23.160
 perfect so normal jack demand 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.970
 why here we have the normal ones 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:31.110
 clinch video inputs audio inputs white 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.100
 red what we should know for the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.410
 speaker boxes 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.740
 that was me all out of the controller 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.450
 So wrestled pretty and come now 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.450
 We used precondition 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.410
 It is my first video 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:06:13.740
 namely good so therefore we have the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:16.380
