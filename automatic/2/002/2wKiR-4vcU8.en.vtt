 the construction of the horse's training 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.170
 No matter how the goal of horse training 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.350
 looks like a reliable recreational horse 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.600
 patres origins or western drives 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.000
 previously created concept is the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.159
 key to success should that be 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.289
 learning and working pace always on the

 physical and mental development 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.929
 be tailored 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.409
 but how long can it take to get there? 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.770
 set goals are a good tool 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.750
 to be for horse and person and to one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.479
 better communication of the two for 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.460
 the work with the double long is only 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.680
 increasingly popular in recent years 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.540

 greatest possible domestication and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.390
 strengthening the musculature of the horse 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.400
 the ride and can thus a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.200
 meaningful addition to the training 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.860
 represent each horse 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.930
 the double work has the potential 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.510
 leaning on tact space handle and bend 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.730
 as well as condition and muscle development too 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.650
 improve without the horse's back 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.650
 burdened by the rider weight
