00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:11.420
 I thank the god that was for me 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.440
 undefeated loves 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.660
 I am the master of my destiny 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.430
 I am the captain my soul today takes possession 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.290
 the president send it in pretoria 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 must balance the aspirations of 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.300
 the blacks with the fears of the plans 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.320
 this day's probe is the day that our 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.320
 country went to hell 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.180
 brothers brothers it's time to 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:45.670
 build our nation 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.670
 Whites support South Africa 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.630
 when is the world cup the emotions 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.930
 too much they are a real disaster 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.390
 I have been invited to take the day and the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 president lives franÃ§ois how can we 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.309
 dream of something great when not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.470
 we have nothing to dream about how to do 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.470
 dream to everyone around us 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.630
 what did he want 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.740
 I think he wants us to win the cup of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.020
 world 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.020
 then rugby is a maneuver 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 politics is a human maneuver 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.030
 according to the experts we will not go beyond 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.000
 quarter finals 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.350
 according to the experts you and I should 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 continue on the street 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 the times change 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 and we have to change 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.990
 we have become much more than a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.869
 team of the same 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.079
 have you ever imagined something like the 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.079
 empty 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.900
 is not listening to your country is now or 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.430
 never 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.430
 this is our destiny 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.970
 I was thinking how he could have passed 30 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.380
 years in a tiny cell and then 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.380
 go out and forgive those who locked him 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.640
 I am fashion 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.600
 but instead
