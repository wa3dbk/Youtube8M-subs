00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.600
 I would like to focus on it 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.090
 want and that is what I myself 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.080
 make and try I succeed too 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 not always when we have a new better one 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.420
 I want to start with world 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
 to be interested in it for the first time 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.480
 and organize accordingly and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.740
 then prepare in my family in 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.250
 my friends in my direct 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.349
 environment exactly where I live what I am 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.030
 also as home would designate 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.649
 that is exactly what the in the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 globalized world they have done 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.000
 have stolen the people 's homeland 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.600
 and also the feeling for it and in one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.340
 global world just a global one 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 mass of consumers and of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.719
 created by producers 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 we are consumer manufacturers we 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.010
 live in an economy we live in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.690
 Parking management everywhere 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 is the interest profit is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 to do something and that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 human beings are human beings 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 and to take them only as a matter 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.790
 treat and see and who is on it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.350
 einsteigt 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 and who joins this game and that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.520
 starts in front of court where the call it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 is called in things mayer against 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.770
 Schulze and the person in the matter 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.290
 getting up has lost well 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 but if something is robbed us then 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.930
 we can also argue verbally 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.140
 that we needed it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.350
 that's right, so to speak, not not 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.740
 which we think we have stolen something 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.780
 as as hostile or ruling 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.729
 but if we want to start ourselves and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.509
 to raise yourself 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 then we are the ones who have us 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.530
 cut or have brought 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.439
 it is also us who we are here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 harass each other 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.960
 because if I get my thing so 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 I always say in a lot of ways 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.890
 my lectures the system we are 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.470
 because every day we have the offers from the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.850
 take the course as knitted him 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.680
 have that under the line not 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.180
 For us that is favorable to us 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.220
 also not achieved and the way into the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.750
 Freedom is also not placarded 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480
 you have to conquer yourself in the right way 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 not from scratch, we start 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.640
 are born as human beings and still 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.130
 before we scream our first or 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.660
 meanwhile it sounds like he's doing it 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.980
 we have ever been within this system 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.360
 been sold 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.310
 because ยง 10 the introductory law to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.170
 civil law is right on 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.780
 the name of a natural person has the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.970
 State where he has no computer 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.330
 in my own name 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.670
 I have a partner on a lecture 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.890
 they had a smart one 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.050
 question asked the question were the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.709
 the pope hessen his people in the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.920
 Francis the former Benedict how 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.769
 is called the queen and all elisabeth like 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.290
 then is our former Kaiser wilhelm 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.989
 and now please add the last names and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.340
 then there was silence in the woods 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.610
 and then you will be another if 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.610
 one went on, how are they ? 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.130
 her name came 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.049
 benedict the man is called 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.810
 civil name and in the register 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.500
 enlisted joseph ratzinger who has 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.390
 giving them the name 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.019
 who was himself that was the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.709
 incarnation 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.079
 It's that easy to see it alone 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.200
 the laws so on the topic 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.299
 come back Incarnation it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.769
 is up to me and I have to look what 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.380
 they did and they have me 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.670
 Treats and wears the system is 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.290
 I'm not going anywhere a 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.250
 Registration in the Middle Ages 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.380
 invented 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.420
 then they tore off the deep form of 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.950
 So rex of the king is almost with 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.769
 I associate with the property transfer 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.600
 just in any case my name and 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.730
 the name I get as natural 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310
 person, he is only the one by this 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.650
 seems that's the person that yes 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.510
 not the human and there is one 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.190
 philosophical or spiritual question 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.720
 behind it, I have a body 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.200
 or am I the body and the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.850
 try us permanently in the k 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.850
 to drive and that we ourselves 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.770
 confess exclusively to the bodies 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.700
 because only against the body we 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.380
 they can also do something 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.060
 Freedom deprivation water is added 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.680
 uncomfortable if you go against the body 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.750
 what does he do ? 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.040
 But behind it, man is not the one 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.350
 The body against people can 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.640
 principally do and will not do anything 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.890
 There is no way to do that 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.240
 human rights and I always maintain 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.520
 Human rights are on the world 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.860
 respected 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.690
 everywhere for people the question is 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.760
 I think of one and most about it 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.830
 people are not natural at all 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.860
 the biologically indisputable people 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.510
 are you in the legal understanding of the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.420
 People who give us this system 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.240
 have imposed human nee there's 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.580
 the trick there are legally so a few 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.840
 things that we did not notice 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.120
 where we volunteer, so to speak 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.830
 have passed the slavery and if 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.810
 one looks at state structures 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.070
 who is the state where is the start there 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.290
 it 's still like that at all 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.970
 laws then we have more and more 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.310
 determined and that will probably be synonymous 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.140
 can not change like the real one 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.520
 sovereignty or who the first and 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.760
 Finally, the last state 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.860
 structure that exists and that again 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.110
 Growing up is really complete 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.660
 down the commune and what the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.040
 People decide there 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.620
 and you can get in pretty fast 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.650
 high functions and what they do 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.240
 Of course, they are like one 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.280
 matryoshka visio russian matryoshka 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.880
 one cover after the other over packed 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.260
 and these are just administrative constructs 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.680
 administrative units under private law 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.140
 nature to the european union in 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.450
 Brussels and the Lisbon Treaty 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.080
 clearly no international treaty 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.850
 but a private contract 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.190
 and if I pass with one now 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.810
 run around the one red dependent and there 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.190
 is the first to be similar to the Federal Republic 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.660
 germany over it but first 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.820
 there is european union 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.110
 and then I have in the document too 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.060
 I'm still signed so I'm one 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.160
 contracted so to speak 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.960
 underlined the acceptance of the 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.320
 lisbon-contract that I am the 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.490
 subjected 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.870
 and if we do not want that anymore then 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.070
 we must first of matroschka of 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.830
 outside play everywhere 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.150
 what is there so round that away 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.740
 lisbon then comes in here somewhere 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.120
 the basic law appears in us 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.900
 I chile that away then what comes next 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.340
 to the fore 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.990
 the Weimar constitution comes to life 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.700
 I do not want that either 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.530
 have occupying construct comes because 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.930
 then to the appearance of the constitution 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.570
 of 18 71 or the country constitutions 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.400
 of the individual states that we 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.290
 here was the weimar constitution 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.750
 have ever been demoted to countries 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.460
 etc at his dictation and and 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.590
 I do not agree but we 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.490
 then always come to the heart of things and 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.800
 to the core at the end you stand something yourself 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.020
 man and now you see yourself as 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.700
 human being is considered as a human being 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.220
 one the others as such 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.160
 and if we are a human 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.510
 society then we should 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.510
 First of all, people behave themselves
