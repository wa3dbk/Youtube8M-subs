00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.460 
minute on the left hand those exercises
are<00:02:17.090> extremely<00:02:18.090> important<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.320> do

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
are extremely important you have to do

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.860 
are extremely important you have to do
that<00:02:19.650> every<00:02:20.040> single<00:02:20.070> day<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.910> order<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.690> your

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that every single day in order for your

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.170 
that every single day in order for your
muscles<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.500> memorize<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.370> correct<00:02:23.640> motions

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
muscles to memorize the correct motions

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.870 
muscles to memorize the correct motions
now<00:02:24.840> let's<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> new<00:02:25.440> exercise<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.640> one

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
now let's do a new exercise this one

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180 
now let's do a new exercise this one
will<00:02:27.060> work<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.510> double<00:02:28.050> strokes<00:02:28.380> we've<00:02:28.980> done

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
will work on double strokes we've done

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.770 
will work on double strokes we've done
the<00:02:29.340> double<00:02:29.459> stroke<00:02:29.790> roll<00:02:29.820> where<00:02:30.600> we're<00:02:30.750> using

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the double stroke roll where we're using

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.540 
the double stroke roll where we're using
our<00:02:31.110> sticks<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> hand<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> going

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
our sticks in a hand this one is going

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.240 
our sticks in a hand this one is going
to<00:02:32.610> work<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:33.200> strengthening<00:02:34.200> our<00:02:34.560> wrist

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to work on strengthening our wrist

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.520 
to work on strengthening our wrist
muscles<00:02:35.959> so<00:02:36.959> we're<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.410> this

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
muscles so we're going to do this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
muscles so we're going to do this
without<00:02:37.709> our<00:02:38.250> sticks<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.790> our<00:02:38.820> hands<00:02:39.270> lay<00:02:39.570> your

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
without our sticks in our hands lay your

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.020 
without our sticks in our hands lay your
hand<00:02:39.990> across<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.830> leg<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.790> play

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
hand across your leg and just play

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.890 
hand across your leg and just play
double<00:02:42.480> strokes<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.680> hand<00:02:45.980> as

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
double strokes on just the right hand as

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.300 
double strokes on just the right hand as
loud<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.230> possible<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:52.680> my<00:02:52.800> students<00:02:53.190> do

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
loud as possible I have my students do

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.220 
loud as possible I have my students do
this<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.610> loud<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.120> possible<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this as loud as possible because it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.890 
this as loud as possible because it
forces<00:02:55.590> them<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.160> use<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> full<00:02:56.910> wrist<00:02:57.360> stroke<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
forces them to use a full wrist stroke a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.110 
forces them to use a full wrist stroke a
