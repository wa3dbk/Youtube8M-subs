00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:10.170
We look for peace and joy and fulfillment
in many things in life but the only one who

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.180
can satisfy our soul is Jesus Christ.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.240
We read in John 4:9 about a Samaritan woman.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.999
Jesus asked her for a drink of water.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:34.360
“The Samaritan woman therefore said to Him,
“How is it that You, being a Jew, ask me

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.130
for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman?”

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.500
(For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.080
10Jesus answered and said to her, “If you
knew the gift of God, and who it is who says

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.520
to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have
asked Him, and HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU LIVING

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
WATER.”

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.470
11She said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing
to draw with and the well is deep; where then

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.879
do You get that living water?

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.140
12“ You are not greater than our father
Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.560
drank of it himself, and his sons, and his
cattle?”

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.900
13Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone
who drinks of this water shall thirst again;

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.670
14but whoever drinks of the water that I shall
give him shall never thirst; but THE WATER

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:42.120
THAT I SHALL GIVE HIM SHALL BECOME IN HIM
A WELL OF WATER SPRINGING UP TO ETERNAL LIFE.”

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:52.810
That water, that LIVING WATER is still available,
only from Jesus and it will become in you

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.770
a well of living water that springs up into
eternal life.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.950
This was a sinful woman, she had five husbands
but Jesus offered her LIVING WATER.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.680
None of us is deserving of the love of God.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.819
None of us is deserving of the living water
that Jesus offers us.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.310
All He says is:”Come to Me and I will give
you that LIVING WATER.”

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.760
If you are thirsty and dry, if you are thirsty
enough, if you have tried everything and your

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.040
life is a mess, it is time to go to Jesus
for the LIVING WATER.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.310
Fall down on your knees before Him and say:”Lord,
give me that LIVING WATER.”

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.840
It will become in you a well that springs
up into eternal life and if you want to have

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.200
that living water and always drink of it,
then STAY WITH JESUS.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.459
Turn away from everything else, all those
dry wells where you you have been, where you

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.480
have been looking for peace and joy and happiness,
and where you were disappointed, because Jesus,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.740
ONLY JESUS CAN GIVE YOU LIVING WATER.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.940
Are you thirsty and dry?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.019
Then it is time to go to Jesus.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.260
Fall on your knees, cry out to Him.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.120
Say:”Lord, give me that LIVING WATER,”
and He will give you of that LIVING WATER.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.239
If you are not thirsty enough, if you are
not dry enough, FAST and PRAY and SEEK Him

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.879
and He will FILL YOU with the LIVING WATER!

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.459
May Jesus Bless you.
