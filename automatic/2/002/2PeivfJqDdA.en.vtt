smoke<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> mirrors<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.799> shows<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
smoke and mirrors I think it shows that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.469 
smoke and mirrors I think it shows that
the<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:53.040> fact<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> use

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the the fact is that you want to use

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.069 
the the fact is that you want to use
this<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> technology<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:56.960> obtain<00:01:57.960> an
