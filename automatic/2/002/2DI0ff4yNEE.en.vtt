cybertron several keepers would remove
one<00:05:43.150> spark<00:05:43.810> from<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.199> Allspark<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.130> place<00:05:45.849> it

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
one spark from the Allspark and place it

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.600 
one spark from the Allspark and place it
into<00:05:46.419> a<00:05:46.780> spark<00:05:47.199> housing<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:48.099> make<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:48.310> new

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
into a spark housing to make a new

Cybertronian<00:05:49.449> I<00:05:49.690> see<00:05:50.560> doctor<00:05:50.949> so<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.060> reverse

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
Cybertronian I see doctor so the reverse

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.260 
Cybertronian I see doctor so the reverse
theoretically<00:05:53.889> would<00:05:54.159> be<00:05:54.340> possible<00:05:54.849> as<00:05:55.030> well

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
theoretically would be possible as well

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.219 
theoretically would be possible as well
I<00:05:55.539> could<00:05:56.260> use<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:56.500> Allspark<00:05:57.280> shard<00:05:57.699> as<00:05:58.030> a

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
I could use the Allspark shard as a

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.060 
I could use the Allspark shard as a
temporary<00:05:59.229> vessel<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.789> house<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.360> sparks

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
temporary vessel to house of sparks

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.610 
temporary vessel to house of sparks
until<00:06:03.070> I<00:06:03.099> remove<00:06:03.729> them<00:06:04.180> and<00:06:04.419> place<00:06:05.110> them<00:06:05.139> into

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
until I remove them and place them into

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.550 
until I remove them and place them into
hatchlings<00:06:06.340> or<00:06:06.780> until<00:06:07.780> we<00:06:07.810> made<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.110> larger
