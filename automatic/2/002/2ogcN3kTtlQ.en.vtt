is to collect as many cacti as possible
within<00:02:13.529> 60<00:02:14.519> seconds

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
within 60 seconds

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.750 
within 60 seconds
and<00:02:16.489> dieters<00:02:17.489> made<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.329> lovely

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and dieters made this this nice lovely

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.149 
and dieters made this this nice lovely
trapdoor<00:02:20.760> kind<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.209> thing

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
trapdoor kind of thing

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.739 
trapdoor kind of thing
what<00:02:23.159> is<00:02:23.249> lever<00:02:23.400> where<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.239> can<00:02:24.359> activate<00:02:24.689> it

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
what is lever where you can activate it

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.390 
what is lever where you can activate it
and<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.409> as<00:02:25.590> soon<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:25.889> activated

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and you know as soon as you activated

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.030 
and you know as soon as you activated
the<00:02:26.459> minute<00:02:26.670> starts<00:02:26.999> and<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.930> guess<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:28.889> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the minute starts and I guess we have to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.699 
the minute starts and I guess we have to
have<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.639> do<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.629> know<00:02:30.719> the<00:02:31.109> old-fashioned

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
have to do it you know the old-fashioned

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.649 
have to do it you know the old-fashioned
way<00:02:31.859> with<00:02:31.889> a<00:02:32.099> stopwatch<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.969> but<00:02:33.389> first

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
way with a stopwatch and so on but first

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.470 
way with a stopwatch and so on but first
before<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.680> show<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.310> how<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.359> works

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
before we show you how that works

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.129 
before we show you how that works
exactly

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
exactly

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.009 
exactly
maybe<00:02:38.060> dieter<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.209> show<00:02:39.329> us<00:02:39.480> around<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.989> little

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
maybe dieter can show us around a little

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.339 
maybe dieter can show us around a little
bit<00:02:40.379> around<00:02:41.159> this<00:02:41.370> nice<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.359> contraption

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
bit around this nice little contraption

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.489 
bit around this nice little contraption
of<00:02:43.439> ease<00:02:43.590> okay<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:45.180> will<00:02:45.419> explain<00:02:45.780> how<00:02:46.469> I

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:46.499 
of ease okay I will explain how I

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.879 
of ease okay I will explain how I
started<00:02:47.189> with<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.959> first<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.109> make<00:02:49.319> the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
started with this first I make the

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.809 
started with this first I make the
foundation<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.669> the<00:02:51.150> cactus<00:02:51.650> collector<00:02:52.819> just

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
foundation of the cactus collector just

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.699 
foundation of the cactus collector just
doing<00:02:54.150> by<00:02:54.299> we<00:02:54.510> were<00:02:54.629> building<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.139> spiral<00:02:55.560> out

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
doing by we were building a spiral out

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.879 
doing by we were building a spiral out
of<00:02:55.739> wool<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.329> in<00:02:57.329> each<00:02:57.480> four<00:02:58.409> corners<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.859> put

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
of wool and in each four corners I put

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.240 
of wool and in each four corners I put
water<00:02:59.299> that<00:03:00.299> takes<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:01.109> what<00:03:01.620> falls<00:03:02.010> into

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
water that takes all what falls into

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.979 
water that takes all what falls into
this<00:03:02.609> collection<00:03:02.849> point<00:03:03.299> yeah<00:03:03.629> in<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> middle

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
this collection point yeah in the middle

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.759 
this collection point yeah in the middle
you<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.290> see<00:03:04.609> who<00:03:05.609> is<00:03:05.969> going<00:03:06.299> very<00:03:06.750> good<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
you can see who is going very good and

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.159 
you can see who is going very good and
then<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.879> same<00:03:08.909> at<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.810> standard

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
then it's the same at the standard

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.670 
then it's the same at the standard
position<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:11.099> build<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.400> cactus<00:03:11.669> form<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.150> take

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
position to build a cactus form you take

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.289 
position to build a cactus form you take
some<00:03:13.680> block<00:03:13.949> and<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.219> put<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.579> sand<00:03:14.909> so<00:03:15.150> it's

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
some block and you put on sand so it's

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.860 
some block and you put on sand so it's
stopped<00:03:15.900> from<00:03:16.620> dropping<00:03:17.099> down<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.389> put

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
stopped from dropping down then you put

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.629 
stopped from dropping down then you put
a<00:03:18.900> torch<00:03:19.199> on<00:03:19.409> it<00:03:19.469> so<00:03:20.479> yeah<00:03:21.479> it<00:03:22.199> makes<00:03:22.560> light<00:03:23.430> so

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
a torch on it so yeah it makes light so

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.009 
a torch on it so yeah it makes light so
that<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.790> cactus<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.239> grow<00:03:24.449> and<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.810> cactus

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
that the cactus can grow and a cactus

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.009 
that the cactus can grow and a cactus
can<00:03:25.349> grow<00:03:25.560> three<00:03:26.009> blocks<00:03:26.280> up<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.900> are

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
can grow three blocks up but there are

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.199 
can grow three blocks up but there are
left<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.590> right<00:03:28.799> block<00:03:29.519> who<00:03:29.699> stopping<00:03:30.090> that

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
left and right block who stopping that

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.319 
left and right block who stopping that
so<00:03:31.049> they<00:03:31.169> can<00:03:31.349> grow<00:03:31.590> only<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.759> layer<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
so they can grow only this layer and

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.119 
so they can grow only this layer and
then<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.689> drop<00:03:33.930> off<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.379> it's<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.040> way

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
then that drop off and it's all the way

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.629 
then that drop off and it's all the way
to<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.370> top<00:03:35.639> that's<00:03:36.180> how<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.720> works<00:03:36.989> okay<00:03:37.979> so

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
to the top that's how it works okay so

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.670 
to the top that's how it works okay so
when<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.389> basically<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:40.019> cuts<00:03:40.259> it<00:03:40.349> off<00:03:40.439> and

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
when it it basically it cuts it off and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.219 
when it it basically it cuts it off and
then<00:03:40.769> falls<00:03:41.040> down<00:03:41.129> into<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.549> water<00:03:41.759> and<00:03:45.229> yeah

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
then falls down into the water and yeah

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.289 
then falls down into the water and yeah
great<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:46.799> really<00:03:46.979> amazed<00:03:47.430> actually<00:03:47.909> by<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
great I'm really amazed actually by this

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.780 
great I'm really amazed actually by this
this<00:03:48.659> thing<00:03:49.229> I<00:03:49.709> didn't<00:03:50.159> really<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.639> it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
this thing I didn't really know it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.999 
this thing I didn't really know it
before<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.209> saw<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.840> today<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.290> yeah<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.859> think

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
before I saw it today and yeah I think

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:57.050 
before I saw it today and yeah I think
it<00:03:53.159> was<00:03:53.250> great<00:03:54.889> yeah<00:03:55.889> you<00:03:56.519> know<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.639> think<00:03:56.879> we

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it was great yeah you know I think we

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.240 
it was great yeah you know I think we
should<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.329> go<00:03:57.509> we<00:03:58.079> fried<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.739> couple

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
should have a go we fried it a couple

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.429 
should have a go we fried it a couple
times<00:03:59.400> before<00:03:59.689> to<00:04:00.689> see<00:04:00.840> how<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.019> works<00:04:01.229> and

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
times before to see how it works and

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.379 
times before to see how it works and
it's<00:04:01.709> pretty<00:04:01.889> consistent<00:04:02.069> in<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.790> amount<00:04:03.030> so

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
it's pretty consistent in the amount so

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.849 
it's pretty consistent in the amount so
yeah<00:04:04.199> I'm<00:04:04.530> pretty<00:04:04.650> glad<00:04:04.949> for<00:04:05.189> that<00:04:05.269> I<00:04:06.269> guess<00:04:06.959> we

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
yeah I'm pretty glad for that I guess we

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.770 
yeah I'm pretty glad for that I guess we
should<00:04:07.979> have<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.129> go<00:04:08.310> let's<00:04:08.969> let<00:04:09.299> me<00:04:09.389> drop<00:04:09.599> this

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
should have a go let's let me drop this

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.479 
should have a go let's let me drop this
with<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.139> one<00:04:10.349> because<00:04:10.829> otherwise<00:04:11.129> you're

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
with this one because otherwise you're

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.990

lower than we've had before so maybe

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.630 
lower than we've had before so maybe
it's<00:06:11.730> not<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.880> record<00:06:12.090> for<00:06:12.300> us<00:06:12.390> but<00:06:12.630> you<00:06:13.500> know<00:06:13.640> if

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
it's not a record for us but you know if

it's not a record for us but you know if
you<00:06:14.820> think<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.270> can<00:06:15.420> break<00:06:15.600> this<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:17.400> know

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
you think you can break this you know

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.860 
you think you can break this you know
try<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.830> send<00:06:19.830> us<00:06:19.920> a<00:06:20.040> video<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.780> know

try it and send us a video and you know

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.010 
try it and send us a video and you know
hopefully<00:06:23.000> it's<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.150> record<00:06:24.420> so<00:06:24.540> you<00:06:24.600> know<00:06:24.930> we

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
can put a record sign here and then you

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.780 
can put a record sign here and then you
know<00:06:27.180> keep<00:06:27.360> updating<00:06:28.140> it's<00:06:28.290> the<00:06:28.560> -<00:06:29.040> so<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.610> says

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
know keep updating it's the - so it says
