snowboards<00:01:39.340> back<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.890> great<00:01:42.039> how<00:01:42.160> many

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
snowboards back in it's great how many

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.029 
snowboards back in it's great how many
they<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:42.910> something<00:01:43.330> like<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.660> just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
basically put the screw on a bit of

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.999 
basically put the screw on a bit of
paper<00:01:46.270> with<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> little<00:01:47.229> note<00:01:47.410> for<00:01:47.740> where<00:01:47.920> it

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
paper with a little note for where it

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.070 
paper with a little note for where it
goes<00:01:48.160> you<00:01:48.490> probably<00:01:49.330> all<00:01:49.479> needed<00:01:49.780> for<00:01:49.960> this

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
goes you probably all needed for this

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.960 
goes you probably all needed for this
particular<00:01:50.350> task<00:01:50.740> but<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.399> always<00:01:51.580> helps

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
particular task but it it always helps

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
particular task but it it always helps
to<00:01:52.030> make<00:01:52.240> sure<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.509> know<00:01:52.630> where<00:01:52.780> everything

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
to make sure you know where everything

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.400 
to make sure you know where everything
goes<00:01:53.229> back<00:01:54.479> okay<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:55.539> once<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.840> door<00:01:56.080> cards

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
goes back okay so once the door cards

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.859 
goes back okay so once the door cards
off<00:01:56.910> it's<00:01:57.910> pretty<00:01:58.000> much<00:01:58.270> what<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.539> looks<00:01:58.690> like

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
off it's pretty much what it looks like

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.590 
off it's pretty much what it looks like
using<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> air<00:01:59.649> back<00:01:59.890> there<00:02:00.600> when

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
using this in the air back there when

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.499 
using this in the air back there when
you<00:02:01.690> do<00:02:01.780> remove<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.759> black<00:02:03.759> padding<00:02:04.149> panel

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
you do remove the black padding panel

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.200 
you do remove the black padding panel
and<00:02:04.750> remove<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.740> air<00:02:06.009> bag<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.670> get<00:02:06.820> access<00:02:07.179> to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
and remove the air bag to get access to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.710 
and remove the air bag to get access to
the<00:02:07.420> regulator<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:10.060> we'll<00:02:10.209> start<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.630> now

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the regulator so we'll start on that now

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.449 
the regulator so we'll start on that now
before<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.320> remove<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.860> airbag<00:02:12.190> we'll

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.090 
that but looks like it's just completely
snapped<00:02:43.010> off<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:48.320> we'll<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> regulator

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
snapped off so we'll get the regulator

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.870 
snapped off so we'll get the regulator
out<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.120> we'll<00:02:50.240> have<00:02:50.360> another<00:02:50.540> look<00:02:50.690> at<00:02:50.750> it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
out and we'll have another look at it

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.160 
out and we'll have another look at it
it's<00:02:52.880> videos<00:02:53.240> just<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> know<00:02:53.750> how<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.930> all

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
it's videos just so I know how it all

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's videos just so I know how it all
goes<00:02:54.320> back<00:02:54.380> together<00:02:54.770> pretty<00:02:55.310> good<00:02:55.550> look<00:02:55.730> at

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
goes back together pretty good look at

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:23.020 
goes back together pretty good look at
it<00:02:55.970> four<00:02:56.900> take<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.290> apart<00:03:21.100> okay<00:03:22.130> those<00:03:22.700> three

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it four take it apart okay those three

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:52.750 
it four take it apart okay those three
bolts<00:03:24.400> need<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.490> cool<00:03:25.700> off<00:03:51.490> okay<00:03:52.490> so<00:03:52.550> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
bolts need to cool off okay so the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.340 
bolts need to cool off okay so the
regulator<00:03:53.210> is<00:03:53.450> out<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.780> car<00:03:53.960> now<00:03:54.140> that's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
regulator is out of the car now that's

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:04.650 
regulator is out of the car now that's
going<00:03:54.500> on<00:03:54.590> look<00:03:54.800> at<00:03:54.860> it<00:04:00.700> as<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.060> see

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
of the wire which feeds down there it's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.860 
of the wire which feeds down there it's
completely<00:04:10.819> stopped<00:04:11.120> off<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.540> supposed

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
completely stopped off that's supposed

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.090 
completely stopped off that's supposed
to<00:04:11.959> go<00:04:12.470> down<00:04:12.680> there<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.130> you'll<00:04:13.880> be<00:04:14.030> there

welcome Carmen so we'll put a new

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.550 
welcome Carmen so we'll put a new
