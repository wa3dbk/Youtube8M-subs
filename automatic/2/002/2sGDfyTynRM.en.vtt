00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
people but let's face it the reason why

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
people but let's face it the reason why
we<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.420> we're<00:00:18.720> made<00:00:19.470> by<00:00:19.650> supernatural

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we think we're made by supernatural

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.250 
we think we're made by supernatural
being<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:21.050> compared<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.140> other

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
being is because compared to other

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.390 
being is because compared to other
animals<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.400> earth<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.600> planet

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
animals on this earth this planet

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.660 
animals on this earth this planet
because<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.910> humans<00:00:27.300> names<00:00:27.570> planet<00:00:28.050> Earth

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
because we humans names planet Earth

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.350 
because we humans names planet Earth
anyways<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:31.109> we're<00:00:31.380> uh<00:00:32.120> we've<00:00:33.120> been

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
anyways it's because we're uh we've been

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
anyways it's because we're uh we've been
able<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> technology<00:00:34.640> really

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
able to make all the technology really

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.290 
able to make all the technology really
it<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.760> mostly<00:00:36.270> east<00:00:37.110> asians<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.300> europeans

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it was mostly east asians and europeans

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
it was mostly east asians and europeans
and<00:00:39.480> stuff<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.739> areas<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.340> world

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and stuff you know in areas of the world

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.020 
and stuff you know in areas of the world
that<00:00:41.670> had<00:00:42.450> desk<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.710> less<00:00:44.219> resources<00:00:44.730> or

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that had desk that had less resources or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.600 
that had desk that had less resources or
colder<00:00:45.450> climates<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.680> had<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.100> smarter

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
colder climates so you had to be smarter

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.560 
colder climates so you had to be smarter
and<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.270> stuff<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> that's<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and do more stuff but that's one of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
and do more stuff but that's one of the
reasons<00:00:51.840> why<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.199> build<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> stuff<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
reasons why we build all this stuff I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
reasons why we build all this stuff I
mean<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:59.160> animals<00:00:59.719> no

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
mean we really are all just animals no

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.290 
mean we really are all just animals no
my<00:01:00.870> speech<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> shaky<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.149> think<00:01:03.149> we

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
my speech is kind of shaky but think we

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.399 
my speech is kind of shaky but think we
all<00:01:03.420> need<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> face<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> truth<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.990> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
all need to face this the truth is we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
all need to face this the truth is we
all<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.920> i<00:01:07.979> mean<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.360> talk<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
all are i mean we think we can talk and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.620 
all are i mean we think we can talk and
everything<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> since<00:01:12.420> we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
everything but it's just that since we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.140 
everything but it's just that since we
were<00:01:12.780> raised<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.710> understand<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.820> words<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
were raised to understand the words that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
were raised to understand the words that
are<00:01:15.240> coming<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> our<00:01:15.869> mouths<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.400> didn't

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
think the girls don't fart or anything

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.499 
think the girls don't fart or anything
or<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:38.509> it's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
or you know but we know they do and it's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
or you know but we know they do and it's
like<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.930> try<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> pretend<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.490> go

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
like we try to pretend that we don't go

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
like we try to pretend that we don't go
to<00:01:41.820> bathroom<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.360> anything<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> course<00:01:43.710> we

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
to bathroom or anything and of course we

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.770 
to bathroom or anything and of course we
know<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.340> but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.380 

I<00:01:46.840> guess<00:01:47.799> if<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.670> because<00:01:51.909> we're<00:01:52.180> so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
I guess if it really is because we're so

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.070 
I guess if it really is because we're so
smart<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:52.840> everything<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.220> because<00:01:54.610> we

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
smart and everything it is because we

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.330 
smart and everything it is because we
think<00:01:56.080> a<00:01:56.320> lot<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.740> than<00:01:56.979> other<00:01:57.280> animals

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
think a lot more than other animals

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.510 
think a lot more than other animals
apparently<00:01:58.210> or<00:01:58.390> as<00:01:58.600> far<00:01:58.869> as<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.140> know<00:01:59.320> and<00:02:00.310> we

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
apparently or as far as we know and we

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.609 
apparently or as far as we know and we
have<00:02:00.700> built<00:02:01.119> all<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> stuff<00:02:01.720> which<00:02:01.990> compared

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
have built all the stuff which compared

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.830 
have built all the stuff which compared
to<00:02:02.740> other<00:02:02.920> species<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.610> planet<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:04.600> far<00:02:04.810> as

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
to other species on the planet as far as

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.899 
to other species on the planet as far as
we<00:02:05.050> know<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.350> not<00:02:05.470> built<00:02:05.710> civilizations<00:02:06.700> or

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
we know have not built civilizations or

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.130 
we know have not built civilizations or
anything<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.880> we<00:02:10.420> think<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.869> oh

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
anything like this so we think that oh

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.380 
anything like this so we think that oh
there's<00:02:11.680> no<00:02:11.890> way<00:02:12.160> we're<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.790> smart<00:02:13.030> there<00:02:13.300> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
there's no way we're so smart there is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.660 
there's no way we're so smart there is
no<00:02:13.600> way<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:14.080> could<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.350> evolved<00:02:15.340> like<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
no way we could have evolved like the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
no way we could have evolved like the

other animals probably did we must have
been<00:02:18.040> made<00:02:18.220> by<00:02:18.250> God<00:02:18.730> or<00:02:19.000> some<00:02:19.180> higher<00:02:19.420> being

fine<00:02:25.410> because<00:02:26.410> we<00:02:26.680> are<00:02:26.860> animals<00:02:28.170> were

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
fine because we are animals were

something<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:57.100> know<00:02:57.209> our<00:02:58.209> genes<00:02:58.570> are

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
something you know our genes are

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.509 
something you know our genes are
slightly<00:02:59.079> altered<00:02:59.560> enough<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.340> look

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
slightly altered enough so that we look

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.370 
slightly altered enough so that we look
slightly<00:03:00.730> different<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:02.110> slightly

share ninety-eight percent of our DNA
with<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> chimp<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:12.010> obviously<00:03:12.900> physically<00:03:13.900> we

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
with a chimp but obviously physically we

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.579 
with a chimp but obviously physically we
look<00:03:14.620> radically<00:03:14.920> different
