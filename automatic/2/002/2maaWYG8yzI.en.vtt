it's a bit straight
to<00:00:16.390> navigate<00:00:16.840> around<00:00:16.990> so<00:00:17.470> I'd<00:00:17.740> quite<00:00:18.009> like<00:00:18.070> to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
to navigate around so I'd quite like to

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.540 
to navigate around so I'd quite like to
do<00:00:18.550> it<00:00:18.699> in<00:00:19.000> bit<00:00:19.960> by<00:00:20.140> bit<00:00:20.169> so<00:00:20.949> this<00:00:21.130> first<00:00:21.369> video

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
I'm going to show you how to set up raw

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.099 
I'm going to show you how to set up raw
I<00:00:23.410> did<00:00:23.980> do<00:00:24.160> this<00:00:24.340> previously<00:00:24.910> on<00:00:25.270> showing<00:00:25.989> you

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
talk through all of these there's this

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.370 
talk through all of these there's this
one<00:01:27.160> which<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.489> its<00:01:27.670> raw<00:01:28.149> file<00:01:28.450> in<00:01:28.720> directory

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380

one which is its raw file in directory
with<00:01:29.560> JPEG<00:01:30.039> I<00:01:30.340> like<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.090> have<00:01:31.209> this<00:01:31.420> because

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
with JPEG I like to have this because

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.630 
with JPEG I like to have this because
what<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.289> does<00:01:32.440> is<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.679> saves<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.099> all<00:01:33.220> into<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
what it does is it saves it all into the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.300 
what it does is it saves it all into the
safe<00:01:33.849> folder<00:01:34.239> on<00:01:34.450> your<00:01:34.479> SD<00:01:34.929> card<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:36.130> you'll

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
safe folder on your SD card so you'll

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.490 
safe folder on your SD card so you'll
have<00:01:36.489> your<00:01:36.640> JPEGs<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.420> your<00:01:37.569> RAW<00:01:37.810> files<00:01:38.080> all

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
in one place if you don't select this it

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.499 
in one place if you don't select this it
will<00:01:41.649> save<00:01:41.950> your<00:01:42.429> RAW<00:01:42.700> files<00:01:42.940> into<00:01:43.330> a

will save your RAW files into a

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.960 
will save your RAW files into a
different<00:01:43.840> folder<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.530> your<00:01:45.009> JPEGs<00:01:45.610> into

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
another now that's fine but the way I

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.910 
another now that's fine but the way I
like<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.420> do<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.929> have<00:01:50.020> them<00:01:50.379> both<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.800> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
like to do is to have them both in the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.279 
like to do is to have them both in the
same<00:01:51.099> folder<00:01:51.550> it's<00:01:52.509> up<00:01:52.629> to<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.869> which<00:01:53.020> way<00:01:53.259> you

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
same folder it's up to you which way you

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.619 
same folder it's up to you which way you
were<00:01:53.679> so<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.819> so<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.060> can<00:01:55.179> switch<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.420> on

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:55.629 
were so that so you can switch that on

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.710 
were so that so you can switch that on
and<00:01:55.750> off<00:01:55.959> for<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.379> same<00:01:56.590> method<00:01:57.569> there's<00:01:58.569> also

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and off for the same method there's also

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.589 
and off for the same method there's also
only<00:01:59.110> first<00:01:59.590> raw<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.160> series<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:00.849> you're<00:02:01.360> doing

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
only first raw in series if you're doing

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.210 
only first raw in series if you're doing
a<00:02:01.750> series<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.110> shots<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> they<00:02:02.920> were<00:02:02.979> all

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
a series of shots and they were all

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.449 
a series of shots and they were all
using<00:02:03.489> raw<00:02:03.910> they're<00:02:04.690> look<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.860> burst<00:02:06.160> mode

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
using raw they're look like a burst mode

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.119 
using raw they're look like a burst mode
or<00:02:06.640> something<00:02:06.819> like<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:08.080> camera<00:02:08.860> takes

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
or something like that the camera takes

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.190 
or something like that the camera takes
so<00:02:09.459> long<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.759> take<00:02:10.209> all<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.509> pictures<00:02:10.840> because

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
so long to take all the pictures because

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500 
so long to take all the pictures because
it<00:02:11.500> would<00:02:11.590> be<00:02:11.770> taking<00:02:12.760> extra<00:02:13.120> time<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.450> take

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
it would be taking extra time to take

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.600 
it would be taking extra time to take
RAW<00:02:13.870> as<00:02:14.019> well<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.860> what<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.160> do<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.400> tell

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
RAW as well so what you can do is tell

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.130 
RAW as well so what you can do is tell
it<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> only<00:02:16.060> take<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.450> first<00:02:16.690> picture<00:02:16.930> in

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it so I only take the first picture in

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.930 
it so I only take the first picture in
raw<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> rest<00:02:17.800> will<00:02:17.980> be<00:02:18.010> JPEG<00:02:18.519> so<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.790> can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
raw and the rest will be JPEG so you can

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.600 
raw and the rest will be JPEG so you can
switch<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.480> off<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:21.190> change

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
switch that on and off you can change

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.340 
switch that on and off you can change
the<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:23.019> prefix<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.430> says<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:25.510> CR<00:02:25.810> W

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the the prefix so it it says here CR W

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.000 
the the prefix so it it says here CR W
so<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.770> bcrw<00:02:27.340> -<00:02:28.000> oh<00:02:28.270> one<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.080> example

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
so it bcrw - oh one for example

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.979 
so it bcrw - oh one for example
and<00:02:30.099> that's<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.750> quickly

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
and that's just so you can quickly

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.839 
and that's just so you can quickly
determine<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.739> it's<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.950> raw<00:02:33.159> file<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.700> you're

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
determine that it's a raw file if you're

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.149 
determine that it's a raw file if you're
just<00:02:34.000> looking<00:02:34.150> at<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> file<00:02:34.690> names<00:02:35.159> it

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
just looking at the file names it

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.360 
just looking at the file names it
doesn't<00:02:36.489> really<00:02:36.640> matter<00:02:37.330> which<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.170> use

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
doesn't really matter which one you use

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.830 
doesn't really matter which one you use
what<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.519> may<00:02:39.700> find<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.299> you're<00:02:40.569> having

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
what you may find is that you're having

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.140 
what you may find is that you're having
trouble<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.200> your<00:02:41.319> raw<00:02:41.680> files<00:02:41.980> opening<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
trouble with your raw files opening you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
trouble with your raw files opening you
just<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.629> be<00:02:43.720> able<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.959> save<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.349> with<00:02:44.530> DNG

just want to be able to save it with DNG
format<00:02:45.489> now<00:02:45.879> I've<00:02:46.000> got<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.299> switch<00:02:46.540> done

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
use the ng you have to create a bad

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.180 
use the ng you have to create a bad
pixel<00:03:06.700> bin<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.379> camera<00:03:08.709> will<00:03:08.769> do<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:08.980> for

pixel bin and the camera will do it for

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.130 
pixel bin and the camera will do it for
you<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.459> you've<00:03:09.609> got<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.849> do<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.140> press

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
you all you've got to do is just press

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.020 
you all you've got to do is just press
ok<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.739> it'll<00:03:11.950> say<00:03:12.069> please<00:03:12.340> wait<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:12.819> takes

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
ok and it'll say please wait this takes

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.970 
ok and it'll say please wait this takes
a<00:03:13.150> few<00:03:13.180> seconds<00:03:13.660> don't<00:03:13.840> panic<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.530> that's

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
a few seconds don't panic and that's

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.080 
a few seconds don't panic and that's
basically<00:03:15.220> because<00:03:15.489> your<00:03:15.640> camera<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:15.970> going

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
basically because your camera is going

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.210 
basically because your camera is going
to<00:03:16.180> take<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.569> couple<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.989> pictures<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.680> it's

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
to take a couple of pictures and it's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.830 
to take a couple of pictures and it's
just<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.609> do<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.180> needs<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.599> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
just going to do what it needs to do to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.640 
just going to do what it needs to do to
create<00:03:20.019> this<00:03:20.440> bad<00:03:21.160> pixel<00:03:21.700> jump<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:23.349> allows

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
create this bad pixel jump in it allows

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.800 
create this bad pixel jump in it allows
you<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.829> take<00:03:24.040> pictures<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:24.519> G&amp;G<00:03:25.329> file<00:03:26.230> format

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.960 

snaps<00:03:31.810> back<00:03:32.049> it's<00:03:32.319> just<00:03:32.560> saying<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.519> pixel

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
snaps back it's just saying that pixel

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.900 
snaps back it's just saying that pixel
jump<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.540> created<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.220> if<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.370> go<00:03:36.519> back<00:03:36.700> into

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
jump in is created so if we go back into

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.930 
jump in is created so if we go back into
our<00:03:37.060> menu<00:03:37.530> go<00:03:38.530> back<00:03:38.709> into<00:03:38.889> our<00:03:39.040> raw<00:03:39.250> parameters

and<00:03:42.940> you'll<00:03:43.269> be<00:03:43.389> able<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.720> use<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.440> DNG<00:03:44.739> format

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
and you'll be able to use the DNG format

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.250 
and you'll be able to use the DNG format
and<00:03:45.579> that<00:03:45.700> will<00:03:45.790> basically<00:03:46.000> override<00:03:46.720> your

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
and that will basically override your

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.659 
and that will basically override your
raw<00:03:47.530> file<00:03:47.829> extension<00:03:49.919> so<00:03:50.919> that's<00:03:51.280> basically

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
raw file extension so that's basically

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.640 
raw file extension so that's basically
how<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:51.910> take<00:03:52.120> pictures<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.660> RAW<00:03:52.900> if<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.470> then
