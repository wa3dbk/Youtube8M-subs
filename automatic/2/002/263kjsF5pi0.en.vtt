00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.519
 Do you know that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.990
 and the bl fraction is bending around with Bellamy 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.440
 obstacles encountered units 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.929
 the arena of his managed geometric shadow 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.999
 there is also something necessary 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.140
 condition in order to 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 was observed 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440
 diffraction 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.740
 we need conditions that cynicism 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.090
 winter vulnerability 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.760
 but the main thing with the size 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.960
 obstacles 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.820
 as we will 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.830
 observe and fraction 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.460
 light waves 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.410
 the size of the obstacles must 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.680
 be very small 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.000
 we will be an observer in this experience 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 diffraction of a laser beam on a shield 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.520
 from dress cancer 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.210
 energy was thrust 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.520
 gives a high degree of monochromatic 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.830
 amitel radiation in red ses 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.150
 in council 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.900
 about 6 wavelength 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.620
 thousand 300 angstrom at 630 nano meters so here 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 sit under a dress cancer falls for baptism 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.510
 so the wine that we can regulate 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 via 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.680
 Crimea lera with help from this ground 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.690
 let's see how the girls look at 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840
 image weaver summer 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.500
 the width of the count of years on objects of this from 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.080
 Images 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.270
 not yet closed will gradually open 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.630
 cabbage 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.299
 But she opened a little bit 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.900
 very Russian take off portray 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.690
 the future on the screen represents 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.390
 elongated maximum 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.979
 the only maximum stretched 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.530
 right and left but intensity 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.850
 maximum edges will be fast 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 increase the width of the gorge 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.040
 networks appeared minimum of 2 minimum 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.279
 right and left of the central 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.689
 Gumilyov maximum as gaps open 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.979
 number of not less than and maximum 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.159
 is increasing 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.180
 and as I reveal they 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.609
 shun site minimum shun in 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.879
 central market 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.049
 maximum if a strongly open account 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.759
 wide gap 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.599
 from the lows sitting are gone in essence 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.939
 we are now 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.439
 in the field of geometric 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.059
 Optics are now diffractive 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.859
 picture is not visible on the screen 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.149
 According to him 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.079
 someone else's communication 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.729
 reappeared at least as 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.109
 as the gap narrows five 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.109
 the minimums scatter them gets smaller 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.709
 a year even if the last minimum 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.240
 here are the words for very thick chili 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.229
 again not the only 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.179
 maximum simple to the right of overheating 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.899
 here is the screen 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.579
 That central under the central part 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:06.799
