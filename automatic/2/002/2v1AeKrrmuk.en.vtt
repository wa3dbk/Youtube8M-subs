coming up I am really excited about what

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
coming up I am really excited about what
we're<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.580> saying<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.449> same<00:00:36.479> way<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.260> gonna

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we're all saying the same way is gonna

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.979 
we're all saying the same way is gonna
be<00:00:37.589> a<00:00:37.620> sprint<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.519> the<00:00:38.970> playoffs<00:00:39.420> rather<00:00:39.720> than

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
be a sprint to the playoffs rather than

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
be a sprint to the playoffs rather than
the<00:00:40.110> marathon<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.949> don't<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.729> how<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the marathon I don't know how to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
the marathon I don't know how to
forecast<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.839> you<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:43.019> I<00:00:43.049> look<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.500> young

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
forecast it you know I look at young

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
forecast it you know I look at young
teams<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.850> Islanders<00:00:45.299> and<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.809> they

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
teams like the Islanders and think they

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.689 
teams like the Islanders and think they
might<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.470> advantage<00:00:46.769> if<00:00:47.220> they're<00:00:47.610> gonna

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
might have an advantage if they're gonna

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.369 
might have an advantage if they're gonna
be<00:00:47.850> playing<00:00:47.970> three<00:00:48.479> games<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.960> four<00:00:49.199> nights

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
be playing three games and four nights

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.200 
be playing three games and four nights
or<00:00:49.619> even<00:00:49.830> four<00:00:50.070> games<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.489> five<00:00:50.670> nights<00:00:50.940> with

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
or even four games in five nights with

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.070 
or even four games in five nights with
some<00:00:51.360> regularity

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
some regularity

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.740 
some regularity
you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.799> maybe<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.250> young<00:00:53.580> legs<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.360> be

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you know maybe those young legs will be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.289 
you know maybe those young legs will be
best<00:00:55.080> served<00:00:55.229> to<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.309> through<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.119> of

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
best served to get through that kind of

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.259 
best served to get through that kind of
a<00:00:57.390> pressure<00:00:58.229> pack<00:00:58.619> condense<00:00:59.129> schedule<00:00:59.640> but

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
a pressure pack condense schedule but

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.759 
a pressure pack condense schedule but
then<00:01:00.360> I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.659> of<00:01:00.750> older<00:01:01.019> teams<00:01:01.290> like<00:01:01.589> the

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
then I think of older teams like the

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.160 
then I think of older teams like the
Rangers<00:01:02.159> and<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:03.059> maybe<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.839> best

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
Rangers and how maybe they're best

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.680 
Rangers and how maybe they're best
suited<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> short<00:01:05.489> season<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
suited because it's a short season that

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.630 
suited because it's a short season that
they<00:01:07.140> won't<00:01:07.470> suffer<00:01:07.830> through<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.310> battle

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
they won't suffer through the battle

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.540 
they won't suffer through the battle
fatigue<00:01:09.080> going<00:01:10.080> into<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> playoffs<00:01:10.650> after<00:01:11.220> 48

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
fatigue going into the playoffs after 48

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.450 
fatigue going into the playoffs after 48
games<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.290> after<00:01:14.130> 82

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
games that they would you know after 82

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.520 
games that they would you know after 82
it's<00:01:14.850> fascinating<00:01:15.480> I<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.690> no<00:01:15.870> idea<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's fascinating I have no idea what to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's fascinating I have no idea what to
expect

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
expect

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
expect
but<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.180> level<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.600> play<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.230> gonna

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
but I think the level of play is gonna

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.470 
but I think the level of play is gonna
have<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.340> darn<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.240> from

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
have to be pretty darn good right from

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.360 
have to be pretty darn good right from
the<00:01:21.630> beginning<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.260> think<00:01:22.500> every<00:01:22.980> one<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> these

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
the beginning I think every one of these

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.130 
the beginning I think every one of these
games<00:01:23.640> almost<00:01:24.060> gonna<00:01:24.180> feel<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.660> playoff

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
games almost gonna feel like a playoff

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
games almost gonna feel like a playoff
game<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.220> we'll<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:27.120> regular

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
game so that we'll have more regular

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.490 
game so that we'll have more regular
season

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
season

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.920 
season
tension<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.280> excitement<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.240> 48<00:01:30.720> game

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
tension and excitement in this 48 game

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.220 
tension and excitement in this 48 game
format<00:01:31.470> than<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.580> normally<00:01:32.940> do<00:01:33.120> in<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.420> 82<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
format than we normally do in the 82 so

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.080 
format than we normally do in the 82 so
I'm<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:35.010> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.340> pumped<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.940> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I'm really kind of pumped for it in that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
I'm really kind of pumped for it in that
context<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> sounds<00:01:37.620> like<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.010> expects

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
context so it sounds like how we expects

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
context so it sounds like how we expects
every<00:01:39.060> game<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.300> look<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> playoff<00:01:40.320> game

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
every game to look like a playoff game

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
every game to look like a playoff game
