also on this one this is my original saw
the<00:00:18.660> velcro<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.260> always<00:00:19.439> use<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.890> was

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the velcro that I always use when I was

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.580 
the velcro that I always use when I was
a<00:00:20.100> contractor<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.970> has<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.539> round<00:00:21.900> frame<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
a contractor it has a round frame and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.620 
a contractor it has a round frame and
this<00:00:22.920> mounts<00:00:23.430> perfectly<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> mountain<00:00:24.480> foot

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this mounts perfectly on a mountain foot

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710 
this mounts perfectly on a mountain foot
round<00:00:24.869> frame<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.430> even<00:00:26.699> mounts<00:00:27.150> better<00:00:27.449> on

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
round frame but it even mounts better on

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
round frame but it even mounts better on
a<00:00:27.779> flat<00:00:28.199> frame<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> particular

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
a flat frame and in this particular

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.139 
a flat frame and in this particular
application<00:00:30.500> if<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.679> mounted<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.700> felt

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
application if I mounted it here I felt

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
application if I mounted it here I felt
that<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> side<00:00:33.660> would<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.350> too<00:00:34.500> low

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
that the side would be a little too low

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.889 
that the side would be a little too low
so<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.610> wanted<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.450> higher<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so I wanted it up a little higher so I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
so I wanted it up a little higher so I
decided<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> mount<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.340> screw<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> right

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
decided to mount it or screw it right

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
decided to mount it or screw it right
into<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> side<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
into the side here and you can see that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
into the side here and you can see that
I've<00:00:40.890> done<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I've done that right there so this is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.869 
I've done that right there so this is
what<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.320> take<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.879> accessory

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
what you do you take this accessory

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
what you do you take this accessory
mounting<00:00:45.210> clamp<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.230> take<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.620> off

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
mounting clamp you just take this off

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
mounting clamp you just take this off
like<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.629> whip<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> knobs<00:00:48.989> off<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> they're

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
like this whip the knobs off and they're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
like this whip the knobs off and they're
pretty<00:00:51.360> long<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.050> made<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.440> fit

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty long because we made them so fit

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
pretty long because we made them so fit
on<00:00:52.949> everything<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> pop<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
on everything and then you pop the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.119 
on everything and then you pop the
screws<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:56.239> just<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:59.010> I'm

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
screws out just like this and then I'm

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
screws out just like this and then I'm
even<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.789> off<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.210> part<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.260> it's

so now I go ahead and put this on and
you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:03.890> see<00:02:04.220> really<00:02:04.400> clearly<00:02:04.760> here<00:02:05.150> our

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you can see really clearly here our

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
you can see really clearly here our
ratcheting<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.020> we<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.710> have

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
ratcheting that we have here we have

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.070 
ratcheting that we have here we have
these<00:02:06.979> fine<00:02:07.340> little<00:02:07.520> precision<00:02:08.360> adjusters

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
these fine little precision adjusters

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.800 
these fine little precision adjusters
and<00:02:09.350> they<00:02:09.890> go<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.360> nice<00:02:11.540> thing

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and they go in there and the nice thing

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.570 
and they go in there and the nice thing
is<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.110> design<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.310> same

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
is when we design this it's the same

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.320 
is when we design this it's the same
knob<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:15.500> both<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.250> bracket<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.730> mounts<00:02:17.209> on

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
knob for both the bracket that mounts on

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.300 
knob for both the bracket that mounts on
here<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.810> well<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.380> adjustment<00:02:18.950> one<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
here as well as this adjustment one and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.340 
here as well as this adjustment one and
now<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.840> you're<00:02:21.080> set

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
now you put it on there and you're set

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.440 
now you put it on there and you're set
and<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.590> put<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:21.980> both<00:02:22.310> sides<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.000> now

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
and you put that on both sides and now

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.210 
and you put that on both sides and now
you've<00:02:23.630> got<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> place<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.319> mount<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.770> solid

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you've got a place to mount the solid

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.770 
you've got a place to mount the solid
and<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.489> was<00:02:25.580> very<00:02:25.790> simple<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.239> very<00:02:26.330> easy<00:02:26.660> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and it was very simple and very easy to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.140 
and it was very simple and very easy to
do<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.110> course<00:02:27.250> these<00:02:28.250> brackets<00:02:28.580> will<00:02:29.030> go

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
do and of course these brackets will go

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150 
do and of course these brackets will go
on<00:02:29.270> any<00:02:29.510> machine<00:02:29.930> we<00:02:30.290> had<00:02:30.440> people<00:02:30.680> put<00:02:30.950> them<00:02:31.070> on

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
on any machine we had people put them on

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.060 
on any machine we had people put them on
lathe<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:32.269> know<00:02:32.390> table<00:02:33.080> saws<00:02:33.260> any<00:02:33.650> time<00:02:33.950> you

application you could mount this on
there<00:02:38.300> you've<00:02:38.510> got<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.870> place<00:02:39.080> now<00:02:39.320> you've

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
there you've got the place now you've

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.990 
there you've got the place now you've
got<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> built<00:02:40.010> an<00:02:40.130> accessory<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:40.880> you're

piece of travertine right he had his saw

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.620 
piece of travertine right he had his saw
would<00:02:49.340> adjust<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.820> over<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.269> too<00:02:50.450> much

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
would adjust it over a little too much

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.270 
would adjust it over a little too much
and<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.230> said<00:02:51.440> all<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.800> do<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.040> loosen

this up and bring it move it all or you
have<00:02:54.230> very<00:02:54.739> large<00:02:55.040> material<00:02:55.400> good<00:02:55.970> being<00:02:56.720> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
have very large material good being a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.790 
have very large material good being a
couple<00:02:57.080> other<00:02:57.200> things<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.470> want<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.709> draw

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
couple other things we want to draw

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.830 
couple other things we want to draw
attention<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:59.090> we've<00:02:59.269> got<00:02:59.570> our

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
attention to is that we've got our

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.590 
attention to is that we've got our
little<00:03:00.110> overhang<00:03:00.769> hood<00:03:01.070> pushed<00:03:01.489> back<00:03:01.760> now<00:03:02.030> so

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
little overhang hood pushed back now so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.240 
little overhang hood pushed back now so
we<00:03:02.840> can<00:03:03.019> bring<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.380> all<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.500> way<00:03:03.650> forward<00:03:04.010> like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
we can bring it all the way forward like

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.160 
we can bring it all the way forward like
this<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:04.910> sometimes<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> side<00:03:05.750> that

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
this but sometimes on the side that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.780 
this but sometimes on the side that
might<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.560> covering<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.340> too<00:03:07.459> much<00:03:07.640> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
might be covering a little too much and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.250 
might be covering a little too much and
you<00:03:07.880> want<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.060> little<00:03:08.209> more<00:03:08.390> light<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.200> can

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
you want a little more light so you can

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.020 
you want a little more light so you can
just<00:03:09.440> push<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.920> back<00:03:10.190> like<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
just push this back like that and it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.759 
just push this back like that and it
works<00:03:11.209> well<00:03:11.420> another<00:03:12.200> thing<00:03:12.440> we<00:03:12.530> want<00:03:12.680> to

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
works well another thing we want to

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.190 
works well another thing we want to
point<00:03:12.980> out<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.370> these<00:03:13.820> velcro<00:03:14.180> closures<00:03:14.959> right

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
point out is these velcro closures right

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.470 
point out is these velcro closures right
here<00:03:15.440> which<00:03:15.590> actually<00:03:15.799> hold<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.060> solid

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
here which actually hold the solid

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.690 
here which actually hold the solid
together<00:03:17.810> when<00:03:18.079> we<00:03:18.200> collapse<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.920> are<00:03:19.400> also

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
together when we collapse it are also

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.660 
together when we collapse it are also
very<00:03:20.510> effective<00:03:20.739> for<00:03:21.739> tying<00:03:22.070> things<00:03:22.400> together

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
very effective for tying things together

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.970 
very effective for tying things together
to<00:03:23.510> finally<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.110> help<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.560> funneling

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
to finally to help with the funneling

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 
to finally to help with the funneling
effect<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.880> on<00:03:26.030> both<00:03:26.209> sides<00:03:26.269> and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
effect so we do that on both sides and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.940 
effect so we do that on both sides and
now<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.079> go<00:03:27.170> ahead<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.380> make<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> cut<00:03:27.769> with

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
now it's go ahead and make a cut with

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:38.320 
now it's go ahead and make a cut with
this<00:03:28.070> sock

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.180 

I'm<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.750> more<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> culture<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.830> can<00:03:41.010> see

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
I'm in the more a culture you can see

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.979 
I'm in the more a culture you can see
just<00:03:41.430> how<00:03:41.550> much<00:03:41.849> that<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.330> going<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> back
