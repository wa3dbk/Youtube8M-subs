00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
one of the biggest things that I've

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.400 
one of the biggest things that I've
learned<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.570> training<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:47.990> that<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.170> have<00:03:48.290> to

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
learned to training is that you have to

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.290 
learned to training is that you have to
overcome<00:03:48.440> overcome<00:03:49.130> your<00:03:49.460> mind<00:03:49.730> telling<00:03:50.210> you

everybody<00:03:55.850> can<00:03:56.060> reach<00:03:56.270> that<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.990> point<00:03:57.290> of

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
everybody can reach that that point of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.220
