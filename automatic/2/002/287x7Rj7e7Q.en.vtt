00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 we found the sniper jose pedraza 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.750
 that the next one will be facing 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.179
 the Filipino michael farenas is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.920

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.900
 we are in a very good condition this 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 what was missing to do the weight that already 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.570
 we are 23 books and what is left 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 be so well prepared we are fine 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 happy we are anxious nervous 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.809
 all of all that is normal 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.809
 and channeling it is knowing how to control it 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.000
 and prove to demonstrate in all that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.059
 training and all this hard work 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.230
 what we have done and a strong boxer 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.760
 great stuck 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.379
 maybe the fans have a bit of 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.410
 fear of which we lose a boxing of the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.690
 unbeaten the plan so and do not give me or 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.600
 they are ready for what they bring but 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.239
 if we know that an extremely strong boxing 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.119
 experienced a lot of great experience 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.759
 combat that you have had for example with the 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.900
 Gamboa as Cuban is another know 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.850
 you have to be in the best preparation 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.590
 we know we are consenting but 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.210
 we know that pedraza has all the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.710
 qualities has all the potential is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.910
 very intelligent and extremely internal and 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.070
 terry independent of him is it from 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.410
 prepared are you from a plan of 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 work but logically boxing is 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 changing me every minute that changes that 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.770
 they fight over you have to change and we're 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.720
 prepared already and we've talked we've 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 hidden all the probability that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.649
 we have sometimes there will be a moment that 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.080
 will have to negotiate will have to be tied 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.210
 this is a face in a walk we do not 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.280
 we can focus that one more fight in one 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.440
 extremely important fight in the race 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.680
 professional of jose pedraza 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.420
 the highlight of his career more 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 beyond the same world championship 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.280
 we know that this fight is here more 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.020
 important that of the Cuban and we are 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.940
 prepared we are prepared 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.150
 like people from town people that we like 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.820
 sometimes enter into a good dispute to 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.830
 dispositive with respect to others 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.430
 but pedraza and I are extremely 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.810
 joyful happy and we know what's left 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.270
 fanaticada is excited about this 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.680
 fight and what we want to come on 14 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.600
 November to the Coliseum 'Roberto 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.220
 clemente 'to be part of the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.320
 history of pedraza and puerto rico 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.630
 because it is a fight of a good fight 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.850
 we just met the boy because no 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.280
 reflects what maybe for this mind 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.920
 we have extremely humble very very very 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.140
 friendly very accessible from a 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.060
 reconciliation between him and my daughter 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.220
 he had to do home arabia 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 because she is a girl who loves her 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.300
 brother and can interpret what is the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.820
 boxing you already know what boxing is when 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 I told her that I had 39 and 31 ko and 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.810
 he expanded his show and when he heard the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.730
 boy say that he was going it nokia that 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.620
 had to be assaulted in conciliation 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.480
 because that's the beauty of boxing 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.459
 we are visiting a woman and that same thing 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.030
 is going to ask the two he gets to the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.129
 trust thing to say I'm going to knock him out 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.190
 does some training in you do 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.920
 make a change but nothing nothing us 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.370
 We do not give importance to your 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.920
 comments from nokia we are 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.690
 well prepared the preparation that we have 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.170
 done we are going to show it in the ring and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.880
 always simple if I would win if I would win 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.470
 for then I would win by cutting because 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.840
 that we come to that we come to work 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.640
 much much boxing 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.530
 such and they do not have but they do fight 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.750
 we fight we are also prepared for 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.660
 we all have a plan we have a plan already 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.920
 but yes you have to change it you change 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.560
 this is the least 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.470
 louis I ask you a lot of people think of 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.600
 pedraza beat the Filipino 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.370
 it's practically the title because they say 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.050
 that if pedraza passes this test with 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.940
 michael farenas is a stronger test 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.470
 of what would be the Cuban that you think 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.760
 about these first and we have thought 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.800
 it is in that we have hidden the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.280
 possibilities that we have already seen Cubans 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.680
 We know it's good when you decide a 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.450
 person there is a code has a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.430
 left the first three rounds that 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.370
 it is extremely dangerous the moves well is 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.900
 fast but pedraza has more more 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.480
 odds with the Cuban who with 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.970
 this same now that there is some data 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.489
 interesting when she decided to come to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.109
 puerto rico for such an important fight 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.730
 and that gives you to know that you have to 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.430
 be in better condition and in the best 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.930
 mental mental preparation because because 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.650
 well-being a strong work have 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.560
 a fame 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.900
 and he wants to continue and you have to know 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.060
 handle all those emotions keep the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.070
 reason outside the emotions because the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.780
 emotions confuse you and do not let you 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.449
 flow thinking and execution 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.120
 pedraza is distinguished by that is wrong 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.780
 it's cold-blooded to say it so and the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.550
 experience he received in the amateur 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.320
 doing so many olympic trips 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.900
 Pan-American, not global, but thanks to 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.539
 sir picked up all that and that night they go to 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.820
 see a pedraza to an expert on that night 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.620
 a snack from the expert but he does it more 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.050
 good for your career but more for your 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.180
 people for the puerto rico and pedraza goes to 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.300
 open the doors that the boys 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.610
 that come back as belle de bomba 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.590
 the twins streams that are great 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.990
 many moments that will come later 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.370
 of this fight because pedraza open the 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.770
 doors to the world so that puerto rico 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.720
 be a boxing mecca again 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.460
 professional as was the horse 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.190

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.139
 gomez only sword and all fat 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.120

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.280
