will get jam arriving at the price and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
will get jam arriving at the price and
also<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.200> have<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.440> press<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.130> a<00:00:59.309> special

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
also that we have to press in a special

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
also that we have to press in a special
way<00:01:00.660> another<00:01:01.170> reason<00:01:01.500> why<00:01:01.620> champion<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.220> can

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
way another reason why champion you can

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
way another reason why champion you can
see<00:01:02.579> two<00:01:02.820> different<00:01:02.969> systems<00:01:03.769> original

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
see two different systems original

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
see two different systems original
pressing<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> vertical<00:01:05.610> pressing<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
pressing and the vertical pressing the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
pressing and the vertical pressing the
original<00:01:07.439> pressing<00:01:07.829> is<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.579> can<00:01:08.759> see

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
original pressing is one you can see

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.490 
original pressing is one you can see
almost<00:01:09.509> I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.790> region's<00:01:12.500> can

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
almost I think all of the region's can

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
almost I think all of the region's can
give<00:01:13.710> miss<00:01:13.860> plates<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.880> side<00:01:15.090> which<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
give miss plates on the side which is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.209 
give miss plates on the side which is
not<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:15.719> good<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.319> the<00:01:16.560> most<00:01:16.740> modern<00:01:17.039> which

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
not very good and the most modern which

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.999 
not very good and the most modern which
ultimately<00:01:17.490> prices<00:01:18.209> which<00:01:18.359> are<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.600> better

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
ultimately prices which are much better

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.309 
ultimately prices which are much better
but<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.939> best<00:01:21.090> system<00:01:21.600> remains<00:01:22.079> an

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
but I think the best system remains an

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.969 
but I think the best system remains an
ethical<00:01:22.709> price<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.899> we<00:01:24.899> are<00:01:25.020> getting<00:01:25.170> swing

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
ethical price and we are getting swing

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.059 
ethical price and we are getting swing
advantages<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.959> from<00:01:28.350> 230-4<00:01:28.859> price

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
advantages of the from 230-4 price

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.980 
advantages of the from 230-4 price
compared<00:01:29.459> to<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.789> original<00:01:29.999> one<00:01:30.539> because<00:01:30.959> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
compared to the original one because of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.519 
compared to the original one because of
its<00:01:31.289> physical<00:01:32.219> shape<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> crystal<00:01:34.109> content

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:34.529 
its physical shape the crystal content

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.399 
its physical shape the crystal content
marketing<00:01:35.039> is<00:01:35.249> that<00:01:35.399> when<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.850> load<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:37.200> fruit

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
marketing is that when we load the fruit

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
marketing is that when we load the fruit
inside<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> past<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.429> great<00:01:38.609> don't<00:01:38.939> have

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
your fruits which are by design you put

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.750 
your fruits which are by design you put
them<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.290> video<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.489> make<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
them back in the video that you make a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.810 
them back in the video that you make a
smaller<00:02:45.269> plate<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.890> basically<00:02:47.430> start

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
smaller plate and you basically start

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.699 
smaller plate and you basically start
again<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.959> can<00:02:49.489> now<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.850> an<00:02:50.970> original

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.680 

you<00:02:54.709> have<00:02:54.830> no<00:02:55.040> direct<00:02:55.580> access<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.450> fruit

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
you have no direct access to the fruit

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.890 
you have no direct access to the fruit
so<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.620> only<00:02:57.860> way<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.209> unscrew

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
so the only way to do it is to unscrew
