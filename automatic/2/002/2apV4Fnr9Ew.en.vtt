and<00:00:23.279> I'll<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.090> played<00:00:24.420> by<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> vector

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

bling<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.490> using<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> UMP<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
bling but I'm gonna be using the UMP and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
bling but I'm gonna be using the UMP and
in<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.859> opinion<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.279> UMP<00:00:29.580> isn't<00:00:29.820> overpowered

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
in my opinion the UMP isn't overpowered

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
in my opinion the UMP isn't overpowered
it's<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> most<00:00:30.900> overused<00:00:31.260> SMG<00:00:32.009> because

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's just the most overused SMG because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090 
it's just the most overused SMG because
mostly<00:00:33.149> other<00:00:33.270> SMGs<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.140> modern<00:00:34.800> warfare<00:00:34.950> 2

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
mostly other SMGs in modern warfare 2

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240 
mostly other SMGs in modern warfare 2
pretty<00:00:35.850> bad<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.540> painting<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.160> probably<00:00:38.160> an

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
pretty bad the painting is probably an

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
pretty bad the painting is probably an
exception<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.120> pretty<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
exception it's pretty good and the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.240 
exception it's pretty good and the
vector<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.469> paired<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> mini

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
vector is not paired up with the mini

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
vector is not paired up with the mini
Izzie<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.000> amplifier<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.930> could<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
Izzie and the amplifier but I could and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.799 
Izzie and the amplifier but I could and
the<00:00:43.440> UMP<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.820> best<00:00:45.000> SMG<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:45.690> why

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the UMP is just the best SMG that's why

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.880 
the UMP is just the best SMG that's why
you<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> lot<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> people<00:00:46.620> running<00:00:46.770> around

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you see a lot of people running around

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
you see a lot of people running around
with<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> notice<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> many<00:00:47.969> people

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
with it and you notice a many people

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
with it and you notice a many people
running<00:00:48.420> around<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:49.010> peanuts<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.039> stuff

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
running around with peanuts and stuff

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.799 
running around with peanuts and stuff
and<00:00:50.460> mini<00:00:50.700> uses<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.149> even<00:00:51.449> pace<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and mini uses because even pace is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.729 
and mini uses because even pace is
frankly<00:00:52.140> better<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> do

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
frankly better and you're gonna do

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
frankly better and you're gonna do
better<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:53.879> using<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> UMP<00:00:54.510> I'm

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
better with it so I'm using the UMP I'm

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.299 
better with it so I'm using the UMP I'm
missing<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> silencer<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.039> because<00:00:56.250> that's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
missing a silencer on it because that's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.590 
missing a silencer on it because that's
just<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> best<00:00:56.670> attachment<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
just the best attachment to go with the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
just the best attachment to go with the
un<00:00:57.780> pedo<00:00:58.039> extended<00:00:59.039> mags<00:00:59.219> has<00:00:59.760> enough<00:00:59.940> balls

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
un pedo extended mags has enough balls

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
un pedo extended mags has enough balls
in<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.329> clip<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.800> at

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
in this clip and that you can get at

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
in this clip and that you can get at
least<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.699> three<00:01:02.730> kills<00:01:03.120> per<00:01:03.329> clip<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
least two or three kills per clip with

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.440 
least two or three kills per clip with
the<00:01:04.049> UMP<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:05.339> no<00:01:05.430> need<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.670> extended

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the UMP so there's no need for extended

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.550 
the UMP so there's no need for extended
mags<00:01:06.600> or<00:01:06.659> anything<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> don't

weren't<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.409> good<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.759> lie<00:01:17.880> they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
weren't very good I'm not gonna lie they

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
weren't very good I'm not gonna lie they
weren't<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> best<00:01:18.450> players<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> world

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
weren't the best players in the world

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
weren't the best players in the world
but<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> tactical<00:01:19.950> recon<00:01:20.280> team

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
but I think it a tactical recon team

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
but I think it a tactical recon team
deathmatch<00:01:20.790> again<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.560> I've<00:01:22.560> been<00:01:22.799> looking

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
deathmatch again and I've been looking

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
deathmatch again and I've been looking
it<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.610> lately<00:01:24.030> uh<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> putting<00:01:25.110> on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it a lot lately uh I think is putting on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.480 
it a lot lately uh I think is putting on
