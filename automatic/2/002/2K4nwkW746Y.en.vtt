00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.290
 the technical tip this week is on the issue an important piece of your 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.559
 know how to take care of 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.789
 the position is one of the pieces that make up the bike of a motorcycle 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.359
 as well as hers the art head 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 the crankshaft the valve and the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.869
 both valve is a cylindrical part made of aluminum the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.449
 leading aluminum 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.070
 it is also known as compost because it makes a movement similar to the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 plunger of a syringe 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.540
 the point is to see the essential piece 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.590
 for that changed and has to functioning and pine trees also had where the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.960
 reactor explosions 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.780
 the scene 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.070
 are admitted 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.980
 are running one way and longitudinally inside the candy coming up 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.380
 that he stays on Saturday he has a fixing pin 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.760
 with two holes in the alley where it makes a longitudinal movement 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.980
 in the back and forth motion 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 where in the head of the piston that occur the new explosions 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.340
 and the temperature at the top of the question 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280
 the driving driver arrives until 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 300 degrees the issue is also composed of responsible segment rings 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 by the fence and diop are inserting it has the gas leak says 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 and engine compression 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.359
 when this important piece has a problem 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.020
 she gives some signals 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 like smoke coming out of the exhaust leak 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.259
 in extreme cases the beautiful is carried out on this date 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.789
 in low-displacement engines the average piston life is 40,000 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.249
 kilometers in notes above 60 cylinders eighty thousand kilometers more 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:55.110
 piston durability is not measured exactly by kilometers driven as 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.799
 example we are going to show this question of a motorcycle with 90 thousand kilometers of use 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.409
 what is normal 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.290
 already the one of salt another motorcycle with only 20 thousand kilometers was here in hand in the 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.219
 and it will need to be changed 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.819
 to increase the life of the piston only a few precautions are needed 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.749
 basic are two aggravating phrase Pakistani first the lack of 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:19.979
 lubrication 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.039
 called it poor quality 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.489
 lots of exchange mileage 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.750
 and are aggravating to kidnapped another 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.340
 forgetfulness 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.269
 It's legal mutual in the morning. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.419
 even pacenses try a little told 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:38.549
 is very important the motor heating we are wearing off the following 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.569
 ways 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.069
 not cleaning the air filter 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.989
 correctly in the dry periods 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 or the bike goes without the filter element 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.259
 the lack of an eye on a motorcycle 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:58.559
 for not exchanging hate periodically and one of the reasons also that occurs when 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:03.109
 the engine is not well regulated it's working with a poor mix 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.340
 Where did you vote? 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.669
 works with heating 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.179
 much more heating occurring the locking of the driver and depending 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.579
 of the case, I'll be fine 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.849
 boal duct piercing issue of spark plugs at time of exchange 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.949
 floor then it is necessary to buy the original there are parallel bags 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:29.290
 looks at the deaths so large displaced networks only original even 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.809
 bag 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:36.249
 on smaller bikes up to 125 up to 17 cylinders have parallels today 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.679
 on day of good quality specialist in terms of maintenance close to the load 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.129
 is a very complex service. 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.500
 in smaller engines are spaces for easier beings more common 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:53.679
 because it is a partial counting gun of the author and his top part we love 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.229
 so it's not so complicated 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.389
 there is a parallel market today 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.120
 of these so good or even better in some cases 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.449
 your brother 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.129
 Talita tranquil about this photo after the musician has been falling quite a bit like 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.040
 Christian is an important piece that composes a pain 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.830
 it is not even necessary to mention that the quality of this item service team 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.560
 carried out are fundamental 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.389
 but our technical collaborators reinforce the idea is the bidding are 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.410
 piston that is not of good quality and the exchange was also not made 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.680
 According to the jox problems may have 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.379
 already the first lady skill in the new journey ends this party 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.169
 the service 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.550
 Dutch will be done in our chest and the workforce will have to be redone with 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.169
 assurance 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.720
 now you have there two pistons also one of the current average 80's 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.560
 I explained that we have to evolve in terms of fishing in those decades and for 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.210
 that's blowing 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.900
 for example is the one that is a matter of being visited 80's 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.900
 most 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.699
 It was bigger and heavier too at night but I still believe 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.250
 It's a lot bigger and it's about 150 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.569
 and today's current 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:02.900
 let's get ready 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.960
 quite a difference in the text 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.889
 in terms of running that go from the river to other 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.970
 the basic operation is the same increase durability 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.789
 increased the reliability of the people will have is the other alter of the floor is this 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.710
 and 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.009
 Attending side has more since taking into account everything that we already 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.860
 we speak 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.659
 author's warming 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.769
 lubrication is what makes difference ships are
