00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
noticed that my stick technique quite

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.849 
noticed that my stick technique quite
loose<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.780> back<00:02:39.989> I'm<00:02:40.200> not<00:02:40.410> trying<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.709> use

for you go to the right cymbal bell that
by<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.410> way<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.710> buzz<00:03:05.950> roll<00:03:07.170> while

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
by the way was a buzz roll while

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.350 
by the way was a buzz roll while
squeezing<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.890> six<00:03:09.160> tights<00:03:09.490> with<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:09.910> front

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
squeezing the six tights with my front

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.540 
squeezing the six tights with my front
of<00:03:10.510> my<00:03:10.630> my<00:03:11.080> thumb<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.440> first<00:03:11.560> finger<00:03:11.710> other

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
of my my thumb and first finger other

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.890 
of my my thumb and first finger other
fingers<00:03:12.790> coming<00:03:13.000> off<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.240> stick<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.810> I'm

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
fingers coming off the stick and I'm

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.720 
fingers coming off the stick and I'm
just<00:03:14.110> trying<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.830> push<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.250> stick<00:03:15.400> into<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
just trying to push the stick into the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.400 
just trying to push the stick into the
drum<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.910> create<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> constant<00:03:20.260> flow

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
drum like that create the constant flow

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.090 
drum like that create the constant flow
of<00:03:20.440> notes<00:03:22.080> easier<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.200> play<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:23.830> double

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
of notes easier to play this in a double

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.140 
of notes easier to play this in a double
stroke<00:03:24.340> because<00:03:24.610> double<00:03:24.850> stroke<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.090> can

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
stroke because double stroke you can

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.400 
stroke because double stroke you can
hear<00:03:25.390> every<00:03:25.570> single<00:03:25.720> though<00:03:25.960> and<00:03:26.140> if<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.290> make

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
hear every single though and if you make

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.460 
hear every single though and if you make
a<00:03:26.440> mistake<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.090> hear<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.600> but<00:03:28.810> we're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
a mistake you can hear it but we're

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.000 
a mistake you can hear it but we're
buzzed

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
buzzed

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.050 
buzzed
this<00:03:30.490> is<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> constant<00:03:31.530> no<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:33.070> easier<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.820> get

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
this is the constant no is easier to get

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.780 
this is the constant no is easier to get
away<00:03:34.300> with<00:03:34.450> mistakes<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:35.020> that<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.550> again<00:03:36.640> you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
away with mistakes in that so again you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.670 
away with mistakes in that so again you
can<00:03:36.910> use<00:03:37.030> bus<00:03:37.270> roll<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.080> for<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.260> rolling<00:03:38.530> said

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
can use bus roll but for it rolling said

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
can use bus roll but for it rolling said
that<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:39.100> can't<00:03:39.370> wait<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:41.430> see<00:03:42.430> what<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
that we can't wait to see what the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.760 
that we can't wait to see what the
practice<00:03:42.970> doing<00:03:43.210> this<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:46.290> used<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.380> come<00:03:47.590> game

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
practice doing this I used to come game

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.440 
practice doing this I used to come game
with<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> patient<00:03:48.340> on<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.520> second<00:03:48.970> note<00:03:49.120> on

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
with the patient on that second note on

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.809 
with the patient on that second note on
the<00:03:49.540> triplets

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
the triplets

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.130 
the triplets
lastly<00:03:52.540> downbeats

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.380 

Mathis<00:04:00.140> stuff<00:04:00.319> like<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.709> but<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.390> only

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
Mathis stuff like that but it only

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.929 
Mathis stuff like that but it only
happens<00:04:02.719> once<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.560> could<00:04:04.489> repeat<00:04:04.730> it

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
happens once you could repeat it

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.090 
happens once you could repeat it
constantly<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.099> foot<00:04:07.489> pull<00:04:07.879> it<00:04:07.969> off
