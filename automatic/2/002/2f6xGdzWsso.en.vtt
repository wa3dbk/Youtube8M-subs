been really really liking it but I did
notice<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> set<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
notice that you really have to set this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
notice that you really have to set this
powder<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.619> very<00:01:49.979> very

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
powder but you do have to be very very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
powder but you do have to be very very
careful<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.500> matte

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
careful because it is more of a matte

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
careful because it is more of a matte
finish<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.990> dry<00:01:55.200> skin<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.680> sure

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
finish so if you have dry skin make sure

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.399 
finish so if you have dry skin make sure
that<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> moisturize<00:01:56.719> beforehand<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that you moisturize beforehand but I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.130 
that you moisturize beforehand but I
really<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.310> far<00:01:59.610> if<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> guys<00:02:00.780> want

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140

these they do not crease at all so this

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.759 
these they do not crease at all so this
color<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.940> actually<00:03:11.390> from<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> classic<00:03:12.410> nude

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.110 
color and I'm just taking the second
color<00:03:14.720> down<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.099> really<00:03:16.370> like<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:16.730> all

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
color down and I really like it for all

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.629 
color down and I really like it for all
over<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.540> eyes<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.139> then<00:03:18.889> for<00:03:19.130> transition

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
over the eyes and then for transition

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.849 
over the eyes and then for transition
color<00:03:19.849> we're<00:03:20.090> taking<00:03:20.419> this<00:03:20.599> taupey<00:03:21.019> color<00:03:21.049> and

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
color we're taking this taupey color and

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.920 
color we're taking this taupey color and
just<00:03:22.010> applying<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.459> onto<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> crease<00:03:23.450> and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
just applying that onto the crease and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.870 
just applying that onto the crease and
just<00:03:24.500> kind<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.799> really<00:03:25.099> blending<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.639> in

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
just kind of really blending that in

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.270 
just kind of really blending that in
again<00:03:26.389> this<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.690> more<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.410> transition<00:03:27.829> color

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
again this is more of a transition color

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.190 
again this is more of a transition color
so<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.700> don't<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.239> pack<00:03:29.419> on<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.690> lot<00:03:30.049> of

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
so you don't have to pack on a lot of

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.879 
so you don't have to pack on a lot of
this<00:03:37.780> okay<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.019> then<00:03:39.169> this<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.440> different

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
this okay and then this is a different

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.890 
this okay and then this is a different
palette<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.340> called<00:03:40.639> Col<00:03:40.940> plum<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.599> we're

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
palette it's called Col plum and we're

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900 
palette it's called Col plum and we're
actually<00:03:42.079> gonna<00:03:42.349> take<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.680> third<00:03:43.250> color<00:03:43.549> down

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
actually gonna take the third color down

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.120
