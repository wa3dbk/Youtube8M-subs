00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.790 

now<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.210> stuff<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:46.020> messy<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
now this stuff is a very messy so I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.080 
now this stuff is a very messy so I
suggest<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> towel<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:47.970> don't

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
suggest you get a towel so you don't

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.040 
suggest you get a towel so you don't
make<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> huge<00:01:48.630> mess

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
make a huge mess

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.310 
make a huge mess
also<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.340> probably<00:01:51.120> would<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.600> blended<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
also I probably would have blended this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:18.300 
also I probably would have blended this
even<00:01:52.740> more<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.280> make<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.760> smooth

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.770 

here's<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.400> close-up<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.910> my<00:02:20.120> hair<00:02:20.480> right

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
here's a close-up of my hair right

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
here's a close-up of my hair right
before<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.410> rinsed<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.070> out<00:02:22.310> make<00:02:22.880> sure<00:02:22.910> you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
before I rinsed it out make sure you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.350 
before I rinsed it out make sure you
rinse<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.720> cool<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.680> cold<00:02:25.580> water<00:02:26.000> because

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
rinse with cool or cold water because

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
rinse with cool or cold water because
the<00:02:26.690> egg<00:02:26.870> will<00:02:27.200> cook<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.920> then<00:02:28.070> you'll<00:02:28.250> have

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the egg will cook and then you'll have

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.330 
the egg will cook and then you'll have
chunks<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> egg<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.510> your<00:02:29.630> hair<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.920> because

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
chunks of egg in your hair so because

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
chunks of egg in your hair so because
this<00:02:34.550> kind<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.850> felt<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.300> light<00:02:35.600> protein

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
