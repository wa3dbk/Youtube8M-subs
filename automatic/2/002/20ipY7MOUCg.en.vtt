00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
okay today I'm gonna do a video where

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.030 
okay today I'm gonna do a video where
I'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.179> results<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.780> my

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
I'm going to show you the results of my

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.530 
I'm going to show you the results of my
my<00:00:05.040> attempt<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> get<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> phosphates<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
my attempt to get the phosphates out of

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.379 
my attempt to get the phosphates out of
my<00:00:06.629> tank<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.859> had<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> real<00:00:08.400> phosphate<00:00:08.910> problem

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
my tank I had a real phosphate problem

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.020 
my tank I had a real phosphate problem
because<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.160> we<00:00:11.160> live<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.519> Central<00:00:11.910> Florida

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
because of we live in Central Florida

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.549 
because of we live in Central Florida
and<00:00:12.509> there's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.750> lot<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.019> phosphate<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and there's a lot of phosphate in the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.820 
and there's a lot of phosphate in the
water<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.549> use<00:00:14.580> tap<00:00:15.389> water<00:00:15.660> for<00:00:16.619> my

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
water and I use tap water for my

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.090 
water and I use tap water for my
saltwater<00:00:17.699> aquarium<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.859> just<00:00:19.859> wanted

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
saltwater aquarium here and just wanted

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.630 
saltwater aquarium here and just wanted
to<00:00:20.189> show<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:22.100> added<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.279> chemical

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to show you before I added this chemical

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
to show you before I added this chemical
in<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.150> called<00:00:24.359> Foss<00:00:24.630> free<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.800> chemical

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
in it's called Foss free it's a chemical

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.650 
in it's called Foss free it's a chemical
that's<00:00:26.609> used<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.590> for<00:00:28.590> swimming<00:00:29.279> pools<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that's used for for swimming pools and I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
that's used for for swimming pools and I
think<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> contains<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.340> LAN

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
think it contains I want to say it's LAN

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
think it contains I want to say it's LAN
PM<00:00:32.940> chloride<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:34.079> sure<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:34.469> pronouncing

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
PM chloride not sure if I'm pronouncing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860 
PM chloride not sure if I'm pronouncing
that<00:00:35.070> correctly<00:00:35.130> even<00:00:35.640> using<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.600> correct

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that correctly even using the correct

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560 
that correctly even using the correct
name<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> chemical<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.070> before<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
name for that chemical but before the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
name for that chemical but before the
addition<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.640> fairly

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
addition of that and I was fairly

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
addition of that and I was fairly
generous<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> put<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> then

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
generous about what I put in and then

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.700 
generous about what I put in and then
afterward<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.700> used<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.120> diatom<00:00:45.660> filter<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
afterward I used a diatom filter to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.600 
afterward I used a diatom filter to
filter<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.090> precipitate<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
filter out the precipitate from it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.709 
filter out the precipitate from it
before<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> pH<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.270> rather

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
before it was the on the pH or rather

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.650 
before it was the on the pH or rather
the<00:00:55.309> phosphate<00:00:56.309> chart<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the phosphate chart it was off the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
the phosphate chart it was off the
charts<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.140> mean<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.500> dark<00:00:58.800> blue<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.760> was

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
charts I mean it was dark blue it was

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
charts I mean it was dark blue it was
really<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.570> bad<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.699> see

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
really really bad and now as you can see

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.590 
really really bad and now as you can see
I'll<00:01:03.270> hold<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.780> next<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
I'll hold it up next to it this is the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.740 
I'll hold it up next to it this is the
result<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.939> doesn't<00:01:12.240> look<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> color

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
result the it doesn't look the color

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
result the it doesn't look the color
doesn't<00:01:13.020> look<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.650> video<00:01:14.010> but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
doesn't look right in the video but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.300 
doesn't look right in the video but
basically<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.360> mean<00:01:16.049> there's<00:01:16.470> there's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
basically I mean there's there's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179 
basically I mean there's there's
basically<00:01:17.880> almost<00:01:18.210> no<00:01:18.689> phosphate<00:01:19.259> slab<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
basically almost no phosphate slab it's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.679 
basically almost no phosphate slab it's
gotta<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.640> off<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> scale<00:01:22.280> low<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gotta be off the scale low there so I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.570 
gotta be off the scale low there so I
think<00:01:24.990> I've<00:01:25.229> been<00:01:25.320> successful<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
think I've been successful in this and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
think I've been successful in this and
so<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.020> I'll<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:28.290> try<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
so from here on out I'll probably try to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.480 
so from here on out I'll probably try to
use<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.810> oil<00:01:30.810> water<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.619> something<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
use like oil water or something like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.810 
use like oil water or something like
that<00:01:32.759> maybe<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.079> aquarium<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> come

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that maybe I can get my aquarium to come

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
that maybe I can get my aquarium to come
back<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> life<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.259> neglected<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
back to life here I kind of neglected it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
back to life here I kind of neglected it
for<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> while<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.210> there's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> little

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for a while you can see there's a little

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.600 
for a while you can see there's a little
bit<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.250> some<00:01:41.250> coral<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.790> algae

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
bit of some coral and algae

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.900 
bit of some coral and algae
in<00:01:42.790> their<00:01:42.940> tiny<00:01:43.270> bit<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.920> hopefully<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.880> will

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
in their tiny bit and hopefully we will

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.420 
in their tiny bit and hopefully we will
come<00:01:46.240> back<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.750> anyways<00:01:47.680> let's<00:01:48.040> thought<00:01:48.310> I'd

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
come back so anyways let's thought I'd

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.050 
come back so anyways let's thought I'd
share<00:01:48.670> with<00:01:48.730> you<00:01:49.120> guys<00:01:49.150> one<00:01:50.050> approach<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
share with you guys one approach to to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.100 
share with you guys one approach to to
getting<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.670> know<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.060> see<00:01:55.270> it's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
getting that you know you can see it's

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.590 
getting that you know you can see it's
okay<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.280> any<00:01:58.000> questions<00:01:58.450> or
