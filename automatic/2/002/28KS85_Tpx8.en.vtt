hi it's mr. Toman today I'm going to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi it's mr. Toman today I'm going to
make<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.620> broccoli<00:00:04.620> chicken<00:00:04.879> rice<00:00:05.879> casserole

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
make a broccoli chicken rice casserole

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.070 
make a broccoli chicken rice casserole
so<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.919> two<00:00:08.340> cups<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.940> cooked<00:00:09.210> rice<00:00:09.360> so

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
so in here is two cups of cooked rice so

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.709 
so in here is two cups of cooked rice so
that<00:00:10.260> was<00:00:10.410> like<00:00:10.590> half<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.070> cup<00:00:11.309> dry<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.210> then<00:00:12.630> I

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that was like half a cup dry and then I

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.959 
that was like half a cup dry and then I
guess<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> becomes<00:00:13.440> 2<00:00:13.830> cups<00:00:14.280> once<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.759> cooked

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
guess it becomes 2 cups once it's cooked

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.740 
guess it becomes 2 cups once it's cooked
and<00:00:15.269> then<00:00:15.960> three<00:00:16.260> cups<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.740> broccoli<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.480> I

of<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.229> frying<00:01:28.229> pan<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.880> just<00:01:29.880> used<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.390> maybe

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of a frying pan I just used like maybe

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.649 
of a frying pan I just used like maybe
four<00:01:31.259> or<00:01:31.439> five<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:32.220> six<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.790> thin<00:01:33.180> cut

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
four or five or six like thin cut

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
four or five or six like thin cut
breasts<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.250> cut<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.610> into

breasts and then just cut them up into

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
breasts and then just cut them up into
little<00:01:35.970> strips<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> think<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.619> about<00:01:37.799> 4

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100

little strips so I think it's about 4
cups<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> gonna<00:01:39.869> measure<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.130> then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
