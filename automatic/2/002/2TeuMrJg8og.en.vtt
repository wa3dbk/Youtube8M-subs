00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
think about whatever and they didn't

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.009 
think about whatever and they didn't
even<00:02:09.160> do<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.340> as<00:02:09.849> far<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.329> can<00:02:10.390> see<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.989> far

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019

even do that as far as I can see so far
they<00:02:11.530> did<00:02:11.709> not<00:02:11.829> do<00:02:12.250> anything<00:02:12.579> so<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.090> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
they did not do anything so that's a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.360 
they did not do anything so that's a
huge<00:02:13.209> letdown<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.140> thought<00:02:15.040> they'd<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.340> least

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
huge letdown I thought they'd at least

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.879 
huge letdown I thought they'd at least
make<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.790> similar<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.239> raging<00:02:16.540> blast<00:02:16.780> 3<00:02:17.260> you
