00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
clips in there then you can strain it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
clips in there then you can strain it
out<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.709> don't<00:02:17.610> mind<00:02:18.030> it

it usually settles to the bottom and
when<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.230> sits<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> while<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:24.510> will<00:02:24.780> make

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
when this sits for a while it will make

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.290 
when this sits for a while it will make
its<00:02:25.350> own<00:02:25.760> mother<00:02:27.920> which<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.100> what<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:30.030> called

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
its own mother which is what it's called

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.570 
its own mother which is what it's called
the<00:02:30.840> scoby<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:33.230> helps<00:02:34.230> speed<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.920> process

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the scoby that helps speed the process

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.090 
the scoby that helps speed the process
for<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> next<00:02:36.330> batch<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> I'll<00:02:37.290> show<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
for the next batch and I'll show you it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.650 
for the next batch and I'll show you it
looks<00:02:38.310> kind<00:02:38.489> like<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.670> combo<00:02:39.000> jacobi<00:02:39.480> but

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
looks kind like a combo jacobi but

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.030 
looks kind like a combo jacobi but
there's<00:02:39.840> there's<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.590> bit<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
there's there's a little bit of a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
there's there's a little bit of a
difference<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.550> sure<00:02:41.850> what<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.269> in

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
difference I'm not sure what it is in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.440 
difference I'm not sure what it is in
the<00:02:43.019> bacteria<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:46.350> mother<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the bacteria but this is the mother and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.840 
the bacteria but this is the mother and
this<00:02:48.450> one<00:02:48.660> formed<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.080> its<00:02:49.260> own<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.489> previous

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
this one formed on its own in a previous

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.650 
this one formed on its own in a previous
batch<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> did<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:53.090> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.390> have

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
batch and so what I did was if you have

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.350 
batch and so what I did was if you have
a<00:02:54.690> mother<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.010> put<00:02:56.160> your<00:02:56.310> apples<00:02:57.150> in

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
a mother when you put your apples in

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
a mother when you put your apples in
your<00:02:57.450> honey<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.830> ahead<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.100> add

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
your honey in you can go ahead and add

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.270 
your honey in you can go ahead and add
your<00:02:59.489> mother<00:02:59.730> in<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.329> well<00:03:00.959> if<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.040> don't<00:03:02.160> have

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
your mother in as well if you don't have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.910 
your mother in as well if you don't have
a<00:03:02.400> mother<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.700> okay<00:03:03.060> it'll<00:03:03.390> make<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.690> done

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
a mother that's okay it'll make it done

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.229 
a mother that's okay it'll make it done
so<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.950> had<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.549> put<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so I had one and I put it in there and

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.360 
so I had one and I put it in there and
it<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.750> sped<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> process<00:03:07.769> up<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.980> little<00:03:08.160> bit

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it just sped the process up a little bit

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.910 
it just sped the process up a little bit
and<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.120> now<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.079> not<00:03:10.200> making<00:03:10.560> any<00:03:10.709> more

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
and so now that I'm not making any more

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440 
and so now that I'm not making any more
right<00:03:11.130> now<00:03:11.160> I'm<00:03:11.609> just<00:03:11.820> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.030> leave<00:03:12.239> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
right now I'm just going to leave this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.789 
right now I'm just going to leave this
sitting<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.959> little<00:03:13.230> bit<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.440> apple<00:03:13.709> cider

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
sitting in a little bit of apple cider

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.210 
sitting in a little bit of apple cider
vinegar<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.590> make<00:03:16.590> sure<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:17.010> stays

also an immune booster so I put a
spoonful<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.310> there<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> it

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.660 
spoonful of that in there and and it
kind<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.590> makes<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.859> taste<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.160> little<00:03:53.310> bit<00:03:53.519> like

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
kind of makes it taste a little bit like

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.110 
kind of makes it taste a little bit like
hawlucha<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.109> kids<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.590> kombucha

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
hawlucha so the kids like kombucha

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.199 
hawlucha so the kids like kombucha
and<00:03:56.660> so<00:03:56.900> they<00:03:57.019> drink<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.819> so<00:03:58.819> this<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.000> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and so they drink it and so this is the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.690 
and so they drink it and so this is the
vinegar<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.780> use<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.200> cover<00:04:00.459> my<00:04:01.459> herbs

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
vinegar that I use to cover my herbs

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.259 
vinegar that I use to cover my herbs
we're<00:04:02.030> making<00:04:02.360> vinaigrette<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:05.060> just
