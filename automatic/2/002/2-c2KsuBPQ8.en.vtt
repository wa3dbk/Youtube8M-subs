00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Good day I use and want you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.420
 Today, we are pointing to small craft 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 their minecraft server with a pieks 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 become a bip 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.190
 for example, after you get the vip 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 has bought code or him in an event 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 You won it's actually quite 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 just simply gives now for example 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 in chat a vip code and behind the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.160
 get code I have three now 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 days vip code worried and paste now yes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 Just a small test I show 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.230
 you guys that I'm a normal member 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.230
 So no vip 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 and just give me my vip code 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.559
 have received to enter and that was 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.170
 I could now say in principle again 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.620
 and I am also like ip now 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.089
 after the three days is yes then too 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.089
 it will be deleted automatically 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.260
 So you too do not need to be important 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.940
 to try this vip code to yours 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.830
 friends or whoever continues to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.380
 enter once entered 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.850
 this is invalid if so 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.430
 you 're watching my video right now 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.350
 and thinks cool now i have a pilot 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.330
 I'll just use it now 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.190
 I have to get fit myself 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.690
 Unfortunately he will disappoint you 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.780
 give back messages that this the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.660
 ip code is not valid I can 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.649
 Now just make it so short 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.479
 I just enter the vip code again 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.920
 this code parameter said here that 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.860
 it is a code 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.440
 here will be the same code again 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.100
 from the clipboard and try 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.899
 to confirm again and notice that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.250
 this code is invalid and again 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.619
 to confirm which not exactly 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.880
 For example, some have only if it is 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.789
 for example, no more clipboard 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.649
 but have tapped off and then you can 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.210
 So you stop again if you are 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.440
 maybe mistyped somewhere 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.700
 the next one is you can too 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.900
 Watch the vip features directly in game 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 For example, you receive them when he is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.470
 just how ip enters info and see 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.570
 Now everything you have a biaggi on 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.670
 our server to the current one 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:36.480
 time brings otherwise there is stop 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.480
 again a little information text 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 keep the donations we have from you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.180
 we get hold of expensive vip 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.650
 we pay the investment, of course 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.040
 directly back to the server and so 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.160
 so cover our monthly expenses 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.720
 I hope I could help you and we 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.650
 See you at the next tutorial 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.650
 Goodbye
