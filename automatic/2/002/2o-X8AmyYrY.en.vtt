00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
that well of course I have a method that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.719 
that well of course I have a method that
was<00:01:11.109> actually<00:01:11.439> discovered<00:01:11.799> by<00:01:11.829> accident<00:01:12.069> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
was actually discovered by accident the

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:13.830 
was actually discovered by accident the
second<00:01:12.969> time<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> wash<00:01:13.329> my<00:01:13.509> Jean<00:01:13.689> that's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
actually taking a shower with them I

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually taking a shower with them I
find<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.399> does<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.700> actually<00:01:16.119> makes<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.479> jeans

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
find it does it actually makes the jeans

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.230 
find it does it actually makes the jeans
not<00:01:17.020> only<00:01:17.350> clean<00:01:17.619> but<00:01:18.159> it<00:01:18.310> also<00:01:18.460> conforms<00:01:18.969> them

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
not only clean but it also conforms them

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.580 
not only clean but it also conforms them
to<00:01:19.329> your<00:01:19.450> body<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.899> makes<00:01:20.109> them<00:01:20.259> fit<00:01:20.439> you<00:01:20.560> like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
a like a second skin which actually

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.429 
a like a second skin which actually
leads<00:01:22.509> me<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.630> talk<00:01:22.869> about<00:01:22.899> something<00:01:23.229> else

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
leads me to talk about something else

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.510
