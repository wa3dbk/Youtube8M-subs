 What is there aquarium people? Fishtanktv.com, dustinsfishtanks bringing this early morning to you on a Sunday. The sun has just come there. I'm loving it! My wife was a bit up with the girl last night. She wasn't that good. We are about to have a cup of coffee. So excited! You had to show people what is going on. First of all I want to say that I feel bad for the Bengals fans and the Lions fans. Lions fans in particular, because your team was so bad for so long and you need the playoffs, and you look great on the first opening drive, and part of it. I love seeing what is going on with the Detroit Lions. Bengals, whatever ... Mike Brown is going to screw up your organization I'm sorry! But get good job in the playoffs because the Browns suck. She didn't get in. We are rooting for Denver today too. Falcons, I don't really care about that. You have to tell me what's going on. Really sexy driftwood came in. This changes everything for the 220, for me people. This is Manzanita driftwood. I am really jacked about it. Obviously don't sink. I am not doing much right at the moment, but I have a ton of it. I show you that driftwood is kind of one of those things that takes some time to really work. I mean a piece that I soaked, I had it for two years. Like this stuff, I'm going to enjoy it for a long time, but I'm looking forward to seeing all the feedback your guys have on getting this stuff sink faster. Of course I will try to cook the pieces that I like. I'm kind of overwhelmed now. I like the character of these pieces though. It is really cold, so I am not going to get my hands in the water anymore. I am curious about anyone who has a suggestion about how to connect these pieces. Because what I'm trying to do is I try to deal them like a big old branch, big old tree type. I'm curious about some techniques on that, I think maybe I wore them out. I don't know, I just mean a lot of really nice pieces, I keep my hands in here. That piece is no joke, so this really has my heart. What my plan is this: find a few of the selected pieces and get them then cook them, and then see if they can still sink. If they are large pieces, you dip end-over-end and you go from there until they sink. Then she puts it in the 220 and the nature of scape it off. I don't really have a complete plan yet. I am kind of overwhelmed because I have received so much from it. But that's really what I do, so nicely jacked about it. Got a ton of it. Lots of pieces, a lot of cool character to them! That is what I want! I think they got all these as little knots and little you know. This means cool looking over there. I do not know. If anyone has any advice, I am open to it. I am going to try and cook them, dipping and maybe with some rocks below to get them sinking. Also when I got this here I dug around and I found a couple of goldfish, but I couldn't find the big eye daddy from Cincinnati. I don't know if he's still in here or not. I didn't see him, the big bell-eyed man, but hope he is still around. I just wanted to show what's going on with that. Sunday types come a little later. I don't know what was going on aquaticjungles last night, but I appreciate all the business and we are working on some things on fishtanktv. I'm kind of pumped about that too! Life is good. Playing football is always fun and the early morning videos are always fun! That is what I do. Got a lot of driftwood. I'm being pumped. Give me your feedback about the best of the kind to build and aquascape, get to sync. Welcome, new subscribers! We're just going to keep on doing it! All these tanks have been turned upside down for a reason. It was frozen last night so if they had been upright in them with water they would probably have broken the seals, but since they were upside down the water has already been drained, so they are all good. They could be upside down all winter. A little tit bit for all of you. That's what's up!
