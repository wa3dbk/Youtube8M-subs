00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
alright going to do a quick know how to

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:17.360 
alright going to do a quick know how to
improve<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.559> performance<00:00:11.740> of<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:15.040> avid<00:00:15.900> bb7

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370 
improve the performance of your avid bb7

improve the performance of your avid bb7
brakes<00:00:19.290> now<00:00:20.290> it's<00:00:20.470> two<00:00:20.650> old<00:00:20.860> models<00:00:21.250> or<00:00:21.460> two

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
brakes now it's two old models or two

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.430 
brakes now it's two old models or two
models<00:00:22.120> the<00:00:22.990> old<00:00:23.140> model<00:00:23.700> gray<00:00:24.700> a<00:00:25.230> little<00:00:26.230> see

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
models the old model gray a little see

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.230 
models the old model gray a little see
through<00:00:26.470> window<00:00:26.890> here<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.960> wheel<00:00:29.200> is<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
through window here the wheel is a

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.380 
through window here the wheel is a
standard<00:00:31.660> wheel<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.500> little<00:00:32.559> smaller<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
standard wheel a little smaller the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.619 
standard wheel a little smaller the
newer<00:00:34.570> model<00:00:35.079> has<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.290> much<00:00:35.559> bigger<00:00:35.800> wheel

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
newer model has a much bigger wheel

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.970 
newer model has a much bigger wheel
which<00:00:37.629> supposedly<00:00:38.140> operates<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:38.769> little

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
which supposedly operates a little

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.099 
which supposedly operates a little
easier<00:00:39.309> but<00:00:39.600> that's<00:00:40.600> debatable<00:00:42.929> the<00:00:43.929> newer

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
easier but that's debatable the newer

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.009 
easier but that's debatable the newer
model<00:00:44.469> also<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:45.070> outer<00:00:45.429> wheel<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.989> a

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
model also the outer wheel there's a

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.110 
model also the outer wheel there's a
little<00:00:47.140> different<00:00:47.530> more<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.609> star<00:00:48.850> shapes

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
little different more of a star shapes

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.750 
little different more of a star shapes
of<00:00:49.390> around<00:00:49.659> I<00:00:49.960> kind<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:50.920> preferred<00:00:51.219> around<00:00:51.550> in

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
of around I kind of preferred around in

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.569 
of around I kind of preferred around in
the<00:00:51.850> old<00:00:51.999> ones<00:00:52.269> but<00:00:52.510> blah<00:00:53.350> blah<00:00:53.559> blah<00:00:53.769> that's

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
the old ones but blah blah blah that's

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.380 
the old ones but blah blah blah that's
life<00:00:54.850> I<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.659> like<00:00:55.989> this<00:00:56.109> new<00:00:56.319> little<00:00:56.499> window<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
life I do like this new little window we

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.129 
life I do like this new little window we
can<00:00:58.449> see<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.780> brake<00:00:58.960> pads<00:01:00.929> doesn't<00:01:01.929> really

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.139 
can see the brake pads doesn't really

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.200 
can see the brake pads doesn't really
help<00:01:02.499> a<00:01:02.679> lot<00:01:02.859> because<00:01:03.219> you<00:01:03.399> can't<00:01:03.670> they're

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
help a lot because you can't they're

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.170 
help a lot because you can't they're
really<00:01:04.479> hard<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.780> see<00:01:05.050> in<00:01:05.199> there<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
really hard to see in there but the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.749 
really hard to see in there but the
other<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.460> basically<00:01:09.460> what<00:01:09.640> we're

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
other is to it basically what we're

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.990 
other is to it basically what we're
going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.939> do<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:10.840> when<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.200> operate<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:12.000> if

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
going to do is when you operate this if

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.480 
going to do is when you operate this if
you<00:01:13.119> look<00:01:13.329> really<00:01:13.600> close<00:01:14.170> right<00:01:14.439> there<00:01:14.710> you

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
you look really close right there you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.060 
you look really close right there you
see<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.729> little<00:01:15.939> silver<00:01:16.210> piston<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.890> already

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
see a little silver piston I've already

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.359 
see a little silver piston I've already
cleaned<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:21.810> testing<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> but<00:01:23.829> if<00:01:24.039> that

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
cleaned this one testing it but if that

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.260 
cleaned this one testing it but if that
gets<00:01:24.700> all<00:01:24.909> gunky<00:01:25.829> we<00:01:26.829> brake<00:01:27.130> dust<00:01:27.369> dirt<00:01:27.789> blah

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
gets all gunky we brake dust dirt blah

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.200 
gets all gunky we brake dust dirt blah
blah<00:01:28.539> blah<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.430> actually<00:01:30.789> lower<00:01:31.000> their

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
blah blah you can actually lower their

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.520 
blah blah you can actually lower their
performance<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.810> break<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.200> make<00:01:32.289> it<00:01:32.409> very

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
performance you break and make it very

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.139 
performance you break and make it very
difficult<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:33.100> stop<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.740> pretty<00:01:36.670> much<00:01:36.789> do

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
difficult to stop it I pretty much do

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.550 
difficult to stop it I pretty much do
this<00:01:37.859> yeah<00:01:38.859> once<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.430> year<00:01:39.609> or<00:01:39.789> so<00:01:40.000> ago<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:41.530> I

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
this yeah once a year or so ago when I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.690 
this yeah once a year or so ago when I
clean<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.070> now<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.020> one<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.520> lot

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
clean it now on this one it's a lot

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
clean it now on this one it's a lot
harder<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:47.140> eola<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.920> i<00:01:47.979> highly<00:01:48.159> recommend

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
harder on eola and i highly recommend

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.620 
harder on eola and i highly recommend
not<00:01:50.500> doing<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.219> extent<00:01:51.579> that<00:01:51.850> i<00:01:52.270> do<00:01:52.390> on

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
not doing it to the extent that i do on

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.100 
not doing it to the extent that i do on
these<00:01:52.810> on<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.649> newer<00:01:53.829> ones
