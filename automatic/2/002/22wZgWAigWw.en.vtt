00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.430
 hola que tal welcome back to your 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 channel code jon and good remember that 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.660
 this is a specialized channel 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.850
 only in programming but this one goes 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.890
 to be a unique case and now better not 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.930
 will repeat because they are only going to be 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.340
 programming videos but I want 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.840
 clarify that in this almost a month of 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.550
 absence 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.860
 there has been a problem that has been 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.530
 invading good that no longer thanks to 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.410
 god and good is the happy blue screen 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.060
 of death yes and if you do not know it then 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.480
 I invite you to see the reality of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.160
 windows 8.1 and windows 8 and several at 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.530
 better operating systems that I do not 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.100
 I want to put in that no and well I want 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.170
 I invite you to check that this 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.629
 video that you know more about the problem that 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.190
 you investigate as much as I did because 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.050
 as I comment this video is going to be a 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.239
 tutorial a mini tutorial of how 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 solve it or how do I solve this 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.250
 video this problem sorry since I already 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.920
 I had seen thousands of videos I saw several 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.829
 comments of solutions and I know even 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.350
 You gave a late check all all all 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.470
 the plane of everything and nothing did not work 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.210
 I went to microsoft forums download a 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.670
 program that is called blue string for 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.160
 see the data of what would be the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.720
 problem or the origin of the problem that 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.550
 I was generating what and nothing 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.050
 they automatically generated nothing from me 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.820
 solutions 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.800
 and well nothing this after having 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.480
 I tried so hard to find the solution 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.970
 with this program that I'm going to open it to 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.080
 then it's called booster raid or 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.960
 buster this this video what does this 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.450
 driver what he does forgiveness is to update 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.330
 of your computer's drivers 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.670
 since this time is the option with which 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.909
 I was guided and it worked, it has not given me 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.740
 problems in nothing 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.780
 and automatically when you download it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.619
 you have to have it full obviously for 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.450
 you run it completely free 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.939
 you can see in a separate video tutorial 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.819
 well for you to have it once 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.490
 do not download it will give you the whole list of 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.590
 drivers and devices that come 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 obsolete a little obsolete means and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.729
 that you can modify them so that you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.470
 install them or even getting into the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.899
 official page of your computer that is 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
 h for the table hp pavilion is a hp 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.799
 pavilion and there you can also download the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.540
 drivers not what you need but to me 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.840
 this software works for me I know 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.190
 I recommend lowers use it cinnamon and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.190
 they will see that they do not have to change 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.780
 automatically nothing your computer will 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.870
 can update is updated 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.459
 automatically normally and it does not pass 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 nothing do not the blue screen appears 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.210
 of death I assure you once that 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830
 Do this 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.170
 Do it with time because if you 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.970
 they update everything I do not do it because 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.520
 it does not give me problems in anything so 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.590
 I better not move it once they do 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.870
 do it with time because you will mention that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.480
 the driver downloads them since the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.190
 install rules your computer but it's 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.670
 quite effective leaves it completely 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.550
 good and I want to thank the people who 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.860
 has subscribed during this period of 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.900
 time that is almost three months that 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.730
 we call for 200 subscribers it's not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.490
 both compared to other channels of 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.960
 of youtube but good is a project that 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.400
 little by little it is growing thanks to 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.590
 you see the people who have given you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.080
 hand up the videos that have 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.230
 shared etcetera etcetera not to the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.580
 good and bad suggestions are also 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.440
 welcome we accept them with pleasure 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.720
 and good that we also have them 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.380
 commented on the videos of another language 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.300
 of programming my partner cindy has 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.970
 been helping with a bit of that but 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.680
 as I was saying 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.440
 we have problems to raise also the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.060
 videos and we stopped the project a bit 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.980
 but we're already here back if god 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
 want we also have what are the

 again the tutorials not that can be 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.110
 correspond to this language of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.240
 programming that is more more I did for the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.800
 moment and good nothing see you in the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.660
 next video and the next one is going to be 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.090
 of programming and we will continue 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.340
 talking about the issues that we have 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.330
 I know that they are the pointers and we are going to 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.030
 start what are the lists 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.980
 linked thanks for watching this video 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.730
