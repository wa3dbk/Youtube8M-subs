00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that you can't do yet because it's only

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.350 
that you can't do yet because it's only
20%<00:02:13.500> chance<00:02:13.680> success<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.090> only<00:02:15.180> have

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
20% chance success because you only have

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
one 6:15 eye level guy but if you get

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150 
one 6:15 eye level guy but if you get
three<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.390> 6:15<00:02:18.960> gradually<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:19.980> least

three of them to 6:15 gradually at least

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.620 
three of them to 6:15 gradually at least
have<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> higher<00:02:20.580> chance<00:02:20.880> when<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.390> quest

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
have a higher chance when that quest

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.960 
have a higher chance when that quest
does<00:02:21.870> come<00:02:22.050> out<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.770> quests<00:02:23.160> only

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
