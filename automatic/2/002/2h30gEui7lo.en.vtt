00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:42.639 
town table or the of it so it's
basically<00:00:30.390> made<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:32.329> ceiling<00:00:33.329> tiles<00:00:37.520> and

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.420 

styrofoam<00:00:43.649> rocks

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.720 

so<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:50.060> going<00:00:50.330> to<00:00:50.390> make<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.350> model<00:00:52.100> model<00:00:52.550> our

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
so it's going to make a model model our

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.310 
so it's going to make a model model our
tape<00:00:52.970> tearing<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:54.680> here<00:00:55.370> there<00:00:56.180> we<00:00:56.360> can<00:00:56.540> put<00:00:56.840> a

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
tape tearing the here there we can put a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.270 
tape tearing the here there we can put a
black<00:00:57.920> mouth<00:00:58.280> or<00:00:58.550> something<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.150> represent

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
black mouth or something to represent

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.850 
black mouth or something to represent
the<00:01:01.280> gap<00:01:01.790> for<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.660> bottomless<00:01:03.470> pit<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:05.860> so

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
the gap for the bottomless pit and so

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.710 
the gap for the bottomless pit and so
because<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:07.910> gap<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:09.530> allows<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.720> make

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
because of that gap it allows to make

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.100 
because of that gap it allows to make
the<00:01:11.870> board<00:01:12.140> bigger<00:01:12.470> or<00:01:12.800> smaller<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:14.270> just

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
the board bigger or smaller just just

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.670 
the board bigger or smaller just just
out<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.470> widen<00:01:16.100> or<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:17.360> gap<00:01:17.600> or<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:21.470> make

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
out to widen or the gap or and to make

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.660 
out to widen or the gap or and to make
more<00:01:22.040> bridges<00:01:22.990> could<00:01:23.990> put<00:01:24.229> some<00:01:24.670> some

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
more bridges could put some some

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.710 
more bridges could put some some
shouting<00:01:25.970> rocks<00:01:26.390> from<00:01:27.140> there<00:01:28.420> please<00:01:29.420> make<00:01:29.690> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
shouting rocks from there please make it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:46.389 
shouting rocks from there please make it
bigger<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.320> with<00:01:30.920> more<00:01:31.190> more<00:01:31.820> bridges<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.890> the

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
bigger in with more more bridges so the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.290 
bigger in with more more bridges so the
cat<00:01:46.670> got<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.860> got<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.250> broke<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.700> few<00:01:50.030> piece

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
cat got in got in and broke a few piece

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.820 
cat got in got in and broke a few piece
of<00:01:50.860> boards<00:01:51.860> but<00:01:52.720> because<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:53.899> double<00:01:54.619> down

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
of boards but because it's double down

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.609 
of boards but because it's double down
think<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.700> just<00:01:56.509> makes<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.929> more<00:01:57.140> interesting

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
think it just makes it more interesting

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.290 
think it just makes it more interesting
so<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.160> might<00:01:59.020> add<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.050> feature<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.830> other

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
so I might add that feature to other

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:16.070 
so I might add that feature to other
platform<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.539> break<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.590> few<00:02:03.950> more<00:02:04.100> pieces

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.550
