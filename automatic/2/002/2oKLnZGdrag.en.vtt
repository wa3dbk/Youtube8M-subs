00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it goes into the contraption which is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.110 
it goes into the contraption which is
called<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.199> gin<00:00:31.470> fest<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.220> basically<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.970> is

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
called a gin fest and basically this is

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760 
called a gin fest and basically this is
like<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.300> vise<00:00:33.629> that<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> handle

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
like a vise that is your in the handle

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.640 
like a vise that is your in the handle
it<00:00:35.000> clamps<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> place<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.199> you<00:00:37.320> bring<00:00:37.470> this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
it clamps it in place and you bring this

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.740 
it clamps it in place and you bring this
part<00:00:37.920> down<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.220> is<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> stopper<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
part down which is the stopper and the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
part down which is the stopper and the
stopper<00:00:40.170> forms<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> ball<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.340> battle

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
stopper forms the ball or your battle

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.939 
stopper forms the ball or your battle
would<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.410> kind<00:00:46.769> of<00:00:46.800> keep

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
would go so then you just kind of keep

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.549 
would go so then you just kind of keep
it<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.430> hole<00:00:47.850> held<00:00:48.629> together<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.199> it's<00:00:49.290> kind<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it a hole held together and it's kind of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
it a hole held together and it's kind of
chuckled<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.220> excess<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> hand

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
chuckled that excess and with a hand

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
chuckled that excess and with a hand
stopper<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.129> finger<00:00:53.519> smooth<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
stopper and your finger smooth out the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
stopper and your finger smooth out the
inside<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.809> want<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.409> rid<00:00:58.619> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
inside and you just want to get rid of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
inside and you just want to get rid of
any<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.339> little<00:00:59.549> lines<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.659> may

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
any kind of little lines that you may

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
any kind of little lines that you may
have<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> inside<00:01:01.799> if<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.129> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
have on the inside if you have some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
have on the inside if you have some
creases<00:01:02.549> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> clay<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.110> nice

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
creases you can just as a clay as nice

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.539 
creases you can just as a clay as nice
and<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.070> smooth<00:01:05.430> them

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and right now you can just smooth them

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.090 
and right now you can just smooth them
out<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.350> step<00:01:07.590> all

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
out and that's like the first step all

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
out and that's like the first step all
right<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> second<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.030> you've<00:01:09.150> got<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
right the second but then you've got to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
right the second but then you've got to
pass<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.750> wire<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.409> right<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> center

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
pass your wire just right to the center

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
pass your wire just right to the center
of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> ball<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> burst

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of the ball and you don't want to burst

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.940 
of the ball and you don't want to burst
it<00:01:15.860> there<00:01:16.860> any<00:01:17.070> lines<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.119> good

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
it there any lines there and that's good

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
it there any lines there and that's good
this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.040> where<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.490> horribly<00:01:20.790> wrong

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this is where I can go horribly wrong

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
this is where I can go horribly wrong
you<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> steady<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> disaster

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you don't have a steady how you disaster

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
you don't have a steady how you disaster
yeah<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.290> thread<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> right

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
yeah so you just want to thread it right

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
yeah so you just want to thread it right
up<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> center<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.210> extra

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
up the center and that's just what extra

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.170 
up the center and that's just what extra
practice<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.830> see<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> little

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
practice you can kind of see a little

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.399 
practice you can kind of see a little
bit<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.329> metal<00:01:30.600> coming<00:01:30.749> out<00:01:30.960> through<00:01:31.170> there

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
bit of metal coming out through there

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.620 
bit of metal coming out through there
now<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.179> give<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
now if you want to give it a bit of a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.060 
now if you want to give it a bit of a
twist<00:01:33.840> otherwise<00:01:34.229> sometimes<00:01:34.469> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.829> block

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
twist otherwise sometimes you can block

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
twist otherwise sometimes you can block
it<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.609> pull<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:35.820> back<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:37.079> all

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it up as you pull it back and that's all

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.529 
it up as you pull it back and that's all
I<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.619> show<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.979> today<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.119> did<00:01:39.359> them

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
I can show you today but you did them

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.179 
I can show you today but you did them
kind<00:01:39.749> of<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.929> batches<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.409> I've<00:01:40.740> done<00:01:40.950> there

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
kind of in batches like I've done there

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
kind of in batches like I've done there
and<00:01:41.429> like<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.329> following<00:01:42.539> day<00:01:42.899> you'll<00:01:43.079> trim

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and like the following day you'll trim

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380 
and like the following day you'll trim
this<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.679> part<00:01:44.130> off<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> then<00:01:45.240> you'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this little part off and then you'll

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.779 
this little part off and then you'll
press<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.899> whatever<00:01:46.229> design<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> decide<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
press on whatever design you decide to

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.749 
press on whatever design you decide to
use<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.719> they're<00:01:49.049> ready<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.560> sanding<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
use and they're ready now for sanding so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
use and they're ready now for sanding so
once<00:01:51.600> you're<00:01:51.780> completely<00:01:52.140> dry<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
once you're completely dry like this you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.169 
once you're completely dry like this you
smooth<00:01:53.249> them<00:01:53.429> down<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.759> steel<00:01:54.090> wool

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
smooth them down with some steel wool

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.270 
smooth them down with some steel wool
just<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.109> rid<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> rough<00:01:55.710> edges<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
just get rid of all the rough edges and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.469 
just get rid of all the rough edges and
then<00:01:56.460> they're<00:01:56.609> going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.969> Kellum<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.389> be

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
then they're going to the Kellum to be

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
then they're going to the Kellum to be
made<00:01:57.659> hard<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.679> when<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:58.889> come<00:01:59.039> out<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.249> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
made hard so when they come out of the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.870 
made hard so when they come out of the
kill<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.609> then<00:01:59.729> they're<00:01:59.909> quite<00:02:00.450> solid<00:02:00.990> like

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
kill and then they're quite solid like

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.429 
kill and then they're quite solid like
you've<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:02.999> a<00:02:03.030> finished<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.659> met<00:02:03.899> yeah<00:02:04.289> this

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you've got a finished one met yeah this

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
you've got a finished one met yeah this
one<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.619> no<00:02:04.829> design<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:05.969> see

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
one is no design but you can kind of see

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.960 
one is no design but you can kind of see
you<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.530> tough<00:02:07.829> enough<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.460> know<00:02:08.850> at

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you know it's tough enough you know at

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
you know it's tough enough you know at
this<00:02:09.090> stage<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.259> they're<00:02:10.470> fired<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.459> 12

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this stage so they're fired like for 12

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.930 
this stage so they're fired like for 12
hours<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.160> don't<00:02:14.459> use<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> kill

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
hours and I know I don't use to kill

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
hours and I know I don't use to kill
them<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.420> anymore<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.190> have

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
them like this anymore but you can have

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.440 
them like this anymore but you can have
this<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.610> probably<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.970> better<00:02:18.150> picture

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
this is probably a better picture

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
this is probably a better picture
together<00:02:18.840> give<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> an<00:02:19.410> idea<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.920> how<00:02:20.370> they

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
together give you an idea of how they

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
together give you an idea of how they
were<00:02:20.700> done<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:22.200> were<00:02:22.319> baked<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.740> these

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
were done with they were baked in these

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.370 
were done with they were baked in these
big<00:02:23.040> pottery<00:02:23.430> containers<00:02:23.910> now<00:02:24.060> sagres<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
big pottery containers now sagres and I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140 
big pottery containers now sagres and I
could<00:02:25.560> kill<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> size<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.580> hold<00:02:26.819> up<00:02:27.090> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
could kill it the size could hold up to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.140 
could kill it the size could hold up to
10,000<00:02:28.050> pipes<00:02:28.230> at<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> firing<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:30.060> were

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
10,000 pipes at a firing and there were

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.190 
10,000 pipes at a firing and there were
seven<00:02:30.569> cones<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
seven cones in the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900 
seven cones in the
village<00:02:31.440> imitator<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.580> they're<00:02:32.700> making

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
village imitator so they're making

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.220 
village imitator so they're making
millions<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.750> men<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.200> millions<00:02:36.230> they

said you have to have it on you slowly
built<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.560> off<00:02:58.650> probably<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:59.099> couple<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.370> hours

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
built it off probably a couple of hours

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.380 
built it off probably a couple of hours
and<00:02:59.880> then<00:03:00.000> let<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.440> another<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.950> least

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
and then let it go for another at least

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.720 
and then let it go for another at least
1012<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:03.750> total<00:03:04.400> when<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.610> should

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
probably take a day to cool before you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.750 
probably take a day to cool before you
could<00:03:07.260> touch<00:03:07.440> anything<00:03:07.769> attached<00:03:08.160> at<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.489> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
then there's a great big basket behind

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.539 
then there's a great big basket behind
you<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:12.209> was<00:03:12.390> called<00:03:12.660> fish<00:03:13.280> that's<00:03:14.280> how<00:03:14.489> they

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
you that was called fish that's how they

transported the pipes now a little bit

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.460 
transported the pipes now a little bit
they're<00:03:17.970> possible<00:03:18.540> as<00:03:18.630> well<00:03:18.810> as<00:03:18.959> exciting<00:03:19.349> by

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
they're possible as well as exciting by

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.350 
they're possible as well as exciting by
rail<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:19.769> shit<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.849> when<00:03:20.970> you're<00:03:21.120> going
