00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:15.109
 Hello beekeepers and welcome to a new video of Eifel Gold 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 Today I want to show you in a short video how easy it is one 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 Prey, consisting of an open grid floor and frames for bee colonies 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.730
 with a little manual skill to make your own 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.609
 Everything you see here I have taken from this book and in 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.860
 Self-test tested. So have fun with the replica! 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.460
 So then let's go before that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.080
 Build the grid floor to take a quick look at the bill of material 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.650
 This is all going fast here but in the end I will again 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.000
 Show a complete list a bit longer 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 So, first we build a frame from the 2 blue shown 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.220
 upper longitudinal strips and the upper transverse strip (black) 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.480
 this is the crossbar for the rear pliers area 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.300
 and the over cross bar, here yellow for the Fluglochseite 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.550
 and you see directly 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.340
 on the flight hole side, the upper cross bar is 2cm narrower 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 exactly this difference is then later the flight hole. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 Then we can turn the frame and on the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.630
 Bottom of the frame 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.960
 nailing the wire mesh for the grid floor 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.670
 and also the underside of the flight hole is shown here on the blue 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.010
 Sidebars firmly mounted 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020
 The next step is self-explanatory, I'm not saying it now 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.100
 much more. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.710
 The purpose of this attachment of the strips is, 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.770
 that afterwards also in the back gap a Gemüllschublade 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.100
 can insert 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.599
 for the Varroa diagnosis 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.810
 Then we come now to the assembly of the frame and look 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.669
 on the material list. Shown in yellow 2 side panels 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.379
 Two inches thick is the whole material 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.529
 Two front boards for front and back 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:36.469
 The green handle bar to hold, red the top bar and in 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:41.379
 5 mm thickness the black skid rails 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.680
 The side panels and the frontal boards are screwed together dull 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.439
 and glued as desired 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.199
 As you can see, the front boards are a bit shorter than the side panels 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.319
 This is the bearing surface for the 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.789
 Frames and throat. 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:04.289
 The handle bars are then placed in front, then hide the 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:08.519
 decided bearing surface also everything screwed or floating down 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.169
 glued 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:16.279
 then down to the hand on the heart afforded because the whole was 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.299
 Just a little bit of refinement can I show you right away 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.659
 and 2 good final are only for the time being 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.999
 Feichten then that the whole does not instantly slip red pen Dr slips on 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 Child support and here you should make sure that you failed from 810 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.999
 so I sat down again the frivolous number charged myself 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.369
 the possible improvement of the whole one can afford the gap and the 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.139
 Essays play a role in that 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.589
 Angels quenching so that all after 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:54.019
 a piece of freedom practicable 10% have the care contract influences 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.309
 is exposed at the bottom of the hand 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:01.349
 to essays would be then accumulating rainwater and speculation 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.109
 From the very beginning I personally conclude and not on the 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.879
 Collect essays bar and become a term he has these disposals 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.669
 Cooling makes you really nice with partitions with your fingers 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.319
 may intervene 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.340
 down to one and also lock accordingly 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.029
 good is changed 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.240
 the easiest way is to decline 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.919
 Red Bulls delivers 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.809
 for two Donat St 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:36.809
 These regulations come with variably adjustable seats 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.379
 with their services 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.860
 that also needed in the north and Baltic Sea 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.080
 Fri and fast 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240
 really good is natural 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.639
 we know 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.509
 to perform the mass 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.469
 Keith Jarrett could at one go make quite a star forced action federal judge 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.080
 actually whole lot 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 To hunt material at once through rough Zacher rough times can be so 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.900
 With a machine like this, a spy of Bündner's office is again very well 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.870
 Practical machine I have now here you only see the functional 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.150
 insertable 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.099
 maybe just a little trick under her 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.229
 I did not really care for the final assembly with it 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.169
 should 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.210
 constructively crafted together what you then the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.539
 Percent finished sidewalls can attach around it with screw clamps 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.400
 to carry around with it 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.400
 when assembling every 200 angles that are brought to one another 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.519
 he created you had fun and i was able to give you a bit of z construction 

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.389
 Just bring Hohenheimer closer today 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.979
 dare and do not write any witchcraft orders because he enjoys it 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.009
 I would be happy if he found the video liked too 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.590
 According to the percent I am in the comments what better done 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.210
 could be 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.629
 Euro 1 otherwise until next time here on the video channel
