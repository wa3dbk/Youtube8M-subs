relaxing<00:00:34.570> using<00:00:35.350> your<00:00:35.470> wrist<00:00:35.800> instead<00:00:36.220> of

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
relaxing using your wrist instead of

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.100 
relaxing using your wrist instead of
just<00:00:36.489> your<00:00:36.580> arm<00:00:36.850> like<00:00:37.059> that<00:00:37.300> when<00:00:37.960> you're

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
doing this kind of stuff because it's

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.190 
doing this kind of stuff because it's
pretty<00:00:40.059> technical<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:40.690> it's<00:00:40.780> pretty<00:00:40.960> fast

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
pretty technical and it's pretty fast

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.229 
pretty technical and it's pretty fast
drumming<00:00:41.469> so<00:00:41.680> you're<00:00:41.800> gonna<00:00:41.890> need<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.309> be<00:00:42.730> have

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
a really relaxed technique when you do

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.889 
a really relaxed technique when you do
this<00:00:45.070> let<00:00:45.280> me<00:00:45.370> um<00:00:45.579> just<00:00:46.300> give<00:00:46.450> you<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.660> little

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
this let me um just give you a little

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.930 
this let me um just give you a little
example<00:00:47.590> of<00:00:47.710> what<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.309> kind<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.610> strumming

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
example of what this kind of strumming

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.819 
example of what this kind of strumming
sounds<00:00:49.510> like<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.899> then<00:00:50.379> I'll<00:00:50.620> explain

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
sounds like and then I'll explain

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:07.190 
sounds like and then I'll explain
exactly<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:51.730> I'm<00:00:51.850> doing<00:00:52.090> okay

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.260 

now<00:01:08.200> as<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.500> can<00:01:08.619> see<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.190> pretty<00:01:09.610> quick

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
now as you can see this is pretty quick

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.609 
now as you can see this is pretty quick
strong<00:01:10.630> it's<00:01:10.869> pretty<00:01:11.080> fast<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.470> pretty

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
strong it's pretty fast it's pretty

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.170 
strong it's pretty fast it's pretty
technical<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.490> won't<00:01:12.790> want<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:12.970> use<00:01:13.090> this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
technical and you won't want to use this

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.700 
technical and you won't want to use this
all<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> time<00:01:13.630> because<00:01:13.810> you<00:01:14.170> know<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.350> could

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
all the time because you know you could

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.170 
all the time because you know you could
burn<00:01:15.070> your<00:01:15.250> audience<00:01:15.580> your<00:01:15.700> listener<00:01:16.000> out<00:01:16.060> on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
burn your audience your listener out on

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.240 
burn your audience your listener out on
it<00:01:16.300> but<00:01:16.479> if<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.020> throw<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.380> in<00:01:17.470> every<00:01:17.890> now<00:01:18.070> and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
it but if you throw it in every now and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.950 
it but if you throw it in every now and
then<00:01:18.340> it's<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.640> really<00:01:19.150> cool<00:01:19.300> weapon<00:01:19.659> in<00:01:19.810> it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
then it's a really cool weapon in it's

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.630 
then it's a really cool weapon in it's
pretty<00:01:20.170> flashy<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.770> pretty<00:01:21.040> impressive<00:01:21.220> too

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
pretty flashy it's pretty impressive too

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.890 
pretty flashy it's pretty impressive too
so<00:01:21.850> basically<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.479> just<00:01:22.509> play<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> quick

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
so basically you just play a quick

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.510 
so basically you just play a quick
thirty-second<00:01:23.830> note<00:01:23.920> triplet<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.400> is

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
thirty-second note triplet this is

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.510 
thirty-second note triplet this is
slowed<00:01:24.759> way<00:01:24.909> down<00:01:24.940> for<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.479> pretty<00:01:25.659> much

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
slowed way down for you pretty much

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.210 
slowed way down for you pretty much
and<00:01:27.640> then<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.270> follow<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.690> up<00:01:28.840> just<00:01:29.680> going

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and then you follow it up just going

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.680 
and then you follow it up just going
into<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.610> regular<00:01:30.909> sixteenth<00:01:31.299> note<00:01:31.510> strumming

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
into a regular sixteenth note strumming

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.730 
into a regular sixteenth note strumming
pattern

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.190 

so<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.520> example<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.180> we<00:01:37.270> have<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.780> going<00:01:38.140> to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
so the example that we have is going to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.020 
so the example that we have is going to
be<00:01:38.290> just<00:01:38.799> an<00:01:38.890> E<00:01:39.040> chord<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.670> quick

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
be just an E chord and quick

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.180 
be just an E chord and quick
thirty-second<00:01:40.750> note<00:01:40.920> triplet<00:01:41.920> stronger

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
thirty-second note triplet stronger

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.060 
thirty-second note triplet stronger
fatter<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.490> then<00:01:42.670> right<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.320> regular<00:01:44.650> 16

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
fatter and then right in to a regular 16

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.740 
fatter and then right in to a regular 16
note<00:01:45.310> strumming<00:01:45.550> pattern<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.540> what

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
note strumming pattern so here is what

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.390 
note strumming pattern so here is what
the<00:01:46.900> example<00:01:47.200> sounds<00:01:47.650> like

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.210 

I<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:57.050> tough<00:01:57.320> part<00:01:57.590> about<00:01:57.650> strumming<00:01:58.010> like

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
I the tough part about strumming like

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.980 
I the tough part about strumming like
this<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.520> obviously<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:59.450> speed<00:01:59.750> but<00:01:59.960> you

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
this is obviously the speed but you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.870 
this is obviously the speed but you
don't<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.890> be<00:02:01.010> going<00:02:01.190> really<00:02:01.580> at<00:02:01.850> a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
don't have to be going really at a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.280 
don't have to be going really at a
really<00:02:02.120> fast<00:02:02.270> tempo<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.660> do<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.200> you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
really fast tempo to do this and you

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.420 
really fast tempo to do this and you
don't<00:02:03.440> even<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.800> use<00:02:03.920> thirty-second

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
don't even have to use thirty-second
