00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 It may sound like a joke but it's true. 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.480
 buy a pc with no operating system installed on it with software that 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.839
 control the nets can be a good deal 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.839
 besides, you save money 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.960
 you can install the apple operating system on any pc with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 This is the first requirement for 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380
 reactors work 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.880
 but before explaining how all this is done we consulted a lawyer for 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 know how far this action is legal 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.780
 and guess what you found 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.050
 from the point of view of consumer law 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.060
 there is no illegality 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.620
 in installing software to give 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.460
 on a pc computer 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.219
 since he today that legally 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 and loose right 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 so we're not talking about a pirate copy 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.569
 on top of a hill installed on the pc 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:56.990
 it's not a bit 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.110
 you do not have a violation 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.160
 because it can be considered 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 it's a requirement of law 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.200
 impersonal allows software to be installed on the court 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.120
 it's an abusive practice 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.410
 also called a married sale 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.310
 here when you consume 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.939
 the supply of a product or service 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.939
 acquisition of another product or service 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.110
 has this same even though the end user user end user license it 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.409
 can not be accused of piracy or any other illegal act 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.439
 It is more than that 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.380
 at the time the idea 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 published by the Consumer Protection Code to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 support and updates of the operating system installed on any 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 machine including on ps 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.800
 I'm going with this support, we can start transforming our guide. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.510
 in this political opening than the last operational system of the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.840
 apple is next to psd 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.850
 there are softwares 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.310
 these past scenes 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.410
 it is not necessary that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.160
 level of programming with that nÃ© 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.200
 only access one reading a search for in the ovens 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.329
 the tutorial used by it does not require any programming experience 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.670
 begins 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.720
 whoever hears us guarantees that it is even easier to install than the latest version 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.589
 from windows 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.349
 the method was developed and tested to be used in any text 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.540
 developer with the latest generation intel 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.089
 the cutting of three ict pools 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.099
 but there are people who have also been able to run on micros as huck cords and 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.099
 Until then, do not try a room. 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.150
 besides the computer you will need to dvd originally the excess oil 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.019
 from a blank cd 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.260
 air is important also have a certain amount of clear patience 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.729
 if you follow the steps 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.149
 according to a real contact and use the right tools 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.389
 the human do not believe that most people will not encounter problem 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.769
 and his rival 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.069
 if everything works out also in the new encounter problem 5 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.239
 before beginning pay attention to the following steps 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.530
 leave at most 4 gb of RAM in the machine 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.670
 remove the rest left to reinstall at the end of the operation 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.849
 today only for a video card and make sure it is on the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.049
 first available sewer to remove any HP other than Olympus and 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.709
 you plan to install in the Midwest 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.909
 disconnect any peripheral other than the keyboard and mouse 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.319
 you will need them always remember to always back up your files before 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.599
 to start messing with your hd 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.529
 after these first steps you need to make some modifications 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.339
 simple ships your computer to restart it with the boot cd you 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:56.300
 will record the boot parent 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.940
 from there it is just to run the original apple dvd and install the new 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.329
 operational system 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.869
 as in a magic trick you will have a mac voting the body of a prison 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029
 all 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.049
 last step before starting to use your new machine is to install a lot 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:15.600
 of people 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.940
 this program will be easy and practical to do all the configuration of the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.409
 your computer so that everything works perfectly 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.409
 the internet video audio costumes and everything else 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.430
 if you think we're out of date there comes the last pass 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.780
 to install a larger the latest version of the apple operating system you 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.499
 need to see them in my already installed room 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:45.419
 as you will already have in medical practice your front but tabajara the new star of the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.490
 application store normally installed 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.610
 was like this 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.979
 compatibility issue 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.889
 companies will have few software 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.499
 the own assis 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:56.389
 the cnpma had been accessed 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.319
 the reason is the same thing the only thing in common 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.319
 it's being bought sÃ£o paulo 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.830
 you may ask yourself 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.870
 all this work just to run the operating system 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.550
 good addition to the experience make this installation little money you can 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.430
 buy your new friend with no installed operating system of the time being 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.580
 much less to install mac is not if you spend 79 reais buying software 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.919
 in the apple store 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.300
 if you want to install laio the latest version add to this 79 reais plus 30 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.830
 dollars, something around fifty reais or one hundred and thirty reals 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.940
 Do you have a system? 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.490
 complete the original is less than you would spend buying windows that 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.440
 leaves about four hundred reais and then experience the adventures you 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.170
