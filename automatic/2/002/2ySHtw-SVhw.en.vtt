00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
for durability so you're going to use it

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.120 
for durability so you're going to use it
on<00:00:09.870> surfaces<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:11.250> chairs<00:00:12.650> front<00:00:13.650> outdoor

on surfaces like chairs front outdoor
furniture<00:00:15.139> molding<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.379> trim<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.250> doors<00:00:17.750> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
furniture molding and trim and doors so

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
furniture molding and trim and doors so
areas<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:20.060> have<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.869> tendency<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.130> bumped

good wash ability you know that's where

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.770 
good wash ability you know that's where
you're<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> find<00:00:31.890> enamel<00:00:32.309> paints

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
you're going to find enamel paints

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.470 
you're going to find enamel paints
enamel<00:00:33.780> paints<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.260> formulated<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> have

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
enamel paints are formulated you have

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.090 
enamel paints are formulated you have
water-based<00:00:36.480> enamel<00:00:37.320> paints<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
water-based enamel paints and then you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
water-based enamel paints and then you
have<00:00:38.309> oil-based<00:00:38.940> enamel<00:00:39.120> paints<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.629> well

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
have oil-based enamel paints the well

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.569 
have oil-based enamel paints the well
the<00:00:42.930> water-based<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:43.980> easier<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> work

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the water-based are a lot easier to work

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
the water-based are a lot easier to work
with<00:00:44.640> obviously<00:00:45.539> their<00:00:45.750> water<00:00:46.020> clean<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.559> if

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
with obviously their water clean up if

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
with obviously their water clean up if
you<00:00:47.129> use<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.460> oil<00:00:47.670> base<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> use

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you use an oil base you have to use

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
you use an oil base you have to use
mineral<00:00:48.780> spirits<00:00:49.379> paint<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.250> something

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mineral spirits paint there or something

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.350 
mineral spirits paint there or something
like<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.730> clean<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.399> with<00:00:53.399> modern

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
like that clean up and with modern

like that clean up and with modern
formulations<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.910> enamels<00:00:57.360> come

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
formulations a lot of your enamels come

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.920 
formulations a lot of your enamels come
they're<00:00:57.930> 100%<00:00:58.320> acrylic<00:00:59.010> based<00:00:59.539> which<00:01:00.539> crille

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they're 100% acrylic based which crille

ik is a latex or water-based type of
formulation<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.290> one<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> can

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
formulation and one thing that you can

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
formulation and one thing that you can
get<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.130> enamel<00:01:08.520> paints<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.930> they're

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
get with enamel paints is that they're

get with enamel paints is that they're
good<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> use<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:11.070> moisture<00:01:11.729> areas<00:01:12.390> prone

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
good to use in moisture areas prone

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
good to use in moisture areas prone
areas<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.530> most<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:14.130> come<00:01:15.090> with

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
areas because most of them come with

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.450 
areas because most of them come with
some<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.840> mildew<00:01:16.229> resistance<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
some kind of mildew resistance that's in

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
some kind of mildew resistance that's in
with<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> again<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.170> durable

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
with them and again they're very durable

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
good gloss finishes and enamel is also

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
good gloss finishes and enamel is also
good<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:49.340> metal<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> prime<00:01:51.090> metal

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
good to use on metal and prime metal

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.230 
good to use on metal and prime metal
areas<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:52.470> most<00:01:52.860> likely<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.460> you're<00:01:53.610> if

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
areas now most likely if you're if

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
areas now most likely if you're if
you're<00:01:54.420> painting<00:01:55.229> metal<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.399> an

you're painting metal and you use an

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.100 
you're painting metal and you use an
enamel<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.450> probably<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.960> better

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
enamel it's probably going to be better

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.709 
enamel it's probably going to be better
to<00:01:58.350> use<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> oil-based<00:01:59.040> product<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> certain

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to use the oil-based product and certain

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
to use the oil-based product and certain
things<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.829> molding<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.369> trim

and furniture and acrylic based
an<00:02:06.830> ammo<00:02:07.070> would<00:02:07.370> work<00:02:07.580> fine<00:02:07.790> so<00:02:08.180> I'm<00:02:08.300> Tim

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
an ammo would work fine so I'm Tim

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.070 
an ammo would work fine so I'm Tim
Gibson<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:09.080> what<00:02:09.260> enamel<00:02:09.650> paint<00:02:09.860> is
