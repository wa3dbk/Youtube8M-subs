00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
bothered by the diatoms like they they

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.850 
bothered by the diatoms like they they
will<00:03:25.560> grow<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.799> top<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.430> them<00:03:26.549> they'll<00:03:26.730> just

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
will grow on top of them they'll just

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.160 
will grow on top of them they'll just
they're<00:03:28.860> not<00:03:29.070> really<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.370> factor<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.630> it's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
they're not really a factor so it's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.199 
they're not really a factor so it's
obvious<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.799> diatoms<00:03:32.280> can't<00:03:32.640> take<00:03:32.910> over

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
obvious that the diatoms can't take over

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 
obvious that the diatoms can't take over
the<00:03:33.330> corals<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.230> corals<00:03:34.560> take<00:03:34.769> over

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
the corals and that the corals take over

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.170 
the corals and that the corals take over
the<00:03:35.100> diatom<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.840> pretty<00:03:37.080> cool

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the diatom so that's pretty cool

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.800 

a<00:03:39.750> small<00:03:40.379> chip<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.189> Monte<00:03:41.730> fell<00:03:42.269> off<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.780> I

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
a small chip of the Monte fell off so I

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.929 
a small chip of the Monte fell off so I
just<00:03:43.049> glued<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.469> onto<00:03:43.620> their<00:03:46.549> also<00:03:47.549> with<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
just glued it onto their also with the

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.240 
just glued it onto their also with the
the<00:03:48.420> microbubbles<00:03:49.109> I've<00:03:49.230> got<00:03:49.409> just<00:03:49.739> gotten

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the microbubbles I've got just gotten

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.059 
the microbubbles I've got just gotten
rid<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.459> those<00:03:50.989> mostly<00:03:51.989> but<00:03:52.170> what<00:03:52.439> happens<00:03:52.890> is

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
rid of those mostly but what happens is

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.830 
rid of those mostly but what happens is
the<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.700> bubbles<00:03:54.030> actually<00:03:54.269> gets<00:03:54.420> stuck<00:03:54.810> in

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
the the bubbles actually gets stuck in

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.020 
the the bubbles actually gets stuck in
the<00:03:55.019> diatoms<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.920> that's<00:03:56.459> where<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.700> get<00:03:56.939> all

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the diatoms and that's where I get all

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.179 
the diatoms and that's where I get all
these<00:03:57.180> little<00:03:57.389> bubbles<00:03:57.659> from<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.290> once<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
these little bubbles from so once the

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.099 
these little bubbles from so once the
diatoms<00:03:59.639> are<00:03:59.819> eating<00:04:00.120> with<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.450> snails<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
diatoms are eating with the snails and

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.110 
diatoms are eating with the snails and
disappear<00:04:01.859> on<00:04:01.980> their<00:04:02.099> own<00:04:02.280> these<00:04:02.879> little

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
disappear on their own these little

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.679 
disappear on their own these little
bubbles<00:04:03.299> will<00:04:03.659> most<00:04:04.409> likely<00:04:04.620> be<00:04:05.040> gone<00:04:08.689> and

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
bubbles will most likely be gone and

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:15.370 
bubbles will most likely be gone and
