guess message on it time you can fit a
giant<00:01:44.340> die<00:01:45.619> then<00:01:46.619> you'll<00:01:47.340> take<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
giant die then you'll take it and you're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.139 
giant die then you'll take it and you're
going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> fold<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.130> over<00:01:51.320> lengthwise<00:01:52.320> again

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
going to fold it over lengthwise again

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.139 
going to fold it over lengthwise again
so<00:01:54.149> you'll<00:01:54.360> fold<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.920> way<00:01:57.560> and

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
so you'll fold it over this way and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.490 
so you'll fold it over this way and
that'll<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.049> you'll<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that'll be that and then you'll do the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
that'll be that and then you'll do the
same<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> other<00:02:01.979> side

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.030 

hmm<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.649> have<00:02:09.899> both<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.959> them<00:02:11.380> folded

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
hmm so now you have both of them folded

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.630 
hmm so now you have both of them folded
over<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.700> like<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:14.010> we'll<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.489> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
over it like that then we'll take it and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.759 
over it like that then we'll take it and
you'll<00:02:15.910> make<00:02:16.750> sure<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.709> even<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:18.849> his

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
you'll make sure that it's even now his

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.820 
you'll make sure that it's even now his
you<00:02:20.769> can<00:02:21.010> actually<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:23.530> it's<00:02:23.739> not

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
you can actually do this and if it's not

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.040 
you can actually do this and if it's not
even<00:02:24.370> your<00:02:24.519> make<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.880> even<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.510> make<00:02:26.019> sure

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
even your make it even and make sure

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.220 
even your make it even and make sure
that<00:02:26.230> it's<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:27.090> truth<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.690> even<00:02:29.050> time

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
that it's the truth is on the even time

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.100 
that it's the truth is on the even time

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
pretty confident that it's enough so

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.720 
pretty confident that it's enough so
I'll<00:05:30.310> just<00:05:30.370> gonna<00:05:31.000> tape<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:32.460> takes<00:05:33.460> more

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
I'll just gonna tape that takes more

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.780 
I'll just gonna tape that takes more
tape<00:05:33.970> and<00:05:34.410> look<00:05:35.410> if<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.100> gotta<00:05:36.250> look<00:05:36.400> for<00:05:36.490> the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
tape and look if you gotta look for the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.350 
tape and look if you gotta look for the
end<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.120> just<00:05:37.210> not<00:05:37.510> be<00:05:37.660> taping<00:05:37.900> nothing<00:05:38.680> is

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
end and just not be taping nothing is

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.880 
end and just not be taping nothing is
that<00:05:40.360> be<00:05:40.630> very<00:05:40.870> unfortunate<00:05:41.320> if<00:05:41.620> we're<00:05:41.800> just

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890

that be very unfortunate if we're just
keeping<00:05:42.390> nothing<00:05:43.390> so<00:05:43.840> take<00:05:44.290> your<00:05:44.380> tape<00:05:44.560> and

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.790 
keeping nothing so take your tape and
you<00:05:45.360> pretty<00:05:46.360> round<00:05:46.630> then<00:05:47.500> you<00:05:47.590> take<00:05:47.770> your

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
you pretty round then you take your

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.210 
you pretty round then you take your
scissors<00:05:48.720> which<00:05:49.720> I<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.350> conveniently

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
scissors which I have conveniently

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.310 
scissors which I have conveniently
stored<00:05:51.460> over<00:05:51.700> here<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:52.480> cut<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.140> that

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
stored over here and you cut it so that

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.060 
stored over here and you cut it so that
it's<00:05:53.470> even<00:05:54.900> now<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:55.960> take<00:05:56.410> your<00:05:56.470> tissue<00:05:56.770> paper

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.760 
it's even now you take your tissue paper
which<00:05:57.640> I<00:05:58.180> have<00:05:58.570> stolen<00:05:58.900> from<00:05:59.200> my<00:05:59.350> bathroom

you can put it in a lot at a time but I

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.730 
you can put it in a lot at a time but I
don't<00:06:16.390> recommend<00:06:16.660> it<00:06:16.930> because<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.410> gets<00:06:17.560> all

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
don't recommend it because it gets all

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.810 
don't recommend it because it gets all
clumpy<00:06:18.190> stuff<00:06:19.229> so<00:06:20.229> you<00:06:21.130> just<00:06:21.160> put<00:06:21.430> it<00:06:21.669> in<00:06:21.760> there

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
clumpy stuff so you just put it in there

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.420 
clumpy stuff so you just put it in there
until<00:06:22.090> you

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
until you

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.180 
until you
can't<00:06:22.580> fit<00:06:22.940> any<00:06:23.210> more<00:06:23.360> than<00:06:23.720> that<00:06:23.750> this<00:06:24.680> is<00:06:25.010> to

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
can't fit any more than that this is to

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.220 
can't fit any more than that this is to
make<00:06:25.370> sure<00:06:25.400> that<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.060> hill<00:06:26.240> of<00:06:26.450> your<00:06:26.720> whatever

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
make sure that the hill of your whatever

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.530 
make sure that the hill of your whatever
is<00:06:27.620> security<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:29.060> stuff<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:30.580> then<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:32.270> take

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
is security and stuff and then you take

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.620 
is security and stuff and then you take
this<00:06:33.260> part<00:06:33.770> and<00:06:33.920> fold<00:06:34.310> it<00:06:34.460> over<00:06:34.580> like<00:06:34.880> that<00:06:35.210> you

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
this part and fold it over like that you

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.990 
this part and fold it over like that you
do<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:35.930> same<00:06:36.080> as<00:06:36.200> the<00:06:36.290> other<00:06:36.470> part<00:06:37.000> then

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
do the same as the other part then

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.230 
do the same as the other part then
you'll<00:06:38.150> have<00:06:38.300> two<00:06:38.420> triangles<00:06:38.690> picking<00:06:39.320> up

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
you'll have two triangles picking up

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.730 
you'll have two triangles picking up
you're<00:06:41.240> supposed<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.780> and<00:06:42.020> then<00:06:42.470> you<00:06:42.620> will

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
you're supposed to and then you will

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.500 
you're supposed to and then you will
take<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.070> triangles<00:06:43.550> and<00:06:43.700> put<00:06:43.850> them<00:06:43.940> down<00:06:44.120> so

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
take the triangles and put them down so

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.930 
take the triangles and put them down so
then<00:06:44.920> nobody<00:06:45.920> can<00:06:46.070> see<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.400> tissue<00:06:46.580> paper

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
then nobody can see the tissue paper

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.420 
then nobody can see the tissue paper
okay<00:06:47.300> ever<00:06:47.510> look<00:06:47.660> at<00:06:47.780> this<00:06:48.070> you<00:06:49.070> just<00:06:49.280> tape

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
okay ever look at this you just tape

okay ever look at this you just tape
that<00:06:49.610> down<00:06:49.780> and<00:06:50.780> then<00:06:50.840> you're<00:06:51.620> going<00:06:51.770> to<00:06:51.830> want

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980

that down and then you're going to want
to<00:06:52.070> tape<00:06:52.280> up<00:06:52.460> this<00:06:52.700> so<00:06:53.090> that<00:06:53.360> it<00:06:53.510> doesn't<00:06:53.690> open

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
to tape up this so that it doesn't open

that closed and working kind of fast cuz
there's<00:07:03.020> a<00:07:03.080> time<00:07:03.320> limit<00:07:03.350> on<00:07:03.680> these<00:07:03.890> videos<00:07:04.010> I

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
there's a time limit on these videos I

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.970 
there's a time limit on these videos I
know<00:07:04.730> I<00:07:04.760> can<00:07:04.970> make<00:07:05.000> a<00:07:05.150> part<00:07:05.420> two<00:07:05.450> but<00:07:05.810> I<00:07:06.080> hate<00:07:06.800> it

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
know I can make a part two but I hate it

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.630 
know I can make a part two but I hate it
when<00:07:07.010> I<00:07:07.190> have<00:07:07.430> to<00:07:07.580> look<00:07:07.820> for<00:07:08.000> part<00:07:08.240> two<00:07:08.420> so<00:07:09.640> I'm
