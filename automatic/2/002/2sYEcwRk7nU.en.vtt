00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.779
 look that 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 or with 5 of my side is in 11 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.320
 Let's make a video that shows 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 as well as play even with less 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.180
 high level character on the mat 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.180
 I'll give it to you right away. 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.590
 ae 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.250
 on one 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:15.280
 So it's ok, let's go there. 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.920
 putting a replay here will give you 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 I saw five guys on staff. 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.680
 my side is 12 and 12 at eleven on the other side 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.320
 huh 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.119
 all complete the team all training mode 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.510
 Because it 's the only way you can do it. 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.760
 This is but I assure you it was 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.979
 as you did against any team you were 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.090
 Any zaga can only do then 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.300
 come on 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:48.399
 it's good to see the final bid is to stop like 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:52.630
 It was good. 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.009
 just look at all the steps I've taken all 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.229
 the steps I've taken 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.789
 then back on video and watch one of 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.840
 new all the dynamics are but practically 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.700
 pretty much all I will not remember 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.140
 all but virtually all 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.819
 steps I took 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.700
 were passes using staff x and r2 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.040
 but that way it's very fast 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.920
 two at the same time only in cachoeirinha 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 It's good the steps to this were one of the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.480
 steps 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.330
 Sundays also personal always always 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.720
 I dominate with r 2 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.660
 I'm for a guy who's practically safe. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.090
 r2 is fine but it has a detail when 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.060
 You dominate with r 2 He'll only have to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.950
 stay if you target this analog 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.270
 to a side that is real at least 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.849
 Here, for example, is 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.810
 the game is rolling the domain that I gave 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.260
 was a domain with r 2 is only that r2 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.950
 And for babysitting, it's fine, he's already taking her away. 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 very close to the return of the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.400
 player is can see he dominates already throwing 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.580
 the other is very fast and strip there rang 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.019
 this touch also the touch using l2 x is 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.840
 a very fast topic 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.450
 there here looks directs the affection is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.550
 normal 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.640
 It's not tightening anything but this analog 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.390
 here I did this walk there 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.940
 now and if this turn 2 and the newspaper 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.090
 recalls that the angle from 90 Â° to diagonal 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.459
 up here r 2 and forth only so 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.540
 it is only in the sensibility is not done 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.510
 that's just it and holding r 2 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.250
 He gives you this cut and you're not ready. 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.549
 I need to prove anything and look there. 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.160
 this touch was with an x and 2 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.700
 there we hold r 2 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.989
 controls like an honest guinea 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.870
 that he does 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.370
 now look at this move if I drop the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.370
 personal control look here 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.480
 if I release the control and only press x 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.519
 The only guy on my 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.040
 possibility of touch this man is not 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.709
 turned over there it's just going to play obviously 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.400
 promef was what he did but like me 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:23.330
 I used r2 together here to play 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:27.039
 Excuse me, it's very fast l2. 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.039
 Look what he does 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.410
 my touch this turn 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.640
 before the ball arrives in the messi you're done 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.250
 holding r 2 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.130
 and only up when he made that sock 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.830
 curve and it is because the signal has already been sent 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.440
 people it will turn you can already let go 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.290
 everything and there when it has just turned 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:55.710
 just click too fast that the square is 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:58.710
 two at a time he does and I'm 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.800
 playing with five against 11 ok lets 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.780
 keep here a little bit not to come 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.240
 Have a long, personal dinner and you can close it. 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.810
 but I'll make new videos for you guys 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.810
 see it's good
