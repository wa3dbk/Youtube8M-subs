00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 pro comm all saints cope 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.270
 hello to all and to the INSEE 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.000
 find today for this little 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.690
 video where I will present you a spot 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.340
 of xp from level 115 120 so this 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.980
 spot of xp is valid for 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.759
 115 120 level characters with a 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 stuff 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.120
 or stuff but still in elements 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.130
 wisdom up to level 160 so we 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.750
 reopen the audio position and i'll get you 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.060
 show where I decided 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.640
 of xp so first of all why I have not 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.770
 decided to continue frigost because at 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.580
 one year old free kids I find that 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.920
 it's getting boring 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.970
 everyone is at frigost or the world 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.600
 farm lasserre du royal mouthe the world 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.689
 be royal and so I decided to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 stand out and xp solo so I 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.330
 need nobody for xp ie 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.820
 that I can xp at any time 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.920
 without having to be recruited into a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.049
 group where others so first of all I 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.049
 started doing the almanac so that's where 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.770
 the patient is a source of free xp 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.329
 if we can say it but who it is 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.460
 feasible only once a day so 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.439
 when I think you know so 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.289
 what I'm starting that I started to 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.079
 to have chained different spots 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.210
 of xp for in the end take one or two 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.960
 levels per day so what I did 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 these games start with the almanac this one 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.009
 way that this effect I was doing all the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.469
 dopers and I unlock following this 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.979
 the success that's called a big fat by 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.319
 fortnight 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.780
 so I unlock it like that myself 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.719
 did the xp dopeul plus xp of 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.639
 success Kamas more lead back 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.380
 that I had over two of the xp 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:09.420
 that I was doing on the dopeul then 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 then I went on otomai is sure 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.540
 thomas is what I did it's 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.120
 I was going into the dark jungle so the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.050
 dark jungle it's a xp spot that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 is really not bad 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.709
 simply because there are not many 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.830
 of people who are there and so we can 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.250
 find groups with stars 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.410
 alan up to 7.8 stars 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.880
 and so I think it's really not 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.489
 badly so we'll go there then the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.290
 coastal village 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:51.690
 of course you need the quest for otomai 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:56.580
 so you can go there with this 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 trick we take easily from the 200 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.709
 maybe 300 miles per fight if you 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 want an expert shortly before you 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.030
 can xp on the grassy plain 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.110
 but hey it's healthy it's worse 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.110
 it's easier but it's not so good 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.170
 so we go inside 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.610
 dark jungle by cons must do 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 watch out since the monsters agglo 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.240
 so there we can see a sheaf 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.780
 there are no canvasses so that we 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.120
 not interested we will be interested in 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.750
 starry group with a bonus of xp a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.760
 bonus from europe and so that's where we got 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.760
 a group but if it's too long this 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.300
 so we will try to look for 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.300
 small groups 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.480
 and the fights here lasts not longer than 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.800
 ten minutes one or even five minutes 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.180
 it's in five minutes it's done it's up to 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.250
 to say that if you are lucky and 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.980
 that you come across star groups 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.670
 is pretty quickly bah you take a 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.430
 good source of xp in a source of xp 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.130
 fair frigost so for example at 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.859
 frigost we take we will say 500000 xp 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.639
 by fighting on a fight that lasts that 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.850
 lasts 10 minutes 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.710
 here we take two hundred thousand with one 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.200
 group of four stars if we do the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.600
 challenge one takes two doubles and if 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.140
 we take a trainer's sweet on 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.669
 we saw we learn we do not win a lot of 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.930
 percentage of xp so that's 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.480
 fights that really do not last 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.520
 long in five minutes it's done 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.160
 as I told you and so that's it 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.960
 so that was my xp spot if 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.440
 you want to do how you can 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.880
 chain the almanac this chaining us 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.860
 the almanac this all the more drivers all 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.060
 the dark jungle and you're really going 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.110
 really xp xp quickly after will you 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.910
 have bread if you type closely 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.850
 but still, it's better than 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.919
 of xp frigost of being a mule a mule a 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.830
 sacred what and so that's it 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.220
 and you're going to have a profit too 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.140
 on the Dopels as with that with the 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.570
 success you're going to unlock lead 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.789
 and the do's are tradable for 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.640
 objects for example the parchments of 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.340
 luck the mighty parchment of luck 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.260
 or the grandparents way that I you 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.850
 mentioned in my first tip camin 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.210
 so you can have them for free 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.100
 thanks to the dolphus so it is found that 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.169

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.680
