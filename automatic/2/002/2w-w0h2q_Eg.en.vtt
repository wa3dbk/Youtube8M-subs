00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
but other than that they are the same

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.930 
but other than that they are the same
tools<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:50.890> if<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.100> want<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.399> flush<00:00:51.609> cutter<00:00:51.850> i

tools so if you want the flush cutter i

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.579 
tools so if you want the flush cutter i
would<00:00:52.179> definitely<00:00:52.359> go<00:00:52.600> with<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:52.899> four<00:00:53.319> piece

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589

mini<00:00:54.010> over<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.699> three-piece<00:00:55.179> but<00:00:55.780> that's<00:00:55.929> the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
mini over the three-piece but that's the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.869 
mini over the three-piece but that's the
only<00:00:56.260> difference<00:00:56.620> between<00:00:57.190> these<00:00:57.309> two<00:00:57.640> and

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.230 
nylon tip pliers now what's interesting
about<00:02:02.469> this<00:02:02.770> one<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.189> it<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.520> actually<00:02:04.210> a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
about this one is it is actually a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.209 
about this one is it is actually a
little<00:02:04.539> bit<00:02:04.659> bigger<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.799> can<00:02:05.920> see<00:02:06.100> the

little bit bigger you can see the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.219 
little bit bigger you can see the
handles<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.670> little<00:02:06.789> bit<00:02:06.999> longer<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.929> it

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
handles a little bit longer so it

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.719 
handles a little bit longer so it
actually<00:02:08.470> fits<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:08.950> your<00:02:09.039> hand<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.340> little<00:02:09.550> bit

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.700 
little bit easier on your hands another
good<00:03:53.060> reason<00:03:53.450> why<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.720> particularly<00:03:54.140> like<00:03:54.590> this

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
good reason why I particularly like this

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.890 
good reason why I particularly like this
one<00:03:55.510> you'll<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.930> bead<00:03:57.170> scoop<00:03:58.750> which<00:03:59.750> is

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
one you'll get a bead scoop which is

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.100 
one you'll get a bead scoop which is
actually<00:04:00.260> really<00:04:00.410> helpful<00:04:01.900> you'll<00:04:02.900> get<00:04:03.080> a

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
actually really helpful you'll get a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.480 
actually really helpful you'll get a
pair<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.590> tweezers<00:04:05.770> now<00:04:06.770> with<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.040> one<00:04:07.280> you

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
pair of tweezers now with this one you

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.510 
pair of tweezers now with this one you
won't<00:04:07.640> get<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.090> pair<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:09.310> split<00:04:10.310> ring<00:04:10.490> pliers

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
won't get the pair of split ring pliers

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.100 
won't get the pair of split ring pliers
so<00:04:11.180> if<00:04:11.270> that's<00:04:11.360> something<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> are

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
so if that's something that you are

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.540 
so if that's something that you are
looking<00:04:12.470> for<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.680> definitely<00:04:13.130> recommend<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
looking for I definitely recommend the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.000 
looking for I definitely recommend the
other<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.930> something<00:04:15.380> that's<00:04:15.470> really

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
other one but something that's really

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.280 
other one but something that's really
nice<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.520> instead<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.420> carrying<00:04:17.930> an<00:04:18.049> extra

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
nice is instead of carrying an extra

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.470 
nice is instead of carrying an extra
pair<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> scissors<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.040> can<00:04:19.489> carry<00:04:19.760> thread

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
pair of scissors you can carry thread

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.050 
pair of scissors you can carry thread
snips<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:22.100> comes<00:04:22.340> nice<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.850> good

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
snips and that comes nice with a good

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.050 
snips and that comes nice with a good
safety<00:04:23.480> cap<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:25.010> keep<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.400> mind<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.820> if<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
safety cap just keep in mind that if you

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.969 
safety cap just keep in mind that if you
are<00:04:26.210> traveling<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.169> will<00:04:27.350> not<00:04:27.500> be<00:04:27.680> able<00:04:27.860> to

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979
