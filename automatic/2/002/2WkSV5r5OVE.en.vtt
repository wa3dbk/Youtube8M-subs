00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.500
 [Music] 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.140
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.590
 today a second part of me arrives 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.510
 collection of life from mix in this 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.920
 video I'm going to talk about lipsticks 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.050
 roses with their purple tone in life 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.690
 and good it will be a video shorter than the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.540
 previous because they are the tones with the 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.840
 that less favored video and I only have 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.200
 5 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 and good is the competition 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.130
 595 our movements 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.420
 [Music] 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.750
 what is simple very clearly 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.700
 [Music] 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.650
 it's ni mate 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.140
 it's a tone that you have to have 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.210
 careful because 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.180
 If you do not have very hydrated lips 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 immediately you notice the pebbles and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 it's also a tone that I think only 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.269
 It is suitable for clear skin and yet 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.360
 better with a gloss on top or something because 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.409
 I saw how white I am. 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.289
 tornado de alestra a labial 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.319
 very beautiful but that is even more 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.110
 complicated to carry that one of these 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.480
 What do they do 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.780
 dead lips 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.430
 off much the tone of the lips while 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 It is a very beautiful tone 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.040
 it's difficult is everything 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 I need 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 [Music] 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.759
 and well I said very nice but 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.070
 difficult 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.070
 this is the 579 is fine 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.110
 which is also a light pink but in 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.259
 this case is not matte in the hair touch of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.259
 brightness 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.610
 and despite being a 2 so also planted 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.039
 a lot, not much more 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.039
 wearable and the fact see 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.229
 [Music] 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.569
 one month of psuv different shades in one 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.750
 quite more tone 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.750
 warm and it's in the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.750
 how 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.520
 this is much more possible 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.000
 this 6 628 rose 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.270
 What it is a matte rose a little more uploaded 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.470
 than the previous ones 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.810
 but it is very tale is a tone that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.120
 It seems perfect to wear daily 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.710
 although it is true that it is a tone 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.710
 more uploaded but it's not overdone 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.470
 [Music] 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.349
 when I bought it I thought I would take a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.110
 tone more clearly because I had seen 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:25.629
 photos over the internet and it looked like a rose 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.450
 softer but not and still the truth is 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.209
 I like it a lot 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 and even if it's a little bit more exaggerated than 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.209
 what I expected can be carried without 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.209
 problem 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 529 thalía is one of the best known 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.980
 It is also a rose but with its tone 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.980
 purple 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.390
 she is mother too 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.599
 [Music] 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.040
 although you see a style the truth 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.430
 it's like a lip tone but 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.500
 but prettier it is as if he does not wear 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.600
 nothing will simply highlight your environment 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.269
 natural of the lips or what you 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.960
 you add the sector not as purple is 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:27.930
 a very beautiful color very natural very for 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.720
 daily and although this kind of environments 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.360
 are the ones that I like least or with the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.620
 that we fill favored to me of all 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.120
 the purple tones and such this is very 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.009
 clarito and the truth is that I like 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.139
 you 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:51.580
 and to finish this 621 day 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:55.210
 which is the same as italy but it is a tone 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.210
 more severe 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.530
 done if we compare the bars 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:09.220
 I'm here is thalía and stella trembles 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.220
 you see 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.520
 practically the same only as the milan 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.080
 two 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.330
 it's more is pure 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.750
 [Music] 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.530
 maybe you see 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.700
 a little less brown tone 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.400
 was in spite of being a pink that throws 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.650
 purple also has a little touch of 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.560
 brown that makes it more natural and 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.630
 milan not but on the lips is that is 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.260
 practically the same tone but a little 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.750
 more this lipstick is one of the least used 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.770
 because it 's slower plus negative what 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.889
 I prefer for winter 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.139
 and I still have trouble wearing it, I do not see myself 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.840
 with the 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.650
 but hey it's also a very nice tone 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.379
 and it's a lot and good this has been all 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.560
 as for pink lipsticks your consul 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:08.810

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.120
