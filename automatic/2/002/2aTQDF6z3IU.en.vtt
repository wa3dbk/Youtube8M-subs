00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 I have the pleasure to introduce yarol 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 guitarist of the group fff who skim the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.870
 French scenes right now then 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.670
 yarol how did you come to the guitar and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 Ben listen to these young people I have a friend 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 from my mother who brought me from cech 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.730
 mamar bearish 8 9 years ago I flashed there 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 top and century with his guitar that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 we are generated taste of turning around 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 and therefore there is always 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 okay and after after berry study 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.540
 that they were influences italy 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.920
 quite logical course 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.149
 chuck berry i started by listening to i 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 say a lot of rhythm and blues stuff 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.020
 of rock an old rock of lanus things 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.219
 like that then after I clear them 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.360
 stones the beatles hendrix led zep 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.039
 aerosmith be black line groups of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.649
 rock jazz band funk anelik not the 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 to develop an evolution is okay and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 it's the mix of rock and the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.199
 funk that makes your style so lighten up 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 just as I said I always 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.019
 preferred the rock side in the side funk 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.979
 rock funk of a gang and you could 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.869
 show us some aspects 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 characteristics of your particular game 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 rhythmic or mix of him a melody 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
 cadets that were bahia a lot 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:20.150
 actually of people people of all 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.150
 the mines very simple kind excuse me 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.470
 it's good also all the plans a little 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.470
 more in ideals 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 and 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.640
 2 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.950
 3 and rich that thing and then also I 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.179
 do not know goat is hard to do 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 badly tried to control the feedback 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.439
 would put time and levels and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 who can recover with a guitar 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.319
 other than others that I wanted with 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 pedals 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.259
 yeah okay touched the guitar 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.909
 besides, by the way, we speak on the pedal 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.679
 do you mean I even have a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.170
 just now you 're using the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.390
 pedal is what you can show have 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.150
 everyone 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.090
 the sound that it gives that I can 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.020
 do something next to abobo 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.069
 here you are just that all that 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.410
 is the plans actually like you 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.410
 are then for the rhythmic funk ccc 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.620
 this stuff 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.620
 gibbons after tenfold 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:58.120
 we want expressive commitments 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.520
 what impressive swordsmen of 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.440
 functioning and in the group 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.810
 mud the group in which you play with 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.940
 your brother you're not on the guitar of the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.940
 battery is it the guitar 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.950
 rhythmic that pushed you to play the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.990
 battery or is this club and it can be 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 what the battery and brings something 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.050
 thing at the guitaristic level actually this 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.070
 what he wants when I was little brother 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.360
 him when I was in the room is empty 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.350
 handed the advise the battery so we 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.520
 is also in the room and the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.810
 guitar a battery that makes graph 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.810
 now he is the one who lives in Ariza 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.430
 mad men with both of us 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.650
 was trading vachon instruments and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.720
 all this and it is clear that I advise 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.750
 to all musicians who is guitarist 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.980
 singer bassist or other a day or 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.620
 the other was interested in the battery and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.090
 to try to play the drums without 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.860
 necessarily sowing them to become great 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.060
 drummers but just for the side 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.740
 rhythmic and this attachment to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.590
 understand how they are fucking the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.090
 the stuff and that's the structures of the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.740
 pieces then comes the placement in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 rhythmic inside the stuff I was 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.370
 obliged when and drummer to be there and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.240
 she's up no idea about this 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.000
 I know a lot of guitarists 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.280
 who play very complicated stuff but 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.570
 who on the other hand what about the game a 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.220
 simple trick put really be the 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.800
 Breakfast really is the make 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.980
 government says it's not always the 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.180
 case 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.590
 a year that it was playing the drums for 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.290
 that's really interesting is 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.450
 really useful 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.290
 the agreement thanks to vol ba nothing is going 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.350
 play now on board either 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.350

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.169
 Yes 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.389
