00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
The Stand just lets the plane sit on it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.559 
The Stand just lets the plane sit on it
there<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:20.869> go<00:01:22.030> okay<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.420> pretty

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
there we go okay this is pretty

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.899 
there we go okay this is pretty
interesting<00:01:23.959> here<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.770> transmitter<00:01:25.729> we

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
interesting here is the transmitter we

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.949 
interesting here is the transmitter we
have<00:01:26.090> throttle<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.030> left<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.509> there's<00:01:29.780> no

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
have throttle on the left and there's no

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.870 
have throttle on the left and there's no
Springs<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.799> will<00:01:31.009> stay<00:01:31.310> where<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.640> want

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
Springs so it will stay where you want

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.749 
Springs so it will stay where you want
and<00:01:32.060> we<00:01:32.539> have<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.719> really<00:01:33.109> the<00:01:33.859> coil<00:01:34.369> on<00:01:34.579> the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
and we have a really the coil on the

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.339 
and we have a really the coil on the
back<00:01:34.969> is<00:01:35.240> proportionate<00:01:36.490> with<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.670> stick

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
back is proportionate with the stick

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:41.050 
back is proportionate with the stick
instead<00:01:39.349> of<00:01:39.590> slamming<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.399> slamming<00:01:40.849> off

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
instead of slamming on and slamming off

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.839 
instead of slamming on and slamming off
this<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.450> pretty<00:01:41.689> neat<00:01:42.219> all<00:01:43.219> right<00:01:43.459> let's<00:01:43.700> give

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
this is pretty neat all right let's give

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.260 
this is pretty neat all right let's give
it<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:44.030> try<00:01:44.270> okay

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.440 

Jeff's<00:01:47.569> going<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.840> be<00:01:47.989> my<00:01:48.140> cameraman<00:01:48.950> and

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
Jeff's going to be my cameraman and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.940 
Jeff's going to be my cameraman and
we're<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.599> go<00:01:50.750> ahead<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.110> fly<00:01:51.349> in<00:01:51.649> the

we're going to go ahead and fly in the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.729 
we're going to go ahead and fly in the
my<00:01:52.700> garage<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.209> here<00:01:53.420> which<00:01:53.599> is<00:01:53.629> not<00:01:54.469> all<00:01:54.619> that

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
my garage in here which is not all that

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.679 
my garage in here which is not all that
big<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:55.819> you<00:01:56.000> see<00:01:56.179> it<00:01:56.299> got<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.479> lot<00:01:56.659> of

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
big and as you see it got a lot of

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.279 
big and as you see it got a lot of
obstacles<00:01:56.959> around<00:01:57.739> run<00:01:58.399> into<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.479> we'll<00:02:00.020> find

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
obstacles around run into so we'll find

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.380 
obstacles around run into so we'll find
out<00:02:00.469> if<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.739> really<00:02:00.950> can<00:02:01.219> fly<00:02:01.609> inside<00:02:02.060> right

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
out if it really can fly inside right

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.099 
out if it really can fly inside right
Jeff<00:02:03.039> okay<00:02:04.039> here<00:02:04.399> we<00:02:04.489> go

okay when you turn it to the right the

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.180 
okay when you turn it to the right the
power<00:02:08.780> comes<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.319> you've<00:02:09.530> got<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.739> red<00:02:10.039> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
power comes on you've got a red and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.530 
power comes on you've got a red and
green<00:02:10.220> light<00:02:10.579> there<00:02:10.849> when<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.209> turn<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
green light there when you turn it to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.229 
green light there when you turn it to
the<00:02:11.720> left<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:12.019> get<00:02:12.200> charging<00:02:12.709> here<00:02:13.040> red<00:02:13.910> means

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
the left to get charging here red means

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.569 
the left to get charging here red means
it's<00:02:14.389> charging<00:02:14.870> it'll<00:02:15.440> change<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.099> green<00:02:16.310> when

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579

had a problem with in fact Shaun Donovan
came<00:02:26.060> up<00:02:26.239> with<00:02:26.389> this<00:02:26.540> little<00:02:27.459> air<00:02:28.459> scoop<00:02:28.880> put

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
came up with this little air scoop put

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.800 
came up with this little air scoop put
on<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.579> side<00:02:31.849> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.090> body<00:02:32.299> because<00:02:32.599> as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
on to the side of the body because as

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.470 
on to the side of the body because as
you<00:02:33.109> see<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.560> rounded<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.940> on/off

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
you see this is rounded and the on/off

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.539 
you see this is rounded and the on/off
switch<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.870> right<00:02:36.410> here<00:02:36.709> sticking<00:02:37.069> out<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
switch is right here sticking out on the

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.870 
switch is right here sticking out on the
bottom<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.569> if<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> hard<00:02:39.260> landing<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
bottom so if you have a hard landing the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.809 
bottom so if you have a hard landing the
switch<00:02:41.180> breaks<00:02:41.540> off<00:02:41.859> so<00:02:42.859> this<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.400> guard

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
switch breaks off so this is a guard

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.300 
switch breaks off so this is a guard
that<00:02:44.150> John<00:02:44.389> came<00:02:44.660> up<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.109> and<00:02:45.410> really<00:02:45.980> makes

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
that John came up with and really makes

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.979 
that John came up with and really makes
sense<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.819> they<00:02:46.880> should<00:02:47.120> actually<00:02:47.329> do<00:02:47.780> that

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
sense and they should actually do that

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.170 
sense and they should actually do that
at<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.230> factory<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.609> protect<00:02:50.030> that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
at the factory so you can protect that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.020 
at the factory so you can protect that
switch
