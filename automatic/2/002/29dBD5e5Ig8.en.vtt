00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.139
 they may be interested and it is nothing more and nothing 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.750
 unless this product of my life is 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 Say a style of living Gringo 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.449

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.099
 product is is the moisturizer 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.279

 promises this product that is the most 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 important to verify if really 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.120

 hours also says that it will protect you 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.300
 of the sun is to say that it has a filter 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.839
 solar from another 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.320
 He also says that he is going to offer you a 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.930
 fresh formula for your skin and pretty 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.619
 light also says that his formula 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.340
 contains vitality is that it provides a 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.549
 radiant look on your face and that you 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 balances the tone of tupi I have 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 the version that is for all skin types 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.340
 it worked for me it worked for me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.549
 perfectly and really that has 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.720
 become one of my in some of my 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:35.140
 favorite products for the diary for 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.020
 my life has said to choose the natural tone 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.229
 and although it appears to me or it seems to me 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 principle that I had very but very little 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.720
 product that contains little product for 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.569
 nothing has been because of truth 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.409
 It took me about five months sliding the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.840
 has surrendered still has product 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.810
 and really 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 it has worked to perfection 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.020
 perfectly matches the tonality of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.240
 your face since it does not have great 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.570
 pigmentation but nevertheless if you 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 Take off a little you're reddish that you can 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.800
 have is quite unified for example in 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.970
 the area here that is usually a bit more 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.920
 dark also the area here that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.530
 It is also usually different in color 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.830
 something tenuous but if it is usually 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.060
 different color and some spots 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.710
 Of course I do not hide the dark circles but if I 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.400
 me the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:44.050
 the original tone of same dark circles me the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.630
 attenuates a definitely dry game 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.900
 fast and within all the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.320
 standards that we can talk about and also 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 What I love is that the skin 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.880
 absorbs so it's not necessary to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.660
 nothing is put yourself dust fact that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.390
 I am pro dust sometimes I forget 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.580
 because he applied me the same eyes 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.800
 it's something in itself and after that I gave myself 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.830
 mind that I did not throw myself dust and nothing 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.190
 it drips on me for nothing I start to sweat 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.740
 and I'm not the opposite, it's hard for me 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.470
 very very well if I feel that the filter 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.930
 solar works on this product I 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.870
 protects the skin even though it has a 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.230
 Very little amount of protection 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.530
 solar 600 that protects my skin I have not 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.640
 I've been with them 24 hours but if I've 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.070
 been about 12 hours or 14 hours and it has 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.190
 kept the product installed in my 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.940
 face despite having 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.640
 plenty of sunshine these days and although 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.670
 I was a little over the course of days and 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.840
 it lasts very well on my face 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.350
 use it and the most practical and easy and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.080
 with very clean hands 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.720
 give circular movements as if 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.840
 you were placing a cream and so 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.690
 distribute it all over the face has 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.300
 to be quick because if it does not dry and if not 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.880
 distribute it with your hands with the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.570
 brushes usually leave marks because 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.040
 It dries very quickly, it makes me shine 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 personal ok neither in zone t nor in the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.360
 cheekbones I feel that even though it is a 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.660
 cake makeup product that is if 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.760
 I feel that it moisturizes my skin that is 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.000
 doing something positive and not 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.970
 counterproductive to my skin has the smell 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.680
 typical of Libyan products but to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.660
 I do not mind the truth and if you 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.950
 feel a little until when is 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.410
 placed but that would already be an opinion 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.660
 very very personal to me does not bother me 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.480
 palate does not rust 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.690
 on the skin is like that as 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.680
 you place as you are going to last all the 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.380
 day 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.390
 the only one I could give them is 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.880
 that you have to handle it very fast 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.920
 because if you do not realize well what 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.270
 what are you doing and if you do not 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.030
 fast you do not usually leave marks that if 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.800
 here it dried very fast and it did not give you chance 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.860
 and here not then if you usually see but 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.040
 it's more than all knowing how to handle it would give 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.770
 that against because it makes you heal 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.780
 too much like they can not take you 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.170
 time with the brush if with 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.150
 this is pont would be the only one against 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.120
 you could give this product because it 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.450
 staff has found me what would 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.760
 buy a thousand times because it is what I use 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.120
 daily to make up 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.210
 I found in a farmatode and for now I do not know 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.420
 find or at least I have not 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.790
 seen and I think I bought it like in 120 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.030
 bolivars, in my opinion, the price is 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.280
 well for what the product does and how 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.990
 it works on my skin 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.669
 that 's all for today I hope 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.650
 that they have liked and that they have 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.850
 served a little this review of this 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.060
 product 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.610
