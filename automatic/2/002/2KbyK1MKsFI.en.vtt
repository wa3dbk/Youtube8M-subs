Walvoord said at Dallas yeah that's
right<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.810> should<00:01:15.990> continually<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.680> reading

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
right we should continually be reading
the<00:01:17.130> Bible<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.580> should<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.939> hearing<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> but

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the Bible we should be hearing it but

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.940 
the Bible we should be hearing it but
then<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.049> final<00:01:19.380> point<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.799> be

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
then also that final point is to be

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
then also that final point is to be
heating<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.240> doing<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> says

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
heating it would be doing what it says

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.649 
heating it would be doing what it says
so<00:01:22.710> its<00:01:22.890> present<00:01:23.400> tense<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.939> keep<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> reading

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
so its present tense we keep on reading

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200 
so its present tense we keep on reading
we<00:01:24.930> keep<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> hearing<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.860> thirdly<00:01:26.220> we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we keep on hearing and then thirdly we

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.690 
we keep on hearing and then thirdly we
should<00:01:27.450> study<00:01:27.780> prophecy<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:28.799> prophetic

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
should study prophecy because prophetic

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
should study prophecy because prophetic

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
come up hither is that the rapture of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.670 
come up hither is that the rapture of
the<00:03:14.940> church<00:03:15.180> well<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> don't<00:03:16.170> think<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the church well I don't think it's the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.050 
the church well I don't think it's the
rapture<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.220> church<00:03:17.490> there<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.880> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
rapture of the church there in that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
rapture of the church there in that
passage<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.750> think<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.170> picture<00:03:19.530> of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
passage but I think it's a picture of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.020 
passage but I think it's a picture of
what<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.920> raptures<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.610> mean<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.910> only

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
what the raptures like I mean the only

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.700 
what the raptures like I mean the only
one<00:03:21.210> that's<00:03:21.420> caught<00:03:21.630> up<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:21.990> in<00:03:22.140> revelation

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
one that's caught up there in revelation

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.040 
one that's caught up there in revelation
1<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.070> John<00:03:23.340> himself<00:03:23.550> right<00:03:24.270> but<00:03:24.480> he<00:03:24.570> John<00:03:24.870> is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
1 is John himself right but he John is

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.930 
1 is John himself right but he John is
taken<00:03:25.440> up<00:03:25.560> there<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:25.920> says<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.310> spirit

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
taken up there and it says in the spirit

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
taken up there and it says in the spirit
and<00:03:27.180> he<00:03:27.750> sees<00:03:28.020> these<00:03:28.320> things<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.800> are<00:03:28.890> in<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and he sees these things that are in the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.890 
and he sees these things that are in the
future<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.550> like<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.000> say<00:03:30.180> John<00:03:30.450> was<00:03:30.660> kind<00:03:30.870> of

Chronos<00:03:59.910> has<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.270> do<00:04:00.330> with<00:04:00.450> chronological

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
Chronos has to do with chronological

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.530 
Chronos has to do with chronological
time<00:04:01.650> as<00:04:01.920> we<00:04:02.070> know<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.430> Kairos<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.210> idea

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
time as we know and Kairos is the idea

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.600 
time as we know and Kairos is the idea
of<00:04:03.570> an<00:04:03.780> appointed<00:04:04.350> season<00:04:04.890> or<00:04:05.100> an<00:04:05.160> appointed

time<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.540> time<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.960> near<00:04:07.200> there<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> think

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
time and the time is near there I think

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.410 
time and the time is near there I think
just<00:04:07.800> speaks<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.130> imminency<00:04:08.730> speaks<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.300> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
just speaks of imminency speaks of the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.910 
just speaks of imminency speaks of the
fact<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.260> know<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.530> Lord<00:04:10.710> could<00:04:10.860> come

at<00:04:11.220> any<00:04:11.280> time<00:04:11.430> people<00:04:11.850> say<00:04:12.150> well<00:04:12.360> how<00:04:12.540> was<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
at any time people say well how was the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.290 
at any time people say well how was the
time<00:04:13.200> near<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.280> been<00:04:14.430> 1,900<00:04:15.150> years

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300

near<00:04:19.290> in<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.470> sense<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:20.010> imminent

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
near in the sense that it's imminent

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.950 
near in the sense that it's imminent
that<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.730> can<00:04:20.880> happen<00:04:21.030> at<00:04:21.270> any<00:04:21.420> moment<00:04:21.510> and

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
that it can happen at any moment and

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.310 
that it can happen at any moment and
when<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.440> era<00:04:22.710> begins<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.880> God<00:04:24.320> initiating

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
when the era begins of God initiating

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.260 
when the era begins of God initiating
his<00:04:25.530> prophetic<00:04:26.100> timetable

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
his prophetic timetable
