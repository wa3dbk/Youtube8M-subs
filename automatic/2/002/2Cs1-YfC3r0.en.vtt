tony del rio know what makes this

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.799 
tony del rio know what makes this
program<00:00:06.930> unique<00:00:07.610> from<00:00:08.610> my<00:00:08.790> experiences<00:00:09.570> there

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
program unique from my experiences there

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.709 
program unique from my experiences there
isn't<00:00:10.070> there<00:00:11.070> isn't<00:00:11.340> much<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.269> usually

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
isn't there isn't much like it usually

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.310 
isn't there isn't much like it usually
you<00:00:12.840> bring<00:00:13.080> people<00:00:13.710> together<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.320> acting

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
you bring people together just to acting

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
you bring people together just to acting
or<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.890> filmmaking<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.180> kind<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
or just do filmmaking and you kind of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960 
or just do filmmaking and you kind of
separate<00:00:18.960> them<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.980> do<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.670> kind<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
separate them and if you do you kind of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000 
separate them and if you do you kind of
do<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.600> very<00:00:21.869> limited<00:00:22.109> resources<00:00:22.769> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
do it with very limited resources I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.230 
do it with very limited resources I
think<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.310> makes<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.609> unique<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
think what makes this unique is that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
think what makes this unique is that
it's<00:00:24.510> actually<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.900> program<00:00:25.410> with

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it's actually a program with

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
it's actually a program with
cutting-edge<00:00:26.970> stuff<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
cutting-edge stuff and I think that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.179 
cutting-edge stuff and I think that
usually<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> separate<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:31.890> artistic

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
usually that is separate your artistic

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
usually that is separate your artistic
is<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.640> artistic<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.210> creative<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.899> your

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
is your artistic your creative is your

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.870 
is your artistic your creative is your
creative<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:35.130> technicals<00:00:35.730> your

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
creative and your your technicals your

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
creative and your your technicals your
technical<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> accumulation<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
technical and this is a accumulation of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.160 
technical and this is a accumulation of
everything<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
everything and I think that is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
everything and I think that is
definitely<00:00:40.170> unique<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.620> most<00:00:40.860> programs<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
definitely unique to most programs that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.560 
definitely unique to most programs that
I've<00:00:41.460> ever<00:00:41.640> heard<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:43.399> first<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.090> class

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I've ever heard it first off the class

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.190 
I've ever heard it first off the class
that<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.820> very<00:00:47.820> their<00:00:48.660> diverse<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that I have now is very their diverse in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
that I have now is very their diverse in
every<00:00:49.530> sense<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.690> actors<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
every sense and that we have actors that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
every sense and that we have actors that
come<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:52.590> acting<00:00:52.920> background<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
come up with an acting background and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
come up with an acting background and
then<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.059> people<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.719> never<00:00:54.899> done

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
then we have people have never done

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
then we have people have never done
anything<00:00:55.320> before<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.820> people

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
anything before and then we have people

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410 
anything before and then we have people
that<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.780> done<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:59.010> films<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.210> past

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that have done other films in the past

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.779 
that have done other films in the past
so<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.559> terms<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.039> seeing<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
so in terms of seeing it all kind of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
so in terms of seeing it all kind of
breakout<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.420> always<00:01:03.690> interesting<00:01:03.989> when

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
breakout it's always interesting when

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580 
breakout it's always interesting when
you<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.070> someone<00:01:05.700> who<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.200> confident<00:01:07.200> in

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
you have someone who is confident in

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.230 
you have someone who is confident in
what<00:01:07.650> they're<00:01:08.010> doing<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.670> someone<00:01:09.060> who<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
what they're doing with someone who is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
what they're doing with someone who is
not<00:01:09.390> confident<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> doers<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.799> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
not confident the doers then we kind of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
not confident the doers then we kind of
pair<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.540> confident<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
think anyone here is shy to ask someone

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
think anyone here is shy to ask someone
who<00:01:33.479> knows<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.960> they're<00:01:34.380> doing<00:01:34.619> has<00:01:34.860> been

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
who knows what they're doing has been

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
who knows what they're doing has been
more<00:01:35.220> confident<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.909> vice<00:01:36.240> versa<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:39.509> future

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
more confident and vice versa the future

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469 
more confident and vice versa the future
goal<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.470> obviously<00:01:41.340> everyone<00:01:42.240> who's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
goal is obviously everyone who's

involved to get like a demo reel and I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.940 
involved to get like a demo reel and I
think<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.899> should<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.110> everyone's<00:01:46.530> goal<00:01:46.770> to
