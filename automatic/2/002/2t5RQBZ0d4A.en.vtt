on the end and that's your intermittent

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.420 
on the end and that's your intermittent
setting<00:01:18.200> if<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.470> starts<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> rain<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.250> little

this is variable speed slow the faster

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.149 
this is variable speed slow the faster
you<00:01:28.530> drive<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.460> faster<00:01:30.030> they'll<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.950> when

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you slow down they slow down so that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.580 
you slow down they slow down so that
they're<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:35.090> at<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.420> stop<00:01:36.689> sign<00:01:36.960> and

they're not going at the stop sign and

now you're on variable speed fast once

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
now you're on variable speed fast once
