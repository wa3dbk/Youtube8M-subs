00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.860 
plug it into a wall something if you
want<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.510> do<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:10.060> then<00:03:11.060> another<00:03:11.390> one

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
want to do that and then another one

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.720 
want to do that and then another one
here<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.970> seems<00:03:17.900> like<00:03:18.019> we<00:03:18.350> also<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:19.160> get<00:03:19.430> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
here and seems like we also do get a

here and seems like we also do get a
third<00:03:20.420> one<00:03:20.450> here<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.329> could<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.510> good

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
third one here so that could be good

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.850 
third one here so that could be good
depending<00:03:24.079> on<00:03:24.470> where<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.459> live<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.620> then

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
depending on where you do live and then

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.210
