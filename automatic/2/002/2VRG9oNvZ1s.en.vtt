00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
comes open cross and the risk cross keep

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.360 
comes open cross and the risk cross keep
little<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> pink<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.510> wraps

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
little this side the pink and then wraps

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.140 
little this side the pink and then wraps
and<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.780> white<00:01:04.880> flexes<00:01:06.920> okay<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and the white flexes okay see it here

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.679 
and the white flexes okay see it here
comes<00:01:09.710> open<00:01:10.939> cross<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.450> wrap<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.640> flex<00:01:14.689> once

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
comes open cross and wrap and flex once

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
comes open cross and wrap and flex once
you<00:01:15.869> flex<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.710> white<00:01:17.189> hand<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.420> pulls<00:01:19.140> across

cross and wrap flex and pull now that
hand<00:02:03.420> positioning<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.289> really<00:02:05.130> important<00:02:05.819> so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
hand positioning is really important so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.029 
hand positioning is really important so
spend<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.709> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> time<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.549> going<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
spend a lot of time just going over that

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.479 
spend a lot of time just going over that
like<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.310> am<00:02:11.519> with<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> point<00:02:12.239> wrapped<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
like I am with the point wrapped up and

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.460 
like I am with the point wrapped up and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
tales once you've practiced that lots

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.400 
tales once you've practiced that lots
plenty<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.819> time<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.019> think<00:02:25.230> about

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
plenty of time you can think about

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.729 
plenty of time you can think about
introducing<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.370> boy<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:28.049> going<00:02:28.500> by

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
doing a 3 B tween and also when we learn

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.789 
doing a 3 B tween and also when we learn
new<00:02:33.780> moves<00:02:34.340> try<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> concentrate<00:02:36.359> on<00:02:37.260> keeping

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
new moves try to concentrate on keeping

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.820 
new moves try to concentrate on keeping
the<00:02:38.190> point<00:02:39.260> smoothly

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
the point smoothly

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.650 
the point smoothly
and<00:02:40.950> slowly<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:43.260> always<00:02:43.500> very<00:02:43.560> tempting<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
and slowly it's always very tempting to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.210 
and slowly it's always very tempting to
speed<00:02:45.660> things<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.530> all<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.980> does<00:02:47.190> is

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
speed things up and all that does is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.210 
speed things up and all that does is
make<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.820> trick<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.330> lot<00:02:49.080> harder<00:02:49.380> because<00:02:49.890> your

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
make the trick a lot harder because your

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.870 
make the trick a lot harder because your
timing<00:02:50.850> has<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.630> much<00:02:51.810> more<00:02:51.870> precise

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
timing has to be that much more precise

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.910 
timing has to be that much more precise
okay<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.630> i<00:02:54.660> start<00:02:54.990> with<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.200> three<00:02:55.500> beat<00:02:55.740> we

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
okay so i start with the three beat we

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.520 
okay so i start with the three beat we
here<00:02:56.460> comes<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.030> five<00:02:57.470> nap<00:02:59.210> rap<00:03:00.210> rap<00:03:03.530> crossref

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.300 

and<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.269> flexing<00:03:23.989> hand<00:03:24.290> will<00:03:24.950> make<00:03:25.159> the

and that flexing hand will make the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.140 
and that flexing hand will make the
point<00:03:25.900> overtake<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.219> lead<00:03:28.219> on<00:03:28.939> the<00:03:29.120> other
