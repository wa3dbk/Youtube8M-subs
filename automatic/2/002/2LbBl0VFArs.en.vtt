00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
here they threw their rocks this way
destroying<00:01:27.869> most<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> area<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
destroying most of this area in the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.630 
destroying most of this area in the
front<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.689> led<00:01:30.810> me<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> lose<00:01:31.640> however

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
front that's what led me to lose however

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
front that's what led me to lose however
far<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> side<00:01:33.570> thicker<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.930> probably

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
far to make the side thicker I probably

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.210 
far to make the side thicker I probably
would<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.680> won<00:01:36.560> then<00:01:37.560> we'll<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
would have won then we'll go to this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
would have won then we'll go to this
area<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> did<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.680> find<00:01:41.070> out

bit off-centered so I had to put it on
one<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.880> blocks<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:03.640> needs<00:02:04.640> were<00:02:04.790> doors

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
Nexus level stuff this is level 3 that's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.070 
Nexus level stuff this is level 3 that's
because<00:02:23.120> i<00:02:23.209> restarted<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.200> because<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:26.080> don't

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
because i restarted just because I don't

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320 
because i restarted just because I don't
know<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.500> felt<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.760> left<00:02:28.970> is

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
know I just felt like it I just left is

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.310 
know I just felt like it I just left is
that<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.630> go<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> bathroom<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:31.959> ya<00:02:32.959> end<00:02:33.140> up

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that to go to the bathroom and ya end up

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.830 
that to go to the bathroom and ya end up
dying<00:02:35.380> let<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.530> last<00:02:36.800> me<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> lot<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.840> yeah

dying let this last me a lot so yeah
what<00:02:39.050> happened<00:02:39.170> was<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.560> pig<00:02:39.800> zombies<00:02:40.100> would

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
what happened was the pig zombies would

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.400 
what happened was the pig zombies would
uh<00:02:40.610> since<00:02:41.360> there<00:02:42.670> where's<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> Thera<00:02:44.410> they

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
uh since there where's the Thera they

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.620 
uh since there where's the Thera they
can't<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.800> damaged<00:02:46.160> by<00:02:46.340> lava<00:02:46.550> or<00:02:46.820> fire<00:02:47.060> they

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
can't be damaged by lava or fire they

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.770 
can't be damaged by lava or fire they
just<00:02:47.840> swallow<00:02:48.110> up<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.530> destroyed<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
just swallow up here destroyed the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.970 
just swallow up here destroyed the
obsidian<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:53.060> also<00:02:53.330> made<00:02:53.720> me<00:02:53.750> loose<00:02:54.050> now

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
obsidian and that also made me loose now

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.760 
obsidian and that also made me loose now
for<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.700> engineers<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.420> spiders<00:02:56.770> the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
for the engineers and the spiders the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.370 
for the engineers and the spiders the
engineers<00:02:58.220> basically<00:02:59.090> use<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> trees<00:03:00.200> around

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
engineers basically use the trees around

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.590 
engineers basically use the trees around
for<00:03:01.100> ladders<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.450> then<00:03:02.690> climbed<00:03:02.989> away<00:03:03.230> across

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
for ladders and then climbed away across

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.940 
for ladders and then climbed away across
what<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.080> outer<00:03:06.260> ring<00:03:06.500> was<00:03:06.680> for

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
what that's what this outer ring was for

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.900 
what that's what this outer ring was for
is<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.280> destroy<00:03:07.700> most<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:09.700> engineers<00:03:10.700> that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
is to destroy most of the engineers that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.009 
is to destroy most of the engineers that
tried<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:13.430> engineers<00:03:13.880> bridges<00:03:14.269> these

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
tried to the engineers bridges these

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.960 
tried to the engineers bridges these
holes<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.650> ceiling<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.670> from<00:03:16.850> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
holes in the ceiling are from the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.729 
holes in the ceiling are from the
throwers<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.600> some<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.110> other<00:03:18.230> holes<00:03:18.470> are

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
throwers and some of the other holes are

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.970 
throwers and some of the other holes are
from<00:03:18.970> engineers<00:03:19.970> digging<00:03:20.299> straight<00:03:20.660> down<00:03:20.980> so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
from engineers digging straight down so

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.410 
from engineers digging straight down so
yeah<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:24.739> castle<00:03:25.190> did<00:03:25.430> last<00:03:25.700> me<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> long<00:03:26.150> time

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
yeah this castle did last me a long time

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.699 
yeah this castle did last me a long time
it's<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.380> know<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.500> couple

it's just that you know a couple

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.190 
it's just that you know a couple
problems<00:03:29.019> otherwise<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:32.200> pretty

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
problems otherwise this was a pretty

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.800 
problems otherwise this was a pretty
good<00:03:33.470> for<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:33.830> mod<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.269> want<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.600> will

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
good for this mod so if you want it will

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.100 
good for this mod so if you want it will
be<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.620> description<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:38.680> yeah<00:03:39.680> oh<00:03:41.110> yeah

one<00:03:42.290> more<00:03:42.320> thing<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.709> brought<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:43.160> point<00:03:43.370> out<00:03:43.489> I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
one more thing I brought to point out I

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.580 
one more thing I brought to point out I
also<00:03:44.239> made<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.079> that<00:03:46.000> was<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.590> monsters

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
also made it so that was it if monsters

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.360 
also made it so that was it if monsters
were<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.950> come<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.370> way

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
were to come this way

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.459 
were to come this way
yet<00:03:52.370> some<00:03:52.879> of<00:03:52.999> them<00:03:53.120> would<00:03:53.239> also<00:03:53.749> dig<00:03:54.230> straight

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:54.469 
yet some of them would also dig straight

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.640 
yet some of them would also dig straight
down<00:03:54.560> here<00:03:55.129> they'd<00:03:55.549> end<00:03:55.760> up<00:03:55.879> dying<00:03:56.439> those<00:03:57.439> who

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
down here they'd end up dying those who

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.619 
down here they'd end up dying those who
got<00:03:57.859> over<00:03:58.040> here<00:03:58.310> would<00:03:58.489> just<00:03:58.700> jump<00:03:58.760> off<00:03:59.239> kill

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
got over here would just jump off kill

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.610 
got over here would just jump off kill
themselves<00:04:00.049> on<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.319> cacti<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:02.439> the<00:04:03.439> ones

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
themselves on this cacti and the ones

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.959 
themselves on this cacti and the ones
who<00:04:03.739> made<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.010> here<00:04:04.249> they<00:04:04.430> just<00:04:04.459> ended<00:04:04.849> up

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
who made it here they just ended up

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.750 
who made it here they just ended up
dying<00:04:05.120> from<00:04:05.359> that<00:04:05.510> lava<00:04:06.280> after<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.340> point<00:04:07.670> out

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
dying from that lava after I point out

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.289 
dying from that lava after I point out
that<00:04:08.030> out<00:04:08.420> does<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.750> underground<00:04:09.200> section

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
that out does the underground section

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.809 
that out does the underground section
the<00:04:11.299> glass<00:04:12.049> was<00:04:12.290> for<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.280> could<00:04:13.430> see

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
the glass was for so that I could see

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.849 
the glass was for so that I could see
all<00:04:13.969> around<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.629> there's<00:04:15.079> no<00:04:15.260> light<00:04:15.469> except

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
all around and there's no light except

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.300 
all around and there's no light except
for<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.720> fire<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.989> glowstone<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:19.099> it's

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
for a fire and glowstone so it's

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.729 
for a fire and glowstone so it's
basically<00:04:19.519> pretty<00:04:19.910> much<00:04:20.030> lit<00:04:20.389> up<00:04:20.539> oh<00:04:20.780> it's

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
basically pretty much lit up oh it's
