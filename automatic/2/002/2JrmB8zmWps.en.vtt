now<00:00:00.570> using<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.350> universal<00:00:01.709> order<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.850> notes

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
now using the universal order of notes

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.720 
now using the universal order of notes
we<00:00:05.100> can<00:00:05.370> find<00:00:05.970> where<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.330> other<00:00:06.509> chords<00:00:07.730> are

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
we can find where the other chords are

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.049 
we can find where the other chords are
on<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> neck<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> guitar<00:00:10.820> since<00:00:11.820> all

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
on the neck of the guitar since all

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.730 
on the neck of the guitar since all
cords<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.630> movable<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.290> I've<00:00:13.410> said<00:00:13.590> that

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
cords are movable and I've said that

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.950 
cords are movable and I've said that
before<00:00:13.849> we<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.030> move<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.599> down<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
before we can move them up and down the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.540 
before we can move them up and down the
neck<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> find<00:00:16.590> where<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> other<00:00:16.949> chords<00:00:17.340> are

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
neck to find where the other chords are

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.349 
neck to find where the other chords are
so<00:00:18.449> let's<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.800> minor<00:00:20.130> chord<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.210> we're

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so let's take an a minor chord and we're

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.640 
so let's take an a minor chord and we're
going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.510> finger<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.170> these<00:00:22.350> three

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
going to finger it with these three

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
going to finger it with these three
fingers<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.039> leave<00:00:23.340> out<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.670> index<00:00:24.000> finger

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
fingers and leave out the index finger

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.580 
fingers and leave out the index finger
because<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:24.930> our<00:00:25.050> bar<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
because that's going to do our bar and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.400 
because that's going to do our bar and
right<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.789> are<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> minor

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.650 

if<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.100> move<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.430> whole<00:00:31.610> chord<00:00:31.940> up<00:00:32.090> one<00:00:32.360> fret

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
if you move the whole chord up one fret

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.040 
if you move the whole chord up one fret
and<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:33.500> bar<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:34.180> now<00:00:35.180> it's<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.570> b-flat

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
and then bar like that now it's a b-flat

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.660 
and then bar like that now it's a b-flat
minor<00:00:36.470> or<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.980> sharp

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.060 

one<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:41.909> fret<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.539> B<00:00:42.839> minor

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.389 

and<00:00:46.610> one<00:00:46.790> we're<00:00:46.970> free<00:00:47.210> after<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.720> see

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.939 

first<00:00:51.399> question<00:00:51.969> that<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.210> asked<00:00:52.539> myself<00:00:52.949> when

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
first question that I asked myself when

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.069 
first question that I asked myself when
I<00:00:54.039> was<00:00:54.070> looking<00:00:54.730> at<00:00:54.820> instructional<00:00:55.570> books<00:00:55.839> is

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
I was looking at instructional books is

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.349 
I was looking at instructional books is
how<00:00:56.230> could<00:00:56.440> they<00:00:56.559> don't<00:00:56.769> show<00:00:57.550> like<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.089> C

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
how could they don't show like the C

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.860 
how could they don't show like the C
minor<00:00:58.629> chord<00:00:59.079> in<00:00:59.350> an<00:00:59.469> open<00:00:59.829> position<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.629> for

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
minor chord in an open position but for

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.460 
minor chord in an open position but for
one<00:01:02.019> thing<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.640> play<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:04.180> C<00:01:04.479> minor<00:01:04.750> chord<00:01:05.199> and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
one thing to play a C minor chord and

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.320 
one thing to play a C minor chord and
the<00:01:05.979> way<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.250> minor<00:01:06.580> chord<00:01:07.000> gets

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
the way this minor chord gets

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.660 
the way this minor chord gets
constructed<00:01:08.170> as<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.740> take<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.100> third<00:01:09.130> out<00:01:09.640> of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
constructed as you take the third out of

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.219 
constructed as you take the third out of
your<00:01:09.820> scale<00:01:11.399> flattened<00:01:12.399> my<00:01:12.759> god<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:14.049> that's

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
your scale flattened my god and that's

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.370 
your scale flattened my god and that's
that<00:01:14.820> determines<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.970> minor<00:01:16.180> sound

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.130 

now<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:22.119> next<00:01:22.270> ring<00:01:22.659> ah

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
now the next ring ah

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.819 
now the next ring ah
sounds<00:01:25.140> terrible<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.979> sequences<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
sounds terrible for sequences so you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.200 
sounds terrible for sequences so you
have<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> raise<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> make<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.969> I<00:01:30.000> see

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
have to raise it up to make that I see

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.849 
have to raise it up to make that I see
now<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.359> fingering<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.619> difficult

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
now that fingering is really difficult

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:38.460 
now that fingering is really difficult
to<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.990> even<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.289> that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.399 

the<00:01:39.470> open<00:01:39.770> E<00:01:39.890> string<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.780> they<00:01:41.930> don't<00:01:42.350> even

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the open E string so they don't even

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.190 
the open E string so they don't even
show<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.979> cord<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:44.390> your<00:01:44.570> instructional

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
show you that cord in your instructional

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.160 
show you that cord in your instructional
books<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.790> better<00:01:47.000> way<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.300> play<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.870> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
books but the better way to play it the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.719 
books but the better way to play it the
better<00:01:48.320> sounding<00:01:48.830> one<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.130> actually<00:01:49.340> take

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
better sounding one is actually take

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.420 
better sounding one is actually take
that<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:50.060> minor<00:01:50.330> chord<00:01:50.690> come<00:01:51.110> up<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:51.560> two<00:01:52.010> three

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
that a minor chord come up one two three

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.850 
that a minor chord come up one two three
frets<00:01:52.790> play<00:01:53.660> there<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.020> need<00:01:54.229> your<00:01:54.380> C<00:01:54.650> minor

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
frets play there to need your C minor

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.460 
frets play there to need your C minor
chord<00:01:55.300> that's<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.509> advantage<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.290> knowing

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
chord that's the advantage of knowing

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.040 
chord that's the advantage of knowing
how<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.770> move<00:01:58.070> towards<00:01:58.640> up<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.750> down<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
how to move towards up and down the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.200 
how to move towards up and down the
fretboard<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.650> just<00:02:00.860> course<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.790> can't<00:02:02.000> play

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
fretboard is just course you can't play

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
fretboard is just course you can't play
any<00:02:02.360> other<00:02:02.479> way<00:02:08.259> that's<00:02:09.259> how<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.440> find<00:02:09.679> chords

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
any other way that's how you find chords

any other way that's how you find chords
