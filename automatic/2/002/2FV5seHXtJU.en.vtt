been able to run the ball here and it's
not<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.250> point<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.760> felt<00:05:32.150> like<00:05:32.410> offensively

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
not a point I felt like offensively

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.650 
not a point I felt like offensively
where<00:05:33.650> we<00:05:33.710> could<00:05:33.920> match<00:05:34.070> up<00:05:34.100> up<00:05:34.490> front<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:35.480> we

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
where we could match up up front and we

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.330 
where we could match up up front and we
talked<00:05:35.960> about<00:05:36.110> their<00:05:36.410> people<00:05:36.830> certainly

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
talked about their people certainly

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.800 
talked about their people certainly
defensively<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.000> did<00:05:38.150> not<00:05:38.330> think<00:05:38.570> they<00:05:38.750> could

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
defensively I did not think they could

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.930 
defensively I did not think they could
run<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.200> ball<00:05:39.380> on<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.740> but<00:05:39.980> I<00:05:40.190> was<00:05:40.640> giving

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
run the ball on this but I was giving

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.550 
run the ball on this but I was giving
them<00:05:41.030> a<00:05:41.090> lot<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.240> credit<00:05:41.420> before<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.080> game<00:05:42.260> I

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
them a lot of credit before the game I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.230 
them a lot of credit before the game I
think<00:05:42.920> that<00:05:43.340> when<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:43.910> look<00:05:43.940> at<00:05:44.150> our

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
think that when you look at our

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.460 
think that when you look at our
offensive<00:05:44.690> line<00:05:44.750> he's<00:05:45.110> looked<00:05:45.290> at<00:05:45.380> our

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
offensive line he's looked at our

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.810 
offensive line he's looked at our
running<00:05:45.740> backs<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.160> you<00:05:46.220> throw<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.670> in<00:05:46.760> the

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
running backs and you throw it in the

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.070 
running backs and you throw it in the
option<00:05:47.270> game<00:05:47.450> and<00:05:49.510> certainly<00:05:50.510> let<00:05:50.810> me<00:05:50.900> just

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
option game and certainly let me just

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.659 
option game and certainly let me just
ask<00:05:51.200> you<00:05:51.320> one<00:05:51.470> question<00:05:51.680> what<00:05:52.280> happened<00:05:52.580> on
