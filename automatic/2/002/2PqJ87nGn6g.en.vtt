00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
recommend it but if you wanted to do it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
recommend it but if you wanted to do it
from<00:00:49.260> time<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.590> time<00:00:49.910> it'll<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.390> great

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
from time to time it'll be a great

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
multi-touch touchscreen so we can do all

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
multi-touch touchscreen so we can do all
sorts<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.449> cool<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.320> course<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
sorts of cool things and of course I I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.549 
sorts of cool things and of course I I
think<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.670> Windows<00:01:02.969> 8<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.080> perfect

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
think that Windows 8 is you know perfect

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.780 
think that Windows 8 is you know perfect
for<00:01:04.710> touch<00:01:04.860> screens<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
for touch screens I don't think it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
for touch screens I don't think it
always<00:01:06.119> works<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> best<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.290> desktops<00:01:07.920> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
always works the best on desktops but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.859 
always works the best on desktops but
with<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> you've<00:01:10.229> got<00:01:10.439> plenty

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
with this you know you've got plenty

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.830 
with this you know you've got plenty
plenty<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.110> room<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.680> play<00:01:13.860> around<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.840> the

which<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> surprising<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.630> an

which is surprising you know for an

which is surprising you know for an
all-in-one<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.229> wouldn't<00:01:25.530> necessarily

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
all-in-one we wouldn't necessarily

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.060 
all-in-one we wouldn't necessarily
expect<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.380> solid<00:01:28.380> graphics<00:01:28.829> card

expect it to have a solid graphics card
like<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> does<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.110> comes

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like that but it does and also I comes

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
like that but it does and also I comes
running<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:33.890> Intel<00:01:34.890> Core<00:01:35.549> i5<00:01:35.850> 32<00:01:36.780> 10<00:01:36.960> mm<00:01:37.320> of

that's a dual core processor so it's not

that's a dual core processor so it's not
the<00:01:42.990> best<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.590> tend<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.729> ultrabook<00:01:45.299> when

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the best I tend to think ultrabook when

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
the best I tend to think ultrabook when
I<00:01:45.509> hear<00:01:45.750> Core<00:01:45.990> i5<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.610> every

I hear Core i5 just because every

I hear Core i5 just because every

ultrabook under the Sun uses a core i5

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.359 
ultrabook under the Sun uses a core i5
it<00:01:50.939> seems<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.409> got<00:01:52.560> some<00:01:52.770> limitations

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it seems so you got some limitations

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.359 
it seems so you got some limitations
with<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:54.290> 8<00:01:55.290> gigabytes<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> RAM<00:01:56.070> below

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with that one 8 gigabytes of RAM below

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.530 
with that one 8 gigabytes of RAM below
and<00:01:56.899> this<00:01:57.979> makes<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.430> capable<00:01:59.759> gaming

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and this makes a pretty capable gaming

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
and this makes a pretty capable gaming
machine<00:02:00.960> surprisingly

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
machine surprisingly

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
interestingly the power cord plugs in to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.229 
interestingly the power cord plugs in to
the<00:04:11.420> bottom<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.930> this<00:04:12.680> end<00:04:13.100> here<00:04:13.489> which<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:14.120> a

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
the bottom of this end here which is a

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.420 
the bottom of this end here which is a
very<00:04:14.570> solid<00:04:15.140> end<00:04:15.440> I'm<00:04:15.620> never<00:04:15.890> worried<00:04:16.250> about

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
very solid end I'm never worried about

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.599 
very solid end I'm never worried about
this<00:04:16.609> computer<00:04:17.739> falling<00:04:18.739> over<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.780> mean<00:04:20.780> what

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
this computer falling over I mean what

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.580 
this computer falling over I mean what
good<00:04:21.939> because<00:04:22.330> it's<00:04:22.509> an<00:04:22.629> expensive<00:04:22.840> computer

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
good because it's an expensive computer

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.360 
good because it's an expensive computer
I<00:04:24.120> spent<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.240> good<00:04:25.389> few<00:04:25.720> minutes<00:04:26.080> when<00:04:27.009> I<00:04:27.039> first

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
I spent a good few minutes when I first

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.860 
I spent a good few minutes when I first
pulled<00:04:27.580> this<00:04:27.759> thing<00:04:27.819> out<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.270> box<00:04:28.479> trying

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
pulled this thing out of the box trying

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.939 
pulled this thing out of the box trying
to<00:04:29.050> find<00:04:29.439> where<00:04:30.129> I<00:04:30.159> plug<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.849> power<00:04:31.000> into

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
to find where I plug the power into

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.770 
to find where I plug the power into
until<00:04:32.949> I<00:04:32.979> noticed<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.669> it's<00:04:34.270> on<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.509> edge<00:04:34.659> of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
until I noticed that it's on the edge of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.570 
until I noticed that it's on the edge of
the<00:04:34.990> stand<00:04:35.289> which<00:04:35.530> annoyed<00:04:35.800> me<00:04:36.009> at<00:04:36.129> first<00:04:36.370> but

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the stand which annoyed me at first but

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.219 
the stand which annoyed me at first but
I<00:04:36.759> kind<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.120> like<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.419> because<00:04:37.689> it<00:04:37.810> keeps<00:04:37.960> this

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
I kind of like it because it keeps this

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.409 
I kind of like it because it keeps this
area<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.889> little<00:04:39.430> more<00:04:39.610> clear<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.180> know<00:04:40.270> you're

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
area a little more clear you know you're

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.179 
area a little more clear you know you're
gonna<00:04:40.509> have<00:04:40.599> cords<00:04:41.199> coming<00:04:41.439> out<00:04:41.680> all<00:04:42.129> over

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
gonna have cords coming out all over

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.649 
gonna have cords coming out all over
back<00:04:42.969> here<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:45.490> it's<00:04:45.669> just<00:04:45.759> one<00:04:46.090> less<00:04:46.240> part<00:04:46.539> it

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
back here so it's just one less part it

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.119 
back here so it's just one less part it
stays<00:04:46.840> out<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.199> way<00:04:47.319> one<00:04:47.560> last<00:04:47.590> word<00:04:47.949> to

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
stays out of the way one last word to

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.800 
stays out of the way one last word to
get<00:04:48.250> tangled<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:48.849> that<00:04:48.969> mess<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.569> is

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
get tangled in that mess that is

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.230 
get tangled in that mess that is
inevitable<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:53.169> hey<00:04:53.379> I'm<00:04:53.860> all<00:04:54.069> for<00:04:54.099> that<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
inevitable so hey I'm all for that and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.089 
inevitable so hey I'm all for that and
then<00:04:55.419> very<00:04:55.960> quickly<00:04:56.080> on<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:59.440> left<00:04:59.650> side<00:04:59.889> again

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
then very quickly on the left side again

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.209 
then very quickly on the left side again
let's<00:05:00.430> get<00:05:00.610> this<00:05:00.759> out<00:05:00.969> of<00:05:01.000> there<00:05:01.240> on<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:03.039> left

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
let's get this out of there on the left

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.730 
let's get this out of there on the left
side<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:03.909> just<00:05:03.940> have<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.750> blu-ray<00:05:05.080> drive<00:05:05.379> and

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
side we just have the blu-ray drive and

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.890 
side we just have the blu-ray drive and
the<00:05:06.550> eject<00:05:06.819> button<00:05:06.879> for<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.360> blu-ray<00:05:07.539> drive

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
the eject button for the blu-ray drive

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.510 
the eject button for the blu-ray drive
there's<00:05:08.379> a<00:05:08.440> grill<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.830> speaker<00:05:09.129> there's<00:05:09.460> a

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
there's a grill of a speaker there's a

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.170 
there's a grill of a speaker there's a
grill<00:05:09.789> four<00:05:10.060> speakers<00:05:10.330> along<00:05:11.319> the<00:05:11.590> top<00:05:11.860> so

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050 

speakers<00:05:16.180> are<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.479> right<00:05:17.400> they<00:05:18.400> aren't<00:05:18.909> the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
speakers are all right they aren't the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.390 
speakers are all right they aren't the
best<00:05:19.240> they<00:05:20.229> have<00:05:20.409> a<00:05:20.439> tendency<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:20.979> sound<00:05:21.279> a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
best they have a tendency to sound a

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.839 
best they have a tendency to sound a
little<00:05:21.639> tinny<00:05:21.939> at<00:05:22.300> times<00:05:23.400> they<00:05:24.400> can<00:05:24.639> get

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
little tinny at times they can get

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.140 
little tinny at times they can get
really<00:05:25.330> loud<00:05:25.509> low<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:26.909> wouldn't<00:05:27.909> advise

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
really loud low I wouldn't advise

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.809 
really loud low I wouldn't advise
turning<00:05:28.539> them<00:05:28.659> away<00:05:29.289> because<00:05:30.129> that's<00:05:30.550> when

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
turning them away because that's when

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.580 
turning them away because that's when
the<00:05:30.940> tininess<00:05:31.330> really<00:05:31.659> starts<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.139> come

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
the tininess really starts to come

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.309 
the tininess really starts to come
through<00:05:32.770> bass<00:05:33.190> doesn't<00:05:33.639> seem<00:05:33.879> as<00:05:34.150> strong<00:05:34.930> as

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
through bass doesn't seem as strong as

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.629 
through bass doesn't seem as strong as
it<00:05:35.919> should<00:05:36.539> but<00:05:37.539> that<00:05:37.599> decent<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.319> you<00:05:39.190> have<00:05:39.430> it

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
it should but that decent I you have it

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.540 
it should but that decent I you have it
if<00:05:39.849> you<00:05:40.060> have<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> pair<00:05:40.539> of<00:05:40.569> good<00:05:40.779> headphones<00:05:41.550> on

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
if you have a pair of good headphones on

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.909 
if you have a pair of good headphones on
hand<00:05:42.909> I<00:05:43.029> would<00:05:43.270> recommend<00:05:44.110> plugging<00:05:44.319> those<00:05:44.650> in

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
hand I would recommend plugging those in

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.050 
hand I would recommend plugging those in
and<00:05:45.159> using<00:05:45.759> those<00:05:45.940> but<00:05:46.900> wrapping<00:05:47.889> it<00:05:48.009> up<00:05:48.099> it's

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
and using those but wrapping it up it's

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.200 
and using those but wrapping it up it's
a<00:05:49.240> pretty<00:05:49.389> it's<00:05:49.839> a<00:05:50.139> nice<00:05:50.349> computer<00:05:51.180> you've<00:05:52.180> got

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
a pretty it's a nice computer you've got

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.760 
a pretty it's a nice computer you've got
plenty<00:05:52.539> of<00:05:52.629> storage<00:05:52.900> from<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.349> start<00:05:53.589> you've

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
plenty of storage from the start you've

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.209 
plenty of storage from the start you've
got<00:05:54.210> one<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.659> one<00:05:56.080> terabyte<00:05:56.500> hard<00:05:56.710> drive<00:05:56.979> so

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
got one a one terabyte hard drive so

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.559 
got one a one terabyte hard drive so
that<00:05:57.370> should<00:05:57.580> keep<00:05:57.759> you<00:05:57.879> going<00:05:57.909> for<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.419> little

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
that should keep you going for a little

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.540 
that should keep you going for a little
while<00:05:58.810> at<00:05:59.110> least<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:02.229> a<00:06:02.620> little<00:06:03.190> on<00:06:03.400> the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
while at least but it's a little on the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.749 
while at least but it's a little on the
expensive<00:06:03.759> side<00:06:04.120> I<00:06:04.300> feel<00:06:04.719> it's<00:06:05.279> $1,900<00:06:06.279> one

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
expensive side I feel it's $1,900 one

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.869 
expensive side I feel it's $1,900 one
thousand<00:06:07.120> eight<00:06:07.180> ninety<00:06:07.509> nine<00:06:07.719> I<00:06:08.080> believe

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:08.879 
thousand eight ninety nine I believe

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.969 
thousand eight ninety nine I believe
which<00:06:09.879> it's<00:06:10.690> got<00:06:10.900> some<00:06:11.110> good<00:06:11.289> hardware<00:06:11.680> in<00:06:11.830> it

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
which it's got some good hardware in it

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.890 
which it's got some good hardware in it
and<00:06:12.250> it's<00:06:12.699> got<00:06:12.789> a<00:06:12.849> beautiful<00:06:13.089> screen<00:06:13.629> but<00:06:13.870> I

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
and it's got a beautiful screen but I

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.579 
and it's got a beautiful screen but I
just<00:06:14.139> feel<00:06:14.349> like<00:06:14.520> $1,900<00:06:15.520> is<00:06:15.699> going<00:06:15.879> to<00:06:15.940> be<00:06:16.589> too
