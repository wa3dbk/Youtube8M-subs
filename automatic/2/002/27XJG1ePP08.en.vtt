the time I use dragon naturallyspeaking
which<00:00:46.250> is<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.460> dictation<00:00:47.000> software<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.980> there

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
which is a dictation software but there

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.650 
which is a dictation software but there
are<00:00:49.219> certain<00:00:49.489> things<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.789> dragon<00:00:50.270> won't<00:00:50.449> do

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
are certain things that dragon won't do

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.740 
are certain things that dragon won't do
very<00:00:50.930> well<00:00:51.609> ironically<00:00:52.609> it<00:00:52.699> doesn't<00:00:53.300> drag<00:00:53.539> the

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
very well ironically it doesn't drag the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.959 
very well ironically it doesn't drag the
mouse<00:00:53.899> very<00:00:54.260> well<00:00:54.579> despite<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.609> fact<00:00:55.850> that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
allow me to drag it all so i wanted to

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.890 
allow me to drag it all so i wanted to
find<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.300> way<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.510> use<00:01:08.930> an<00:01:09.310> arduino<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:11.240> simulate

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
find a way to use an arduino to simulate

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.530 
find a way to use an arduino to simulate
a<00:01:12.049> mouse<00:01:12.259> or<00:01:12.530> keyboard<00:01:13.180> because<00:01:14.180> every<00:01:14.509> once

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
a mouse or keyboard because every once

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.109 
a mouse or keyboard because every once
around<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.080> voice<00:01:15.290> program<00:01:15.590> will<00:01:16.430> rock<00:01:16.640> up<00:01:16.880> or

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
around the voice program will rock up or

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.170 
around the voice program will rock up or
there<00:01:17.330> are<00:01:17.360> things<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.750> can't<00:01:17.990> do<00:01:18.170> with<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:19.430> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
there are things I can't do with it if I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.670 
there are things I can't do with it if I
was<00:01:20.330> going<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.540> use<00:01:20.600> an<00:01:20.900> ill<00:01:21.080> know<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:21.500> was

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
was going to use an ill know which was

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.219 
was going to use an ill know which was
all<00:01:21.829> I<00:01:21.860> knew<00:01:22.130> about<00:01:22.159> at<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.640> beginning<00:01:23.079> it<00:01:24.079> was

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
all I knew about at the beginning it was

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.560 
all I knew about at the beginning it was
going<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.439> be<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> real<00:01:24.799> hassle<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.420> to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
going to be a real hassle you have to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.270 
going to be a real hassle you have to
reflash<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:28.509> USB<00:01:29.509> controller<00:01:29.960> firmware<00:01:30.799> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
reflash the USB controller firmware and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.510 
reflash the USB controller firmware and
then<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.329> have<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.570> use<00:01:32.689> isps<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:34.189> upload<00:01:34.490> your

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
then you have to use isps to upload your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.330 
then you have to use isps to upload your
sketches<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.570> can't<00:01:35.780> use<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
sketches because you can't use the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.569 
sketches because you can't use the
regular<00:01:37.340> USB<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.600> upload<00:01:38.899> sketches<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.590> was

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
regular USB to upload sketches I was

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.740 
regular USB to upload sketches I was
going<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.820> have<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.000> learn<00:01:41.119> all<00:01:41.360> sorts<00:01:41.540> of

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
going to have to learn all sorts of

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.899 
going to have to learn all sorts of
stuff<00:01:41.810> about<00:01:42.200> human<00:01:43.130> interface<00:01:43.520> device

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
stuff about human interface device

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.690 
stuff about human interface device
protocols<00:01:44.540> for<00:01:44.869> four<00:01:45.740> USB<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.340> was<00:01:46.460> really

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
protocols for four USB it was really

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.999 
protocols for four USB it was really
going<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.880> be<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:46.970> hassle

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
going to be a hassle

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.130 
going to be a hassle
so<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.369> kept<00:01:50.030> putting<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:50.329> off<00:01:50.479> putting<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.990> off

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
so I kept putting it off putting it off

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.469 
so I kept putting it off putting it off
finally<00:01:52.009> one<00:01:52.159> day<00:01:52.219> I<00:01:52.340> said<00:01:52.640> okay<00:01:52.909> let's<00:01:53.060> do<00:01:53.329> it

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
finally one day I said okay let's do it

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.649 
finally one day I said okay let's do it
I<00:01:53.659> do<00:01:54.439> one<00:01:54.710> last<00:01:54.979> Google<00:01:55.399> search<00:01:55.640> how<00:01:56.390> do<00:01:56.450> you

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
I do one last Google search how do you

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.130 
I do one last Google search how do you
use<00:01:56.929> it<00:01:56.960> a'dreea<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.770> simulate<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.340> mouse<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.140> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
use it a'dreea to simulate a mouse and a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.410 
use it a'dreea to simulate a mouse and a
new<00:02:00.289> link<00:02:00.500> popped<00:02:00.799> up<00:02:01.390> introducing<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
new link popped up introducing the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.499 
new link popped up introducing the
adrenal<00:02:03.079> Leonardo<00:02:03.909> I'd<00:02:04.909> never<00:02:05.149> heard<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
adrenal Leonardo I'd never heard of that

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.380 
adrenal Leonardo I'd never heard of that
before<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.200> looked<00:02:06.469> at<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.090> what<00:02:08.090> was

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
before so I looked at it and what was

before so I looked at it and what was
going<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.780> be<00:02:08.869> incredibly<00:02:09.649> difficult<00:02:10.269> was<00:02:11.269> now

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
going to be incredibly difficult was now

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.770 
going to be incredibly difficult was now
going<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.870> be<00:02:12.019> insanely<00:02:12.620> easy<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.239> Leonardo

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
going to be insanely easy the Leonardo

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.860 
going to be insanely easy the Leonardo
is<00:02:14.959> especially<00:02:15.590> designed<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:17.150> be<00:02:17.239> used<00:02:17.269> as<00:02:17.840> a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
is especially designed to be used as a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.229 
is especially designed to be used as a
mouse<00:02:18.140> or<00:02:18.379> keyboard<00:02:18.730> emulator<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.090> has

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
mouse or keyboard emulator it has

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.319 
mouse or keyboard emulator it has
libraries<00:02:21.079> built-in<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:22.400> does<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.849> all<00:02:22.970> for

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
libraries built-in it does it all for

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.729 
libraries built-in it does it all for
you<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:24.410> was<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.769> crazy<00:02:25.459> easy<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:27.319> here's<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
you it was just crazy easy so here's a

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.420 
you it was just crazy easy so here's a
photo<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> built<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.079> used<00:02:30.860> Adafruit
