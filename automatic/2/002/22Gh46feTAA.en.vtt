00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
of nature stinks to high heaven for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
of nature stinks to high heaven for
about<00:01:00.359> two<00:01:00.629> days<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.859> full<00:01:02.160> bloom

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
about two days when it's in full bloom

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
about two days when it's in full bloom
because<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.449> meant<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> attract<00:01:04.320> insects

for the purposes of pollination

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
for the purposes of pollination
I<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> unpleasant<00:01:08.670> fragrance<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I think the unpleasant fragrance is the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
I think the unpleasant fragrance is the
primary<00:01:09.869> reason<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
primary reason you don't see it as a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060 
primary reason you don't see it as a
common<00:01:12.150> house<00:01:12.330> plant<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> looks<00:01:14.010> like

fluorescent I wanted to show you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.370 
fluorescent I wanted to show you
something<00:02:04.430> else<00:02:04.550> too<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.870> beginning

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
something else too this is the beginning

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.220 
something else too this is the beginning
of<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.530> hole<00:02:06.740> across<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.670> about<00:02:08.210> two<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.020> a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
of the hole across is about two and a

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.520 
of the hole across is about two and a
half<00:02:09.470> inches<00:02:10.190> I'm<00:02:10.820> going<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.300> move<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.780> ruler

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
half inches I'm going to move a ruler

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.340 
half inches I'm going to move a ruler
down<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.280> take<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> finer<00:02:14.510> look<00:02:14.870> at<00:02:15.050> this

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
down so we can take a finer look at this

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.070 
down so we can take a finer look at this
I<00:02:17.050> think<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.490> maybe<00:02:20.180> by<00:02:20.450> my<00:02:20.660> hand

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
I think you can see and maybe by my hand

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.570 
I think you can see and maybe by my hand
just<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:23.030> size<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.780> hole<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:25.190> maybe<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
just the size of the hole here maybe the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.190 
just the size of the hole here maybe the
ruler<00:02:25.850> doesn't<00:02:26.030> help<00:02:26.390> very<00:02:26.660> much<00:02:26.780> and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
ruler doesn't help very much and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.310 
ruler doesn't help very much and
something<00:02:27.830> else<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.220> noticed<00:02:28.760> look<00:02:29.690> at<00:02:29.900> this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
something else I noticed look at this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.710 
something else I noticed look at this
this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.800> straight<00:02:31.490> tuber<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.060> worked<00:02:32.540> its

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
this is a straight tuber that worked its

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.490 
this is a straight tuber that worked its
way<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.470> dirt<00:02:34.510> he's<00:02:35.510> fine<00:02:35.870> he<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.170> sit

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
way out of the dirt he's fine he can sit

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.780 
way out of the dirt he's fine he can sit
here<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.830> wait<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> rest<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> winter

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
here and wait for the rest of the winter

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490 
here and wait for the rest of the winter
before<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.360> put<00:02:38.810> him<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> dirt<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
before I put him in the dirt in the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.830 
before I put him in the dirt in the
spring<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.160> dry<00:02:40.520> they<00:02:41.239> don't<00:02:41.480> need<00:02:41.630> any

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
spring it's dry they don't need any

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.380 
spring it's dry they don't need any
extra<00:02:42.230> care<00:02:42.470> usually<00:02:42.739> they<00:02:43.220> sit<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> pot

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
extra care usually they sit in the pot

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.900 
extra care usually they sit in the pot
under<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.410> dirt<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.160> really<00:02:46.580> doesn't

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
under the dirt but it really doesn't

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.340 
under the dirt but it really doesn't
make<00:02:47.120> any<00:02:47.270> difference<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.870> it'll<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.200> just

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
make any difference to it it'll be just

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.680 
make any difference to it it'll be just
fine<00:02:48.470> until<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.100> plant<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.940> spring<00:02:50.120> and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
fine until I plant it in the spring and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.270 
fine until I plant it in the spring and
we'll<00:02:51.650> take<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:51.890> look<00:02:52.580> again<00:02:52.730> here<00:02:53.209> at<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
we'll take a look again here at the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.050 
we'll take a look again here at the
beginnings<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.459> what<00:02:55.520> we're<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.910> be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
beginnings of what we're going to be

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.640 
beginnings of what we're going to be
watching<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.780> next<00:02:57.020> several<00:02:57.230> weeks

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
watching for the next several weeks

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
watching for the next several weeks
until<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.880> get<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.480> fabulous<00:03:00.250> bloom<00:03:01.250> out<00:03:01.520> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
until we get a fabulous bloom out of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.650 
until we get a fabulous bloom out of
this

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:30.600 

I<00:03:28.560> never<00:03:29.560> dreamed<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:30.100> would<00:03:30.190> turn<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.580> to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
I never dreamed it would turn out to

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.810 
I never dreamed it would turn out to
look<00:03:31.060> quite<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:32.110> beautiful<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.640> really
