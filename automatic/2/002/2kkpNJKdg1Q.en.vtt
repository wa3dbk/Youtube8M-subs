quieter<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> guess<00:01:04.260> turn-based<00:01:05.129> chess<00:01:06.000> game

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
quieter I guess turn-based chess game

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
now that's a game that I absolutely

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
now that's a game that I absolutely
loved<00:01:39.049> played<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> day

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
loved played a lot of it back in the day

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.899 
loved played a lot of it back in the day
both<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.759> GBA<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> DS<00:01:44.549> as

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
both on the GBA and then on the DS as

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.630 
both on the GBA and then on the DS as
well<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.409> new<00:01:46.680> feature<00:01:47.009> encoding

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
well but there's a new feature encoding

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
well but there's a new feature encoding
scheme<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:49.020> works<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.320> well

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
scheme that I think works really well

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
scheme that I think works really well
and<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> overwatch<00:01:50.490> mode<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.479> what

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
pain they decided to also do the same

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.470

thing so keep your fame of a piece in

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.690 
thing so keep your fame of a piece in
their<00:03:03.599> chess<00:03:03.840> game<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.099> unexpectedly

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
their chess game and they unexpectedly

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.759 
their chess game and they unexpectedly
move<00:03:06.629> into<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.079> place<00:03:07.170> where<00:03:07.530> they<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.650> be

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
move into a place where they can be

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.650 
move into a place where they can be
taken<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.670> undo<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> move<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.569> they

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
taken they can undo that move and they

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.360 
taken they can undo that move and they
can<00:03:09.840> move<00:03:10.049> back<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.859> gives<00:03:11.099> them<00:03:11.250> an

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
can move back it gives them an

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.250 
can move back it gives them an
opportunity<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.150> learn<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:12.959> their<00:03:13.230> mistakes

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
opportunity to learn from their mistakes

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.009 
opportunity to learn from their mistakes
so<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:14.370> clipping<00:03:15.060> steaming<00:03:15.480> cluding

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
so I think clipping steaming cluding

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.050 
so I think clipping steaming cluding
that<00:03:16.170> sort<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.410> rewind<00:03:16.920> feature<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.670> really

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
that sort of rewind feature is a really

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.210 
that sort of rewind feature is a really
clever<00:03:18.420> move<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.260> younger<00:03:19.470> players<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:20.010> you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
clever move the younger players as you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.650 
clever move the younger players as you
develop<00:03:20.370> obviously<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.239> turn<00:03:21.389> that<00:03:21.510> off

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
develop obviously you can turn that off

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.809 
develop obviously you can turn that off
on<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> high<00:03:22.019> difficulty<00:03:22.440> levels<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.069> that

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
on the high difficulty levels and that

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.940 
on the high difficulty levels and that
that<00:03:24.150> option<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.690> odor<00:03:25.019> retracing<00:03:25.829> your<00:03:25.859> steps

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
that option of odor retracing your steps
