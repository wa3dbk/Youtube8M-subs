00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
so Toledo so let us take some more

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.889 
so Toledo so let us take some more
examples

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.360 

this<00:00:06.899> time<00:00:07.109> Chile<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.379> conquered<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:07.950> head<00:00:08.220> let

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
this time Chile I conquered the head let

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.760 
this time Chile I conquered the head let
us<00:00:08.490> write<00:00:08.760> something<00:00:09.330> like<00:00:13.519> 1.67<00:00:14.519> bar<00:00:15.770> show

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
us write something like 1.67 bar show

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
us write something like 1.67 bar show
that<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.820> number<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.330> point<00:00:18.539> six<00:00:18.810> seven<00:00:18.960> bar

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
that the number one point six seven bar

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
that the number one point six seven bar
is<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> rational<00:00:19.980> number<00:00:20.010> yeah<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> memory

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
is a rational number yeah a memory

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.109 
is a rational number yeah a memory
question<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.769> again<00:00:23.369> how<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
question so again how are we going to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
question so again how are we going to
handle<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.570> those<00:00:24.990> two<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.130> are<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
handle this those two so we are going to

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.830 
handle this those two so we are going to
say<00:00:26.580> well<00:00:26.730> let<00:00:27.000> X<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.529> equal<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:30.269> point<00:00:30.570> six

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
say well let X is equal to one point six

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.459 
say well let X is equal to one point six
seven<00:00:31.560> bar<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.510> it's<00:00:33.510> come<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.840> lab<00:00:34.020> hey<00:00:34.200> what

and<00:00:51.629> seven<00:00:51.930> Cooper<00:00:52.260> head<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and seven Cooper head so we know what it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.720 
and seven Cooper head so we know what it
means<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.559> just<00:00:55.559> six<00:00:55.800> seven<00:00:56.129> number<00:00:56.460> here

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
means is that just six seven number here

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
means is that just six seven number here
they<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.570> repeating<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> six<00:00:58.289> seven<00:00:58.530> digits

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
they are repeating the six seven digits

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.790 
they are repeating the six seven digits
are<00:00:59.039> repeating<00:00:59.489> six<00:00:59.879> seven<00:01:00.320> six<00:01:01.320> seven<00:01:01.469> six

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
are repeating six seven six seven six

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.340 
are repeating six seven six seven six
seven<00:01:02.250> six<00:01:02.550> seven<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.140> bar

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
seven six seven so this is what this bar

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
seven six seven so this is what this bar
means<00:01:04.589> socially<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> conquered<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> head<00:01:06.330> let

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
means socially I conquered the head let

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.530 
means socially I conquered the head let
us<00:01:06.570> call<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> X<00:01:07.670> now<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> home<00:01:09.390> not

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
us call that X now a we have a home not

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
us call that X now a we have a home not
a<00:01:09.630> car<00:01:09.840> key<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.860> multiply<00:01:11.010> both<00:01:11.610> sides

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
a car key we have to multiply both sides

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.530 
a car key we have to multiply both sides
by<00:01:12.060> 10<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> power<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.159> something<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.390> we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
by 10 to the power of something so we

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.039 
by 10 to the power of something so we
say<00:01:15.689> okay<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:17.090> multiplying<00:01:20.330> Yaqui<00:01:21.330> equation

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
say okay so multiplying Yaqui equation

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.649 
say okay so multiplying Yaqui equation
here<00:01:22.400> multiplying<00:01:23.540> both<00:01:24.540> sides<00:01:26.659> multiplying

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
here multiplying both sides multiplying

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.730 
here multiplying both sides multiplying
both<00:01:28.439> sides<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:29.720> we<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.140> multiply<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
both sides by we have to multiply this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
both sides by we have to multiply this
by<00:01:32.009> 10<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> power<00:01:32.430> something<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.180> those

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
by 10 to the power something and those

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
by 10 to the power something and those
are<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:34.920> technique<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.270> technique

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
are what was our technique so technique

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
are what was our technique so technique
was<00:01:37.049> jitney<00:01:38.270> digits<00:01:39.270> repeat<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
was jitney digits repeat over here we

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
was jitney digits repeat over here we
have<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> multiply<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.390> 10<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> power

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have to multiply that by 10 to the power

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
have to multiply that by 10 to the power
that<00:01:43.770> number<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> though<00:01:45.060> digits

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that number so you have it though digits

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
that number so you have it though digits
repeat<00:01:45.720> over<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> multiply

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
repeat over here so we have to multiply

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
repeat over here so we have to multiply
this<00:01:47.880> by<00:01:48.149> 10<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> power<00:01:49.079> 2<00:01:49.380> which<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
this by 10 to the power 2 which is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
this by 10 to the power 2 which is
basically<00:01:50.850> nothing<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.600> 100<00:01:52.460> right<00:01:53.899> java

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
basically nothing but 100 right java

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
basically nothing but 100 right java
multiply<00:01:55.350> Callaham<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.479> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
multiply Callaham so what do we get so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.330 
multiply Callaham so what do we get so
we<00:01:58.140> get<00:02:00.409> 100<00:02:01.409> X<00:02:03.200> equal<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
we get 100 X equal to you have this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
we get 100 X equal to you have this

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.209 
what happens optimal M has a decimal
number<00:02:25.959> here<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.549> now<00:02:28.150> shift<00:02:29.219> two

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
number here this will now shift two

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.640 
number here this will now shift two
places<00:02:30.599> because<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.629> have<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.989> 100<00:02:32.530> so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
places because you have a 100 so

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.110 
places because you have a 100 so
multiply<00:02:33.040> Catherine<00:02:33.430> hand<00:02:33.639> there<00:02:33.879> are<00:02:33.969> two

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
multiply Catherine hand there are two

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.559 
multiply Catherine hand there are two
zeros<00:02:34.329> so<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.409> decimal<00:02:35.859> number<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.790> decimal

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
zeros so the decimal number the decimal

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.770 
zeros so the decimal number the decimal
point<00:02:38.379> hedge<00:02:38.620> oh<00:02:38.769> yeah<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.209> shift<00:02:40.480> now<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
point hedge oh yeah it will shift now to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.039 
point hedge oh yeah it will shift now to
two<00:02:41.379> digits<00:02:42.159> to<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.579> right<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.689> this<00:02:43.870> number

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
two digits to the right so this number

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.240 
two digits to the right so this number
will<00:02:44.349> become<00:02:44.469> something<00:02:44.889> like<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:46.919> six<00:02:47.919> seven

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
will become something like one six seven

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.869 
will become something like one six seven

dot-dot-dot<00:02:55.409> right<00:02:56.409> so<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.359> write<00:02:58.599> this

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
dot-dot-dot right so you can write this

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.280 
dot-dot-dot right so you can write this
as<00:02:59.049> 100<00:02:59.530> X<00:03:01.379> 100<00:03:02.379> x<00:03:02.859> equals<00:03:03.849> two<00:03:04.120> now<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.959> happy

malik they have one six six plus one

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.199 
malik they have one six six plus one
point<00:04:02.199> this<00:04:02.439> which<00:04:03.009> is<00:04:03.159> a<00:04:03.189> crappy<00:04:03.489> sadqa'<00:04:03.939> okay

point this which is a crappy sadqa' okay

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.479 
point this which is a crappy sadqa' okay
so<00:04:04.269> 166<00:04:05.079> plus<00:04:05.290> one<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.590> 167

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
so 166 plus one is 167

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.429 
so 166 plus one is 167
point<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.269> decimal<00:04:07.659> numbers<00:04:07.900> will<00:04:08.049> be<00:04:08.199> there

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
point the decimal numbers will be there

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.159 
point the decimal numbers will be there
which<00:04:09.159> is<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.400> same<00:04:09.639> as<00:04:09.939> I<00:04:10.599> have<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.840> select

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
which is the same as I have I select

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.379 
which is the same as I have I select
ahead<00:04:11.470> then<00:04:11.680> we<00:04:11.859> realize<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.759> this<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.959> our<00:04:14.470> X

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
ahead then we realize that this is our X

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:23.100 
ahead then we realize that this is our X
so<00:04:16.389> this<00:04:16.570> becomes<00:04:17.099> 1<00:04:18.099> 6<00:04:18.430> 2<00:04:18.609> 6<00:04:19.139> plus<00:04:20.139> X<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.930> this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
so this becomes 1 6 2 6 plus X so this

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.890 
so this becomes 1 6 2 6 plus X so this
implies<00:04:23.440> French<00:04:23.830> capital<00:04:24.460> u<00:04:24.789> 2x<00:04:25.510> are<00:04:25.750> you

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
implies French capital u 2x are you

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
implies French capital u 2x are you
going<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.289> go

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
going to go

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.100 
going to go
get<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.130> X<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.700> side<00:04:27.970> so<00:04:28.780> this<00:04:28.900> will

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
get the X to this side so this will

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.270 
get the X to this side so this will
become<00:04:29.260> 99<00:04:30.070> X<00:04:31.860> equal<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.040> one<00:04:33.670> six<00:04:34.360> six<00:04:35.280> which

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
become 99 X equal to one six six which

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.030 
become 99 X equal to one six six which
implies<00:04:36.720> X<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:38.230> equal<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.860> one<00:04:39.760> six<00:04:40.570> six

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
implies X is equal to one six six

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.230 
implies X is equal to one six six

know is the definition of a rational

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.490 
know is the definition of a rational
number<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:01.150> how<00:05:01.330> many<00:05:01.390> Recaros<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.230> bar

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
number so how many Recaros the is bar

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.930 
number so how many Recaros the is bar
how<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:04.030> were<00:05:04.300> given<00:05:04.690> actually<00:05:04.870> though

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
how we were given actually though

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.390 
how we were given actually though
decimal<00:05:06.940> though<00:05:07.840> digits<00:05:08.650> recurring<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
decimal though digits recurring in the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.460 
decimal though digits recurring in the
decimal<00:05:09.730> one<00:05:10.540> point<00:05:10.810> six<00:05:11.020> seven<00:05:11.170> six<00:05:11.380> seven

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
decimal one point six seven six seven

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.630 
decimal one point six seven six seven
six<00:05:11.800> seven<00:05:11.890> dot-dot-dot

six seven dot-dot-dot

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.160 
six seven dot-dot-dot
and<00:05:12.820> we<00:05:13.660> proved<00:05:14.050> how<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.810> decimal<00:05:16.810> number

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
and we proved how that a decimal number

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.190 
and we proved how that a decimal number
is<00:05:17.490> actually<00:05:18.490> a<00:05:18.540> rational<00:05:19.540> number<00:05:19.570> it's

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
is actually a rational number it's

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.680 
is actually a rational number it's
number<00:05:20.530> but<00:05:20.860> we<00:05:20.980> proved<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.730> this<00:05:22.450> number

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
number but we proved it that this number

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:30.530 
number but we proved it that this number
is<00:05:22.960> equal<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:24.660> one<00:05:25.660> six<00:05:26.140> six<00:05:26.520> by<00:05:27.520> nine<00:05:28.170> nine

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
is equal to one six six by nine nine

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.570 
is equal to one six six by nine nine
basically<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:32.170> of<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.470> form<00:05:32.710> P<00:05:32.860> by<00:05:33.040> Q<00:05:33.100> where

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
basically it is of the form P by Q where

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.670 
basically it is of the form P by Q where
P<00:05:33.610> and<00:05:33.910> Q<00:05:34.180> are<00:05:34.390> integers<00:05:34.510> and<00:05:35.050> Q<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.380> not<00:05:35.530> equal

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
P and Q are integers and Q is not equal

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.280 
P and Q are integers and Q is not equal
to<00:05:35.920> zero
