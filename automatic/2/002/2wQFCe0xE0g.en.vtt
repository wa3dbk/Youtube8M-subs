Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao answers Obama's with tai-chi 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
U.S. President Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Wen Jiabao) "President Obama and I just discussed the many ways we could work together."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
"This is one of my purposes for this visit to the U.S."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These two leaders complimented each other,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but they didn't speak about China's renminbi exchange rate reform.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
According to U.S. officials, however,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the two had an intense discussion behind closed doors.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Obama is said to have been aggressive about the renminbi exchange rate reform,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
otherwise the U.S. would have to find ways to defend itself.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But Wen found ways to avoid the subject. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
He remained calm and patient, as if practicing tai-chi.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
All he said was that China would continue to look into the exchange rate reform.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He urged the U.S. to not make this into a political matter.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He also said the high unemployment rate in the U.S. was not caused by the Chinese exchange rate.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Ever since the renminbi reform on July 21, 2005, 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
renminbi grew from 8.2765 to 1 dollar to the current rate of 6.7045 to 1.

0:01:37.000,0:00:43.000
U.S. Congress is about to make a proposal today.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
A tax on Chinese products may be imposed if China does not fix the exchange rate.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Wen Jiabao) "If we do accordingly to the wishes of certain members of the Congress to increase the rate from 20% to 40%,"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
"then many businesses in China may be forced to fold."

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It seems that both China and the U.S. are looking after each's own interests.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Many more discussions may be ahead.
