the<00:00:24.810> elements<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.769> probably<00:00:26.039> won't<00:00:26.189> be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the elements you probably won't be

the elements you probably won't be
surprised<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.880> these<00:00:27.090> things<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
surprised to know that these things can

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.700 
surprised to know that these things can
all<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.930> rotated<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> other

all be rotated so you can see the other
side<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.009> everything<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> probably

can't<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> actual<00:00:34.050> museum<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.579> go

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
can't do in the actual museum but we go

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.549 
can't do in the actual museum but we go
quite<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> bit<00:00:36.120> beyond<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> elements<00:00:37.260> was

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
quite a bit beyond what the elements was

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
quite a bit beyond what the elements was
able<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.579> example<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> take<00:00:39.149> one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
able to do for example if you take one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
able to do for example if you take one
of<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.649> only<00:00:40.800> rotate

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of these things you can not only rotate

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.720 
of these things you can not only rotate
it<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.270> also<00:00:42.420> pinch<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.079> bigger<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it you can also pinch it bigger and you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.279 
it you can also pinch it bigger and you
can<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.059> fantastic<00:00:45.719> detail<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:47.039> object

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
can see fantastic detail on this object

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
can see fantastic detail on this object
put<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> gap<00:00:49.559> again<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.280> photo<00:00:50.489> captions<00:00:51.030> are

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
put a gap again the photo captions are

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
put a gap again the photo captions are
now<00:00:51.809> two<00:00:52.379> sided<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now two sided so we see here a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680 
now two sided so we see here a
description<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> object<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.570> if

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
description of the object and then if

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
description of the object and then if
you<00:00:54.780> flip<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.050> you'll<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:56.239> more<00:00:57.239> technical

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you flip it you'll see more technical

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.920 
you flip it you'll see more technical
details<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> object<00:01:02.600> some<00:01:03.600> object

actually<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> sense<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
actually don't make a lot of sense to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.010 
actually don't make a lot of sense to
rotate<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.760> example<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.270> stamped<00:01:06.960> gold

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
rotate for example this stamped gold

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.830 
rotate for example this stamped gold
necklace<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:08.479> 2,500<00:01:09.479> years<00:01:09.570> old

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
necklace that's about 2,500 years old

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
necklace that's about 2,500 years old
wouldn't<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.830> sense<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> rotate<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
wouldn't really make sense to rotate it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
wouldn't really make sense to rotate it
so<00:01:11.640> instead<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.119> let<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> zoom<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:13.610> but

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so instead we just let you zoom it but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
so instead we just let you zoom it but
not<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.479> let<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> really

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
not just a little bit we let you really

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
not just a little bit we let you really
zoom<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.700> incredible<00:01:18.060> detail<00:01:18.570> at

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
zoom it you can see incredible detail at

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
zoom it you can see incredible detail at

one of my favorite features which is the
life<00:02:05.939> size<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.350> hold<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.680> down

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
life size but you hold this down

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.420 
life size but you hold this down
everything<00:02:08.970> suddenly<00:02:09.149> goes<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.810> its<00:02:09.959> actual

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
everything suddenly goes to its actual

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.800 
everything suddenly goes to its actual
physical<00:02:11.430> size<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
physical size which we can do because we

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.640 
physical size which we can do because we
know<00:02:12.930> exactly<00:02:13.200> how

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
know exactly how

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.470 
know exactly how
an<00:02:13.709> iPad<00:02:14.040> screen<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.180> know<00:02:15.209> exactly

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
an iPad screen is and we know exactly

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.479 
an iPad screen is and we know exactly
how<00:02:15.780> big<00:02:15.900> each<00:02:15.989> object<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:18.950> pick<00:02:19.950> amethyst

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
how big each object is pick amethyst

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.600 
how big each object is pick amethyst
here<00:02:21.439> so<00:02:22.439> again<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> whole<00:02:23.250> bunch<00:02:23.400> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
here so again we have a whole bunch of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
here so again we have a whole bunch of
beautiful<00:02:24.209> things<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> rotate<00:02:25.019> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
beautiful things you can rotate this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470 
beautiful things you can rotate this
particular<00:02:26.220> crystal<00:02:26.579> in<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.909> corner<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.390> is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
particular crystal in the corner here is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
particular crystal in the corner here is
quite<00:02:28.230> large<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:28.620> life-size<00:02:29.280> button<00:02:29.610> does

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
quite large so life-size button does

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.170 
quite large so life-size button does
something<00:02:30.180> fairly<00:02:30.780> dramatic<00:02:31.319> here<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.180> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
something fairly dramatic here but this

isn't just a book of pretty objects we

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.789 
isn't just a book of pretty objects we
look<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.930> text<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.349> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> corner<00:02:37.769> here

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
look at the text up in the corner here

if<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.099> texture<00:02:38.400> you'll<00:02:38.579> see<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.819> expands

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
if you texture you'll see this expands

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.050 
if you texture you'll see this expands
out<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.689> be<00:02:39.840> quite<00:02:40.799> an<00:02:41.040> in-depth<00:02:41.430> discussion

now<00:06:10.300> let's<00:06:10.509> look<00:06:10.629> at<00:06:10.779> the<00:06:10.900> complete

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
now let's look at the complete

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.260 
now let's look at the complete
categorization<00:06:11.830> if<00:06:12.490> we<00:06:12.610> go<00:06:12.759> up<00:06:12.969> to<00:06:13.120> the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
categorization if we go up to the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.779 
categorization if we go up to the
inorganic<00:06:13.569> category<00:06:14.349> here<00:06:14.830> we'll<00:06:15.550> see<00:06:15.669> that

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
inorganic category here we'll see that

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.179 
inorganic category here we'll see that
there's<00:06:15.969> actually<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.719> lot<00:06:17.080> more<00:06:17.379> to<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:17.979> than

just these few popular damn types that

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.890 
just these few popular damn types that
are<00:06:21.550> showcased<00:06:22.029> on<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.330> homepage<00:06:22.509> for

North<00:06:32.860> aight<00:06:33.099> feldspar<00:06:34.259> we<00:06:35.259> see<00:06:35.439> there's

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
North aight feldspar we see there's

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.980 
North aight feldspar we see there's
three<00:06:35.979> subcategories<00:06:36.339> of<00:06:36.729> that<00:06:36.879> my<00:06:37.599> favorite
