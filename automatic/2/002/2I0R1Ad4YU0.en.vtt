00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.610
 and it 's quick to regulate valves 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.210
 Queen 19 1.6 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.190
 c 2 l engine as they say first 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 we remove the replacement valve cover 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 from the little boy who goes upstairs he saw the booth 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.940
 spark plug the number 1 to the outside you put a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.280
 screwdriver in the place of the spark plug 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.290
 then with him with a bar where 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.420
 transition something you're moving through 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.550
 the teeth of the crown so that it goes 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.680
 raising the piston when the piston is 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.320
 above all that is the maximum point 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.580
 higher you will realize because the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.870
 screwdriver is going to mark you 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.970
 go up goes up goes up until in a 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.260
 point of going down again there comes back two 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.610
 tooth back and it's the maximum point 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.730
 higher 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.490
 then you grab a probe of that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.130
 practical and useful and you notice that the 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.800
 intake valves have to have 0 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.840
 15 and the escape 0 20 we go with the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.660
 practical example was some would be of 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.610
 escape that this would be of admission the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.290
 third would be admission the fourth would be 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.160
 escape then we have the eighth escape the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.450
 seventh issue the sixth admission and the 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.110
 fifth escape again then 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 escape we said there must be 0 20 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 we put the probe 0 20 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 the metal quoted from 0 20 in back justito 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 justito means that this one is in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.540
 light too and it is already 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.970
 regular and 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 here we have the escape the one that has 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.850
 that being 0 15 the probe of 0 15 enters 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.480
 justito justito perfect in the case of 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.740
 that we had to regulate the valve 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.490
 10 key in hand will have loosen the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 nut that I hope you see clearly 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 it gets stuck 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 with a pincer the francesita or a 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.770
 tool that enters properly 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.520
 square between quotes that has 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.410
 above the whole valve then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.630
 turning this little square turns it around 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.960
 to the left opens the light of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.090
 valve and you are probing once it passes 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.600
 well the waves for example in this case 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.520
 in 0 15 0 enters the well 29 and 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.230
 the dance of 10 you have the right light 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.090
 there no more tight or do you leave locked 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.770
 the little tip of this square you leave it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.440
 locked with the tool and tighten the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.870
 nut of 10 you already have the light and good you go 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.360
 doing everything in the order that 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.450
 corresponds if it suits you to sue yourself 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.570
 a check with precision 50 pesos for the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.570
 application
