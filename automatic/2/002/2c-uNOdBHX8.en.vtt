00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.910
 I want to tell one story it was 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.750
 in the winter of 2007, the month I donâ€™t remember exactly 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.879
 rode from Buynaksk Makhachkala while in 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.820
 fixed-route taxi and recruited passengers 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.379

 it's time for evening prayer 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.390

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.519
 time of evening prayer I will pass 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.320
 asked the driver when they approached

 little mosques dressing between 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.379
 Makhachkala and Buynaksk stop on 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.000
 a few minutes to do namaz 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.989
 the driver said that if the passengers are not 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.930
 objected saying he do not mind as soon as he 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.750
 it said the passengers started making noise 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.030
 late for urgent business although there is no 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.490
 there were no Orthodox all were 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.090

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.250
 older ladies they did not stop 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.000
 statement who are in a hurry and even become 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.490
 resent 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.380
 began to slander the Muslims who 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.549
 pray and sin 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.240
 the usual set of atheists and breaking above and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.090
 The most interesting 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.799
 not even a weak voice in my 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.539
 defense 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.119
 when i told the driver to make him 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.640
 stopped the car for me namaz more expensive than 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.460
 all that in this world he is happy 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.189

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.189
 As they say a woman with a horse mare is easier 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.810
 dropping me frosty dark 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.229
 minibus victoriously quickly disappeared from 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 mind and went to the mosque prayed 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.130
 stepped on the roads and began to vote fa la 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.950
 la 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.009
 although it was already dark 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.260
 long did not have to wait sat down on a ride and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.739
 when they began to climb the pass 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.200
 We saw an accident ahead 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.870
 yes this is the same minibus i 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 asked the driver to stop 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.010
 people scattered everywhere and many wounded 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.920
 two women killed to death 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 these were the women who most 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.280
 indignant who believed that all the troubles 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.130
 from Islam the supreme bark had to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.860
 wait around for a few minutes I already 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.010
 I hear voices that say it all 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.530
 pure chance can be a how 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.810
 explain what exactly these women are 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.769
 slandered Islam found there your 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.319
 the end is such a short life we 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.049
 sometimes we are in a hurry without even finding the time 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.500
 pray and do not know where we lead 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.500
 this rush
