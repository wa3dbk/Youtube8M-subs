00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.050
 yes i thought we were 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.050
 and I found that incomprehensible 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.559
 very bad very very anxious about the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.230
 competition started 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:21.920
 I think the miller had all 38 balls 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.210
 Shot because we are constantly 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.740
 did not dare to play according to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.539
 me thereby two attackers with whom we are 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.360
 start 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.620
 yes when there are four men withheld 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.780
 It seems to me that you are people somewhere 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.730
 but you don't have it 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.730
 dare to play fruit 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.620
 yes then it becomes very difficult and that 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.420
 it was too 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.790
 Heerenveen was biting I thought she was correct 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.100
 nothing was very dangerous though 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.740
 we would prevail in the competition 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.810
 After half an hour it easy we 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.160
 went to play better football 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 we actually get a good side too 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.020
 of chess 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.420
 yes second evening image second half 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.699
 heerenveen the better two big chances 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.049
 already one in earlier in the second 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.820
 half 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.680
 you might have hoped that eventually 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 moment was not deserved 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 I think the defeat has been earned 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.250
 everyone was the better was the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 more aggressive has had the best chances 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.150
 for a year the disappointment has been that we 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.150
 have not been ourselves and that 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.300
 and maybe that is possible I know 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.980
 not but I think you always dare 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.760
 have the courage to play forward and that 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.020
 we didn't have that today then yes 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.800
 must also 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.210
 after all, we must replace then and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.950
 if you are then put under pressure then 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 Do you already have a speed? 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.320
 little length for 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.580
 to get the connection again we 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.670
 have not played well and deserve 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.450
 I think I lost that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 can better describe 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 thanks also an analysis 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.380
 marco van basts 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.060
 yes good reina 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.650
 my whims agree with it already 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 I said we were in the first half 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.930
 an equal competition to people 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 that the team were in balance 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.440
 it was just what feyenoord d with 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 after all that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.650
 for playing in and are not really 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.450
 collapse 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 so played together three striker must 2 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 In the end we have little 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.040
 try to change and get busy quickly 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.240
 trying to indicate that it worked 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.250
 and that did not result in an op 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.110
 office but ultimately in one in one 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.440
 0 0 and in the second as we think 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 I 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.520
 the game that can attract lovers 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.900
 it also became some simple feyenoord 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.690
 actually played in a kind of fourth 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.550
 information is a like we did it 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.050
 actually wanted it and yes it was 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.300
 a competition that could go either way 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.730
 and this time it fell happy 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.580
 a good side to ours 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.010
 and yes in the second exit you do that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.290
 feyenoord with a long ball here and there 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.000
 it made it difficult for us and especially 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.100
 in switching with with chess that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.550
 highway is a constant danger 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.040
 danger eventually we had it 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 also with you 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.450
 go nasi and with our friend filip and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.280
 alfred and yes that always turns out 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.629
 to be a dangerous people and also 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 this time they are again tonight 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.670
 has been decisive and that has 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.519
 in the end it was the difference 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.799
 after 90 minutes well it is for us 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.209
 at least a good win 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.870
 I think we have a good team 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.269
 performed 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.189
 I was a bit more relaxed after the game 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.569
 see if i was going to get some rest 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.540
 the match and past matches 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.220
 so yes that gives that gives one 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.389
 good feeling I have to say 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.150
 And we are we will do a trick extremely 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.989
 satisfied that we are from a title candidate 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.989
 have been able to win
