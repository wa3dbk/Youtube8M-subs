book yet I think Ben this has a very

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.680 
book yet I think Ben this has a very
pedestrian<00:04:22.950> understanding<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.690> time

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
pedestrian understanding of time

traveling and the effects and
consequences<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.830> has<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
consequences that it has on the

consequences that it has on the
space-time<00:04:31.540> continuum<00:04:33.480> out<00:04:34.480> it's<00:04:34.720> just<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
space-time continuum out it's just I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.980 
space-time continuum out it's just I
guess<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:35.920> hypothetical<00:04:36.100> situation<00:04:37.030> if<00:04:37.660> the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
guess it's hypothetical situation if the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.780 
guess it's hypothetical situation if the
x-men<00:04:38.350> were<00:04:38.530> transported<00:04:39.220> in<00:04:39.370> here<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
x-men were transported in here in the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.150 
x-men were transported in here in the
future<00:04:40.120> what<00:04:40.300> would<00:04:40.420> they<00:04:40.600> react<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.380> things

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
future what would they react and things

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.950 
future what would they react and things
are<00:04:42.310> gonna<00:04:42.430> change<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.330> I'm<00:04:43.510> pretty<00:04:43.750> sure

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
are gonna change and I'm pretty sure

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.810 
are gonna change and I'm pretty sure
there's<00:04:44.260> gonna<00:04:44.320> be<00:04:44.530> sent<00:04:44.770> back<00:04:45.010> obviously

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
there's gonna be sent back obviously

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.400 
there's gonna be sent back obviously
into<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.300> past<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.870> have<00:04:47.020> their<00:04:47.200> memories

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.900 
line I'm not a big fan of Bendis the
only<00:05:11.290> reason<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.590> think<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:11.980> comic<00:05:12.580> book<00:05:12.730> up

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
only reason I think this comic book up

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.530 
only reason I think this comic book up
was<00:05:13.120> because<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:13.900> mr.<00:05:14.440> eminence<00:05:15.100> artwork<00:05:15.820> so

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
was because of mr. eminence artwork so

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.860 
was because of mr. eminence artwork so
we'll<00:05:16.690> see<00:05:17.430> anyway<00:05:18.570> talking<00:05:19.570> about<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
we'll see anyway talking about the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.890 
we'll see anyway talking about the
figures<00:05:20.200> there's<00:05:20.470> really<00:05:20.590> nothing<00:05:21.040> that

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
figures there's really nothing that

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.380 
figures there's really nothing that
special<00:05:22.900> except<00:05:23.230> for<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:24.120> repaints<00:05:25.120> of<00:05:25.270> the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
special except for the repaints of the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.110 
special except for the repaints of the
of<00:05:25.600> these<00:05:25.840> figures<00:05:26.260> again<00:05:27.250> if<00:05:27.790> you're<00:05:27.970> not<00:05:28.060> a
