 culture is a reason for worship

 the eastern nation has for decades built a reputation for 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.189
 country geek par excellence and although it is a place of pilgrimage 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 forced for the fans to the sector the distance the language and especially the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.680
 travel price back many, so it's always going to be more 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.869
 cheap and easy to approach the exhibitions that are made in europe 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 honoring Japanese leisure 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.890
 The last and most important to be celebrated in the peninsula has been the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.230
 yapa very well in Barcelona during an intense weekend the passionate 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.550
 anime and video games have had the opportunity to see an appetizer of 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.380
 Japan in Catalan lands 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.220
 Once inside the Palau San Jordi facilities, it was not necessary to be 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.890
 detective to find the event the disguised people betrayed many 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.630
 of the assistants as fanatics delivered to their passions during some 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.850
 hours 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.189
 and there they go very well is considered as an intense concentration of events 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.070
 where everything related to the electronic entertainment sector and comics 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.180
 they have their hole 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.530
 We were able to attend both an introductory Japanese class 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.229
 like a classic pro evolution soccer tournament, all of it summing up in a wide 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.350
 space comics stores imported merchandaising figures and although 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.750
 it implies oddities of video games for its use and enjoyment by all 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.670
 assistants p 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 the defendant's lawyer rented for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.980
 new laredo - an event not the war of the questioners once of the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.060
 dialogue and debate 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.400
 this claim that we take 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.080
 the pm from Monday to Friday of work goes through what truly transforming 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.140
 the vendÃ©e globe another afternoon 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.200
 if from a stage of 300 square meters animators of dances and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 fashion shows happened to a hearing delivered 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.350
 while a few meters

 the fighting explained yesterday four alternated with wrestling displays 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.730
 free live and direct but without doubt the biggest attraction of the fair in 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.869
 some of your visits 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.620
 efe that arrived disguised and willing to give free rein to their 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.739
 hobbies with costumes that have cost them weeks of work now well 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.590
 in this way very much to be able to bring you the true spirit here and I believe 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 that also every two hours at oslo a little higher 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.540
 it depends on the communion with their video games 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.479
 the detainees who have been studying in detail 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.479
 videogames I love days 2 and 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.899
 since the middle of the month 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:43.559
 the video game characters win by absolute majority and the resemblance of 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.340
 some of them physiologically amazing 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.889
 although many seemed willing to scandalize it as it was 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.959
 some Japanese were also allowed to see that maybe because of the genocide of 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.829

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:00.730
 in those of barcelona 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.629
 then it looks like it looks afp like tokio now well 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.830
 in the end the most important thing is the opinion of the day people could see from 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.019
 near some of those extravagances that seemed to be thousands of kilometers 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.809
 away 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.789
 either of the two coaches are there and there except the human 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.109
 Some of the 40 years old was now watered 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 the yellow that saved him 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.019
 you already know if you do not get the pasta for a trip to japan within a year 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.819
 you have a date where you can feel the crowd and the dynasties flood the 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.299
 streets here will dig a Kenyan embassy but enthusiastic 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.549
