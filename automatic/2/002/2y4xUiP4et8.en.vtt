00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.450
 the yield at dolphin underflying 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.220
 Dolphin Fahrwerk no idea how to 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.810
 she pronounces 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 we would have set the rocket once 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.730
 fireball by palo queen is a rocket 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 his rocket set with many 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.559
 various rocket effects stand 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.629
 unfortunately not on it the whole set 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:01:00.410
 However, it is huge with 331 grams 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:03.410
 again to the proof tf2 denim the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:12.850
 big rockets somewhere in the things 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:15.170
 stands on it somewhere stood here the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:22.670
 small if you can read it 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.100
 11.9 turn slightly bigger if you have it 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.100
 can read 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 27 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.780
 he does not know 27 has the big ones 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.710
 would have to have 30 to 40 grams had me 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 said totally again 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 Oversized sleeves like ours 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.090
 aldi or lidl 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.689
 what should one infect and gave it 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.569
 for free never used something like this 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.179
 Let's see if something is good and then 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:08.289
 we have two times the loud inc lear 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.989
 shockwave and indeed it is this loaded 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.260
 battery from the volcano at that time 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.530
 before was shot with these extremes 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 so that then put us so unfortunately yes 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.470
 not once came but another 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:32.410
 cache that is now supposedly the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:37.510
 original with 36 shot of 198 grams 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.519
 that's what I've met, I think 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.690
 do not remember 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.530
 55 the advance approximately also has 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.530
 again as proof 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.950
 tf2 I am really curious if it is the 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.980
 right is he told me it would be 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.389
 the battery 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.180
 I think he has the right one 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:08.590
 label effect is unfortunately nowhere 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:11.760
 I let myself be surprised 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.190
 I hope it's the right one and as well 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.310
 There was not much free article there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.500
 but at least three times dolphin 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.370
 Fulcrum ballpoint pens get a lot 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.180
 nice questions always helps you remember 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.180
 Something always jumps out 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.010
 b 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.010
