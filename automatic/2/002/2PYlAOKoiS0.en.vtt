artwork now this artwork is very cartoon

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.740 
artwork now this artwork is very cartoon
like<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.219> does<00:01:13.399> not<00:01:13.579> look<00:01:13.850> realistic<00:01:14.479> at<00:01:14.600> all

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
like it does not look realistic at all

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.080 
like it does not look realistic at all
and<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.680> lot<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.920> people<00:01:16.459> when<00:01:16.729> they<00:01:16.759> first

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and a lot of people when they first

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.620 
and a lot of people when they first
start<00:01:17.270> digitizing<00:01:18.229> will<00:01:19.209> just<00:01:20.209> do<00:01:20.359> something

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
start digitizing will just do something

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.029 
start digitizing will just do something
like<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.289> with<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.310> leaves<00:01:23.889> they'll<00:01:24.889> do<00:01:25.009> a

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
like this with the leaves they'll do a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.559 
like this with the leaves they'll do a
petal<00:01:25.459> that<00:01:25.579> looks<00:01:25.789> like<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.479> then

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
petal that looks like that and then

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.569 
petal that looks like that and then
they'll<00:01:27.079> come<00:01:27.259> down<00:01:27.439> here<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:28.009> they'll<00:01:28.429> do<00:01:28.549> a

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
they'll come down here and they'll do a

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.599 
they'll come down here and they'll do a
petal<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.209> looks<00:01:29.420> like<00:01:29.569> this<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.609> it's

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
petal that looks like this and it's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.660 
petal that looks like this and it's
gonna<00:01:31.789> be<00:01:31.999> a<00:01:32.029> very<00:01:32.920> unrealistic<00:01:33.920> flat

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
gonna be a very unrealistic flat

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.139 
gonna be a very unrealistic flat
cartoony<00:01:35.450> type<00:01:35.719> image<00:01:36.579> now<00:01:37.579> on<00:01:37.729> screen<00:01:37.909> it

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
cartoony type image now on screen it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.969 
cartoony type image now on screen it
almost<00:01:38.479> looks<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.990> bit<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.409> mess<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:39.649> if

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
almost looks like a bit of a mess but if

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.089 
almost looks like a bit of a mess but if
I<00:01:40.069> get<00:01:40.279> rid<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.549> my<00:01:40.779> my<00:01:41.779> stitches<00:01:42.319> you<00:01:42.740> can<00:01:42.889> see

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.569 
I get rid of my my stitches you can see
how<00:01:43.249> random<00:01:43.819> everything<00:01:44.299> looks<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:45.679> screen<00:01:46.069> we

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
how random everything looks on screen we

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.489 
how random everything looks on screen we
have<00:01:46.700> about<00:01:46.880> four<00:01:47.179> thousand<00:01:47.749> five<00:01:48.079> hundred

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
have about four thousand five hundred

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.919 
have about four thousand five hundred
and<00:01:48.619> eleven<00:01:48.679> stitches<00:01:49.189> in<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.520> design<00:01:49.969> but

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
and eleven stitches in that design but

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.779 
and eleven stitches in that design but
when<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.200> put<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.679> true<00:01:51.950> view<00:01:52.219> you<00:01:52.639> can

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
when we put that to true view you can

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.589 
when we put that to true view you can
see<00:01:52.999> how<00:01:53.149> it's<00:01:53.329> starting<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.719> come<00:01:53.869> alive<00:01:54.139> the

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
see how it's starting to come alive the

palm trees are probably one of my

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.639 
palm trees are probably one of my
favorite<00:01:58.369> designs<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.999> do<00:01:59.179> by<00:01:59.869> using<00:02:00.469> those

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
favorite designs to do by using those

long<00:02:01.099> running<00:02:01.609> stitches<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.389> took<00:02:02.599> a<00:02:02.659> piece<00:02:03.079> of

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
long running stitches we took a piece of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.559 
long running stitches we took a piece of
artwork<00:02:03.529> that<00:02:03.829> does<00:02:04.069> look<00:02:04.249> very<00:02:04.329> cartoony<00:02:05.329> and

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
artwork that does look very cartoony and

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
if you look at the embroidered

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.940 
if you look at the embroidered
representation<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.660> actually<00:02:09.440> has<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> lot<00:02:09.920> of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
representation it actually has a lot of

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
representation it actually has a lot of
life<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.580> dimension<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.239> it

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
life and dimension to it

this<00:02:12.470> effect<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.010> beautiful<00:02:13.550> whenever<00:02:13.880> you're

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this effect is beautiful whenever you're

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030 
this effect is beautiful whenever you're
doing<00:02:14.450> anything<00:02:14.750> that's<00:02:14.989> very<00:02:15.260> leafy<00:02:15.590> or

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
doing anything that's very leafy or

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.400 
doing anything that's very leafy or
grass<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.750> blended<00:02:18.170> two

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
grass like and we just blended two

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.770 
grass like and we just blended two
colors<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> lighter<00:02:19.790> green<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.420> darker

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
colors a lighter green and a darker

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.490 
colors a lighter green and a darker
green<00:02:20.960> together<00:02:21.380> when<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.250> got<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
green together when we got to the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.470 
green together when we got to the
of<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> tree<00:02:24.130> we<00:02:24.400> added<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.790> couple<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.180> shades

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
of the tree we added a couple of shades

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.320 
of the tree we added a couple of shades
of<00:02:25.690> brown<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.580> probably<00:02:27.820> one<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
of brown and this is probably one of the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.930 
of brown and this is probably one of the
easiest<00:02:28.810> techniques<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.500> do<00:02:29.710> because<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.700> saw

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
easiest techniques to do because you saw

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.030 
easiest techniques to do because you saw
how<00:02:31.120> random<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:31.900> quick<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.440> was<00:02:32.650> doing<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
how random and how quick I was doing it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
how random and how quick I was doing it
when<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.220> were<00:02:33.400> digitizing<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:34.150> screen

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
