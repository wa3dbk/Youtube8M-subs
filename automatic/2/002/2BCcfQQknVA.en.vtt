 inches and let's make bacon tacos 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.860
 with lettuce let's prepare our 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.110
 amador two batches of coal one in the 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.029
 fireplace and one inside our lover 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.350
 at the base of the smoker we have to 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.210
 get to the middle 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.320
 I put on my gloves because it's 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.260
 let's put water in the deposit 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.140
 our smoker so that it does not raise the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.030
 temperature more than we need 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.980
 taking care that they do not fall 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.780
 shores to not turn off our coal 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.670
