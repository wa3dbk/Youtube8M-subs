the world I wanted to I wanted to create

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.040 
the world I wanted to I wanted to create
a<00:03:47.790> world<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.150> was<00:03:48.330> big<00:03:48.480> enough<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.720> many

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
a world that was big enough for many

a world that was big enough for many
stories<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.860> was<00:03:49.980> always<00:03:50.130> very<00:03:50.370> frustrating

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060

to<00:03:51.180> me<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:52.140> read<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.800> book<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:55.040> really<00:03:56.040> fall<00:03:56.220> in

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
to me to read a book and really fall in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.500 
to me to read a book and really fall in
love<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.850> fall<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.180> love<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.330> the

love with it you fall in love with the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.820 
love with it you fall in love with the
characters<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.410> seems<00:03:58.590> like<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
characters and then it seems like the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.670 
characters and then it seems like the
author<00:03:58.980> gets<00:03:59.250> bored<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.820> just<00:03:59.910> wanders<00:04:00.510> away

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
author gets bored and just wanders away

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.800

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
but you want to live there for a while

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.810 
but you want to live there for a while
longer<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.800> some<00:04:05.160> authors<00:04:05.520> paint

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
longer I think some authors paint

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.090 
longer I think some authors paint
themselves<00:04:06.000> into<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.480> corner<00:04:06.890> because<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
themselves into a corner because of the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.840 
themselves into a corner because of the
nature<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.580> stories<00:04:08.970> they<00:04:09.150> tell<00:04:10.610> where<00:04:11.610> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
nature the stories they tell where the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.570 
nature the stories they tell where the
world<00:04:12.030> doesn't<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.540> exist<00:04:12.780> except

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
world doesn't really exist except

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.300 
world doesn't really exist except
instead<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.700> like<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> movie<00:04:15.240> set<00:04:15.660> where<00:04:16.310> like

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
instead of like a movie set where like

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.949 
instead of like a movie set where like
the<00:04:17.459> action<00:04:17.880> takes<00:04:18.120> place<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.630> looks<00:04:18.750> very

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the action takes place and it looks very

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.380 
the action takes place and it looks very
realistic<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.799> story<00:04:20.130> but<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.209> turn

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
realistic in the story but if you turn

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.940 
realistic in the story but if you turn
left<00:04:21.630> instead<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.140> right<00:04:22.260> suddenly<00:04:22.830> you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
left instead of right suddenly you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.890 
left instead of right suddenly you
realize<00:04:23.250> it's<00:04:23.460> just<00:04:23.520> plywood<00:04:24.030> with<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.510> coat<00:04:24.870> of

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
realize it's just plywood with a coat of

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.020 
realize it's just plywood with a coat of
paint<00:04:25.169> over<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.650> front<00:04:25.919> I've<00:04:26.460> really<00:04:26.910> built
