00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:30.260
 hello franz grad four chords switch 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:34.960
 but like when we switch from today 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.670
 we want to make one of our own 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.660
 we have to become independent from the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.110
 left hand and calculates the best order 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.690
 practicing chords is the right hand 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.580
 just pull a rhythm through it 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.460
 Now I just put the hand on 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.760
 the side of jew who is in so 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.760
 mute 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:19.789
 the little robbing the chords plays 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:22.460
 Paul Simon and he as a guitarist I have to 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.180
 always pick up the hand when I am to 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.930
 will change next accord 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.880
 As a guitarist, I always have the hand 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.229
 pick up the next accord 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.560
 mature wants to raise his hand around the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:45.640
 access next accord 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.640
 That's why I always play empty-time 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 So I'm playing a god 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.840
 Of course , sometimes the position to cdu 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.789
 I too my position too much 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 namely looking for my position to the eu 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.509
 in the end I play between 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.170
 every chord between each chord 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170
 switch 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.110
 so now let's try that again 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.110
 that is, direct attracts by simply 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 I do it very slowly 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.920
 as well as a start the game would 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.780
 eyes 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.760
 4 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.050
 easy mistake its beginning on the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:14.530
 is guitar making at macro table play 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:21.220
 clogged it played off if that means 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.370
 that's why they were still with me through and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.370
 now 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.640
 it will be a great deal to pick it up 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.270
 Fast heating does not think that's good 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.110
 sound good while adding this 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.050
 lesson 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.100

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.140
