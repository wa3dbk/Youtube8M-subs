00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.299

 crusaders marx found out that sophie is 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.360
 he had moved and had not told him anything 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.360
 that's why he did not dare to leave stefani 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.040
 what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 and she decided that tonight she would go to the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.380
 party still without invitation 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.080
 Y 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 it was 8 o'clock at night, the long-awaited 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.540
 party was an hour and a half 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.690
 start when sophie gave him the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.059
 last touches to his disguise was not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.790
 nothing flashy a dress style 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.960
 medieval since if she was a big fan 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.960
 from that historical era 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.560
 a few minutes later álex arrived at the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 your cousin's department with a friend and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 came in with the copy of keys that she 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.960
 I had given 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.910
 the girls were happy and not 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.950
 they stopped talking about their costumes and 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.690
 the expectations they had for the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.550
 night 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.560
 álex asked danny to wait in the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.560
 room and went looking for sophie 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.369
 to find he warned that marks 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 I had gone to look for her this afternoon 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.080
 home and told him how he had reacted 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.320
 when he told her that she no longer lived there 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 Sophie felt something silly had not 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.630
 mentioned nothing to his former neighbor trust 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 in which joey would do it and since there was 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 happened the furniture incident did not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.780
 had imagined that maybe he did not 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.850
 I had heard of the move 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.040
 he told his cousin not to worry 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.680
 who would then talk to Marc who 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.629
 I would solve the problem 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.239
 Marc had been shown in several 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.670
 occasions what I felt for her about 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.310
 all with the fight a week ago and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.069
 Sophie wanted to stop pretending not to 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.709
 I was in love with him friendship with 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.159
 Jennifer was no longer an obstacle between 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.159
 they 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.850
 brand had just put on the disguise of 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.800
 vampire when i go went into his 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.750
 room to ask him how he 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.230
 felt 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.320
 his friend hesitated a moment but then 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.710
 he confessed that he was still down 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.290
 happened that same afternoon 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.940
 I'll try to encourage him by counting in the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.670
 disguises that some unknown 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.520
 would take but then the call to the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.920
 door was interrupted by the first 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.530
 guests had arrived 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.700
 sophie álex and danny entered the building 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.380
 one hour after the party will begin 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.110
 the apartment door had no 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.020
 key so anyone could 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.360
 pass without any problems 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.720
 that gave him a little distrust of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.660
 sophie that had that jennifer show up 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.080
 when entering the three will look for national huí 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.960
 To congratulate him, the four of them spoke 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.820
 and Alex presented her to her friend with 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.150
 which I fled was fascinated by 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.400
 instantly he asked her about her suit and 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.030
 soon they chatted with a lot 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.640
 excitement apparently alex did not exaggerate 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.910
 when he said that his friend was going to 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.910
 love 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.690
 Sufi told her cousin that she would look 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.700
 love to talk and left her alone so 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.840
 she began to go around looking for 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.319
 new friendships 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.820
 at that moment I regret not having worn 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.700
 a second reserve friend 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.550
 her cousin meanwhile headed 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.460
 straight to the kitchen where he joe and told 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.250
 who was his neighbor found him 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.880
 talking to some friends but so soon 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.430
 as they saw her, they left the room 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.800
 although his end did not know them he had the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.270
 impression that they had good in 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.270
 clear who was she 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.680
 marc was upset with partner but at 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.740
 see her I could not help thinking that she looked 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.260
 beautiful with that disguise and almost without 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.260
 noticing he threw a smile 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.500
 Sophie started by apologizing for not 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.320
 tell him about the move and he repeated 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.129
 everything Alex had explained 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.279
 hours ago 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.459
 in he understood but he still felt 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.459
 annoying 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.580
 suddenly she came closer she did not want 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.520
 contain more what I felt for him and 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.780
 I was willing to tell you everything in that 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.389
 same moment 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.130
 the door opened and a guest to 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:36.410
 nothing desired entered was stefan and crossed the 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.889
 door and instantly realized 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.130
 that did not fit with the rest I did not have 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.450
 idea that the costume party and that 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.030
 He put her in a very bad mood 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.730
 enraged I look for marc did not take long 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.000
 in seeing it from a distance and I notice that the 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.170
 talk with sophie was not the type that 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.680
 I would keep a friend with her anger 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.990
 increased more and more at that time 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.560
 understood why she had not been invited 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.130
 to the party it seemed quite evident 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.410
 that marc cheated on her and that's why 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.800
 had presented as his girlfriend in front of 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.800
 no one 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.630
 Sofia was about to pronounce the 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.910
 keywords that would change the course 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.300
 of things between the two when 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.700
 stephanie stepped in 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.280
 Concealing his anger greeted her and 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.520
 then to his partner to whom he said something 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.520
 brief 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.900
 at that precise moment sophie contained 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.930
 the breath 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:52.230
 and he listened as Stephanie was told 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:56.630
 love to mars 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.180
 whole collapsed in front of his eyes 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.340
 he addressed both he asked them to 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.340
 they will excuse and left 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.980
 sea that saw her leave the department without 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.780
 know how to act everything was perfect 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.260
 until the moment stephanie 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.110
 he appeared and he felt miserable 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.910
 I had noticed on Sophia's face that 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.190
 those words caused him a deep 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.230
 pain 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.590
 I put aside the girl with whom I left 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.560
 and he set out to find sofia but 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.440
 stephanie called letting out all his 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.510
 fury and told her that if she went back she would not 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.820
 I would see her again 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:44.630
 Marc detested her for getting in 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:48.970
 between the sofa so he threw a 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.970
 hateful look and left the place 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.340
 under the stairs he went out into the street and 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.590
 I look for both sides 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.590
 Sophie was not like that anymore
