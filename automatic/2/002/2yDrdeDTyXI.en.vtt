students and I think probably until

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.220

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
don't fully appreciate what a big deal

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.850 
don't fully appreciate what a big deal
it<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.600> because<00:01:33.200> they<00:01:33.320> don't<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:33.560> anything

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
it is because they don't have anything

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.490 
it is because they don't have anything
to<00:01:34.130> compare<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.550> to<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.690> all<00:01:35.840> about<00:01:35.870> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
to compare it to this is all about the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.260
