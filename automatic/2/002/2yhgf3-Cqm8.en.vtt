00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
by weaving Helens name in cord we're

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.699 
by weaving Helens name in cord we're
going<00:00:10.799> to<00:00:10.860> jump<00:00:11.160> directly<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.879> a<00:00:12.119> weave<00:00:12.389> that's

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
going to jump directly to a weave that's

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.959 
going to jump directly to a weave that's
almost<00:00:13.709> finished<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.369> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.610> will<00:00:14.760> just

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
almost finished now and I will just

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.390 
almost finished now and I will just

finish it off it's sat on my clemens
lathe<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.170> suggest<00:00:19.289> any<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
lathe and I would suggest any of the

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.890 
lathe and I would suggest any of the
proprietary<00:00:20.670> brands<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.210> rod<00:00:21.359> lathe<00:00:21.630> are

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
proprietary brands of rod lathe are

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.460 
proprietary brands of rod lathe are
required<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.039> weaving<00:00:23.550> effectively<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
required to do weaving effectively the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
required to do weaving effectively the
pattern<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.310> isn't<00:00:26.699> george's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
pattern we're doing isn't george's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.560

cross'<00:00:27.679> it<00:00:28.789> consists<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> two<00:00:30.179> layers<00:00:30.419> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
cross' it consists of two layers of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.479 
cross' it consists of two layers of
thread<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.430> each<00:00:32.430> layer<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.030> 25<00:00:33.780> threads<00:00:34.489> so

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
thread and each layer is 25 threads so

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
thread and each layer is 25 threads so
it's<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> 50<00:00:36.030> thread<00:00:36.270> pattern<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.379> I'm<00:00:37.500> using

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it's a 50 thread pattern and I'm using

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
it's a 50 thread pattern and I'm using
it<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.039> black<00:00:38.370> background<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:40.789> I'm<00:00:41.789> trying

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it on a black background so I'm trying

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
it on a black background so I'm trying
to<00:00:42.239> finish<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> upright<00:00:43.160> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.059> red<00:00:46.039> that's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to finish the upright on the red that's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.790 
to finish the upright on the red that's
my<00:00:47.219> final<00:00:47.520> turn<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> upright<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.620> the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
diameter of this a thread so we're

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.390 
diameter of this a thread so we're
getting<00:02:01.540> now<00:02:01.750> near<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> end<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.470> transferring

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400

getting now near the end of transferring
our<00:02:04.270> red<00:02:04.480> threads<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.960> right

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390 

okay<00:02:53.390> that's<00:02:53.630> my<00:02:53.810> counts<00:02:54.320> done<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.250> I'll

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
okay that's my counts done and I'll

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.610 
okay that's my counts done and I'll
finish<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.630> main<00:02:56.840> part<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.290> pattern

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
finish the main part for pattern

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.140 
finish the main part for pattern
probably<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.100> going<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.340> bring<00:02:58.490> all<00:02:58.970> the

probably just going to bring all the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:13.900 
probably just going to bring all the
whites<00:02:59.590> back<00:03:00.590> over<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.670> right-hand<00:03:02.120> side

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.720 

okay<00:03:14.720> we've<00:03:15.590> got<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.860> cross<00:03:16.100> basically

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
okay we've got the cross basically

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.130 
okay we've got the cross basically

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
money so 50 odd foot of thread and we

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.850 
money so 50 odd foot of thread and we
have<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.130> pattern<00:04:57.460> which<00:04:58.090> actually<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.900> one

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
have a pattern which actually is one

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.790 
have a pattern which actually is one
centimetre<00:05:00.669> long<00:05:01.200> in<00:05:02.200> its<00:05:02.380> finished<00:05:03.240> form<00:05:04.800> so

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
centimetre long in its finished form so

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.540 
centimetre long in its finished form so
you<00:05:05.890> can<00:05:06.130> see<00:05:06.370> how<00:05:06.820> much<00:05:07.030> thread<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.479> uses<00:05:08.550> just

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
you can see how much thread it uses just

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.080 
you can see how much thread it uses just
a<00:05:11.729> convergent<00:05:12.729> or<00:05:13.290> just<00:05:14.290> flatten<00:05:15.040> off<00:05:15.160> the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690

over the top of the thread rather than

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:55.129 

ah<00:05:37.860> cute

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:03.180 

kind<00:05:55.710> of<00:05:55.740> my<00:05:55.979> game

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.510 

you

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.279 

and<00:06:30.520> then<00:06:30.669> clearly<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.509> wrap<00:06:31.720> off<00:06:31.960> the

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
and then clearly you wrap off the

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.870 
and then clearly you wrap off the
opposite<00:06:32.680> end<00:06:32.889> and<00:06:33.160> you've<00:06:33.430> got<00:06:33.639> your

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
opposite end and you've got your

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.080 
opposite end and you've got your
