we<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.489> one<00:03:03.790> product<00:03:04.269> which<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:04.989> just<00:03:05.260> lack

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
we have one product which is just lack

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.259 
we have one product which is just lack
of<00:03:05.680> primer<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.220> here<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.519> two<00:03:06.790> products

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
of primer and here we have two products

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.530 
of primer and here we have two products
which<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.540> H<00:03:08.170> coat<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.830> lack<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.130> primer<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
which is H coat and lack of primer so it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.479 
which is H coat and lack of primer so it
actually<00:03:10.690> looks<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.330> etch<00:03:14.489> isn't

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
actually looks like that the etch isn't

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.610 
actually looks like that the etch isn't
working<00:03:15.760> quite<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.269> well<00:03:16.420> as<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.840> lacquer<00:03:17.080> but

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
working quite as well as the lacquer but

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740 
working quite as well as the lacquer but
I'm<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.890> sure<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:18.940> right<00:03:19.120> here<00:03:19.150> this

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
I'm not sure and then right here this

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.270 
I'm not sure and then right here this
was<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.140> clean<00:03:20.350> steel<00:03:20.650> with<00:03:20.890> no<00:03:20.920> protection

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
was just clean steel with no protection

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.390 
was just clean steel with no protection
on<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.560> clean<00:03:23.799> steel<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.220> just

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
on it then this is clean steel with just

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.550 
on it then this is clean steel with just
paint<00:03:24.670> over<00:03:24.790> ok<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> little<00:03:25.840> bit<00:03:26.049> easier<00:03:26.440> it's

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
paint over ok a little bit easier it's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.330 
paint over ok a little bit easier it's
cold<00:03:27.480> so

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
cold so

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.910 
cold so
so<00:03:29.940> far<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.510> looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.110> best<00:03:31.260> gig<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.739> got

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
so far it looks like the best gig we got

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.300 
so far it looks like the best gig we got
going<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:33.569> etch<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.620> lacquer<00:03:34.860> primer

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
going on is the etch the lacquer primer

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.240 
going on is the etch the lacquer primer
base<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.060> clear<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.500> different<00:03:37.800> products

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
base and clear so for different products

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.960 
base and clear so for different products
over<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.940> area<00:03:39.620> okay<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.730> looks<00:03:41.879> like

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
over this area okay and it looks like

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.640 
over this area okay and it looks like
even<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.720> etch<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.440> lacquer

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
even just the etch and the lacquer

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.410 
even just the etch and the lacquer
primer<00:03:44.040> looks<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:44.700> those<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:45.060> work<00:03:45.209> pretty

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
primer looks like those to work pretty

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.030 
primer looks like those to work pretty
