00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
playing piano and we used a simple three

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.939 
playing piano and we used a simple three
microphone<00:00:40.929> setup<00:00:41.229> which<00:00:41.499> was<00:00:41.649> just<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
microphone setup which was just the

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.819 
microphone setup which was just the
vocal<00:00:42.339> mic<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.760> then<00:00:42.909> a<00:00:43.210> stereo<00:00:43.989> spaced<00:00:44.440> pair

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
vocal mic and then a stereo spaced pair

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.669 
vocal mic and then a stereo spaced pair
of<00:00:45.100> matched<00:00:45.550> ntr<00:00:46.359> ribbon<00:00:46.659> mics<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:47.469> to<00:00:47.559> give

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
of matched ntr ribbon mics just to give

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.889 
of matched ntr ribbon mics just to give
you<00:00:47.769> a<00:00:47.829> really<00:00:48.159> nice<00:00:48.339> idea<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:49.059> exactly<00:00:49.719> what

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
you a really nice idea of exactly what

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.349 
you a really nice idea of exactly what
the<00:00:50.170> ribbon<00:00:50.469> sounds<00:00:50.859> like<00:00:51.069> now<00:00:51.339> on<00:00:51.579> our<00:00:52.030> shoots

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
the ribbon sounds like now on our shoots

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.029 
the ribbon sounds like now on our shoots
one<00:00:52.719> of<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.899> big<00:00:53.049> challenges<00:00:53.469> with<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.769> audio

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
one of the big challenges with the audio

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.919 
one of the big challenges with the audio
is<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.549> always<00:00:54.699> want<00:00:54.819> to<00:00:55.030> show<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
is that we always want to show the

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.509 
is that we always want to show the
microphones<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.620> their<00:00:56.799> raw<00:00:57.010> state

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
microphones in their raw state

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.129 
microphones in their raw state
now<00:00:57.879> most<00:00:58.120> recordings<00:00:58.569> that<00:00:58.719> you<00:00:58.809> would<00:00:58.929> hear

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
now most recordings that you would hear

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.319 
now most recordings that you would hear
usually<00:00:59.649> would<00:00:59.799> be<00:00:59.920> heavily<00:01:00.309> processed<00:01:00.489> but

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
usually would be heavily processed but

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.419 
usually would be heavily processed but
what<00:01:01.539> we<00:01:01.659> want<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.929> do<00:01:02.139> is<00:01:02.559> always<00:01:02.889> record<00:01:03.370> a

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
what we want to do is always record a

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.450 
what we want to do is always record a
really<00:01:03.670> nice<00:01:03.819> clean<00:01:04.239> take<00:01:04.960> with<00:01:05.320> as<00:01:05.649> little<00:01:06.280> or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
really nice clean take with as little or

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.100 
really nice clean take with as little or
no<00:01:06.640> processing<00:01:07.119> if<00:01:07.360> possible<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.049> you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
no processing if possible so that you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.300 
no processing if possible so that you
can<00:01:08.229> actually<00:01:08.350> hear<00:01:08.619> what<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.860> microphone

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
can actually hear what the microphone

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.340 
can actually hear what the microphone
sounds<00:01:09.640> like<00:01:09.789> so<00:01:10.090> as<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.659> can<00:01:10.750> see<00:01:10.810> here<00:01:11.200> we've

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
sounds like so as you can see here we've

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
sounds like so as you can see here we've
got<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.560> bit<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:11.860> an<00:01:11.950> angle<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.520> vocal<00:01:12.880> mic

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
got a bit of an angle on the vocal mic

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.090 
got a bit of an angle on the vocal mic
there<00:01:13.659> was<00:01:13.750> two<00:01:13.930> reasons<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:14.439> that<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
there was two reasons for that and the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.370 
there was two reasons for that and the
first<00:01:15.369> being<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.390> wanted<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.990> actually

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
first being that we wanted to actually

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.560 
first being that we wanted to actually
get<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> nice<00:01:17.770> bit<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.039> isolation<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.180> vocal

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
get a nice bit of isolation on the vocal

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.330 
get a nice bit of isolation on the vocal
mic<00:01:19.750> now<00:01:20.079> with<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.619> ribbon<00:01:20.859> microphone

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
mic now with the ribbon microphone

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.160 
mic now with the ribbon microphone
you've<00:01:21.520> got<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.939> bidirectional<00:01:22.630> pickup

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
you've got a bidirectional pickup

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.420 
you've got a bidirectional pickup
pattern<00:01:23.439> meaning<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.890> picks<00:01:24.039> up<00:01:24.159> in<00:01:24.310> the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
pattern meaning that it picks up in the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.399 
pattern meaning that it picks up in the
front<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.030> rear<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.600> microphone<00:01:26.170> and

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
front and the rear of the microphone and

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.919 
front and the rear of the microphone and
it<00:01:26.530> actually<00:01:26.649> rejects<00:01:27.399> sound<00:01:27.789> all<00:01:28.149> around<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
it actually rejects sound all around the

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.719 
it actually rejects sound all around the
sides<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.649> ribbon<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.159> by<00:01:30.340> having<00:01:30.609> that

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
sides of the ribbon so by having that

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.099 
sides of the ribbon so by having that
angle<00:01:31.179> that<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.420> have<00:01:31.539> on<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.689> microphone

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
angle that we have on the microphone

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.859 
angle that we have on the microphone
there<00:01:32.320> we're<00:01:33.070> rejecting<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:34.060> piano<00:01:34.420> sound<00:01:34.719> as

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
there we're rejecting the piano sound as

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.300 
there we're rejecting the piano sound as
much<00:01:34.899> as<00:01:35.170> possible<00:01:35.380> without<00:01:35.740> affecting<00:01:36.189> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
much as possible without affecting the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.999 
much as possible without affecting the
vocal<00:01:36.670> now<00:01:37.240> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.750> piano<00:01:38.289> microphones

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
vocal now with the piano microphones

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.370 
vocal now with the piano microphones
we've<00:01:39.219> got<00:01:39.369> a<00:01:39.399> spaced<00:01:39.789> pair<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.750> idea<00:01:41.140> there

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
we've got a spaced pair the idea there

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.499 
we've got a spaced pair the idea there
was<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.799> just<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.369> little<00:01:42.820> nice<00:01:43.149> bit<00:01:43.179> of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
was to just have a little nice bit of

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.929 
was to just have a little nice bit of
stereo<00:01:43.990> ambience<00:01:44.560> without<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:45.670> being<00:01:45.789> too

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
stereo ambience without it being too

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.120 
stereo ambience without it being too
hyper<00:01:46.509> stereo<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.320> get<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.499> realistic

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
hyper stereo so that you get a realistic

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.279 
hyper stereo so that you get a realistic

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
microphones came down to produce this

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.069 
microphones came down to produce this
session<00:01:54.609> and<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.030> was<00:01:55.149> his<00:01:55.390> choice<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.960> the

and<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.079> actually<00:01:59.200> spent<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.679> fair<00:01:59.829> bit<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.100> time

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
and we actually spent a fair bit of time

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.520 
and we actually spent a fair bit of time
just<00:02:00.579> moving<00:02:01.359> the<00:02:01.420> microphones<00:02:01.899> around<00:02:02.079> and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
just moving the microphones around and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.289 
just moving the microphones around and
getting<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.069> perfect<00:02:03.429> position<00:02:03.549> before<00:02:04.060> Katy

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
getting the perfect position before Katy

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.419 
getting the perfect position before Katy
arrived<00:02:04.659> just<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.679> it<00:02:05.770> was<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.399> know

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
arrived just so that it was a you know

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.010 
arrived just so that it was a you know
I'm<00:02:06.640> more<00:02:06.759> professional<00:02:07.270> setup<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.719> she<00:02:07.869> can

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
I'm more professional setup that she can

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.260 
I'm more professional setup that she can
just<00:02:08.170> come<00:02:08.350> sit<00:02:08.740> down<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.280> perform<00:02:09.970> without

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
just come sit down and perform without

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
just come sit down and perform without
having<00:02:10.510> to<00:02:10.570> worry<00:02:10.750> about<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.020> technical

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
having to worry about the technical

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.700 
having to worry about the technical
aspects<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.610> setup<00:02:12.820> or<00:02:13.090> wait<00:02:13.300> for

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
aspects of this setup or wait for

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
aspects of this setup or wait for
to<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> audio<00:02:14.580> right<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to get the audio right so that was the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
to get the audio right so that was the
biggest<00:02:15.870> challenge<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.410> audio<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.890> think

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
biggest challenge with the audio I think

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.910 
biggest challenge with the audio I think
the<00:02:17.370> result<00:02:17.820> speaks<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.210> itself<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.930> NCR<00:02:19.620> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the result speaks for itself the NCR is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.220 
the result speaks for itself the NCR is
an<00:02:20.550> incredible<00:02:20.940> mic<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.450> an<00:02:21.540> active<00:02:21.930> ribbon

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
an incredible mic it's an active ribbon

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.270 
an incredible mic it's an active ribbon
so<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.530> didn't<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.890> worry<00:02:23.070> about

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
so we didn't have to worry about

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.370 
so we didn't have to worry about
damaging<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.850> ribbon<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.240> phantom<00:02:24.600> power

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
damaging the ribbon with phantom power

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.920 
damaging the ribbon with phantom power
we<00:02:25.680> ran<00:02:25.890> directly<00:02:26.220> into<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.790> Neve<00:02:27.150> 88<00:02:27.720> our

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
we ran directly into a Neve 88 our

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.140 
we ran directly into a Neve 88 our
console<00:02:28.620> completely<00:02:29.370> dry<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:29.910> was<00:02:30.000> no

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
console completely dry so there was no

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.870 
console completely dry so there was no
compression<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.930> there<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.290> no<00:02:31.560> EQ<00:02:32.130> recorded

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
compression and there was no EQ recorded

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.910 
compression and there was no EQ recorded
straight<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.270> tape<00:02:33.480> at<00:02:33.630> 96<00:02:34.110> K<00:02:34.320> into<00:02:34.680> Pro<00:02:34.890> Tools

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
straight to tape at 96 K into Pro Tools

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
straight to tape at 96 K into Pro Tools
tell<00:02:35.640> us<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.820> bit<00:02:35.910> about<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.210> stereo<00:02:36.480> bar<00:02:36.660> -

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
tell us a bit about the stereo bar -

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.750 
tell us a bit about the stereo bar -
it's<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.110> prototype<00:02:37.350> yeah<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> stereo<00:02:38.610> bar

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
it's a prototype yeah so the stereo bar

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.570 
it's a prototype yeah so the stereo bar
is<00:02:38.850> actually<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.420> custom<00:02:39.980> rode<00:02:40.980> stereo<00:02:41.280> bar

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
is actually a custom rode stereo bar

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.180 
is actually a custom rode stereo bar
it's<00:02:41.760> based<00:02:42.000> off<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.390> same<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> SB<00:02:43.800> -<00:02:43.980> 20

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's based off the same as the SB - 20

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.350 
it's based off the same as the SB - 20
centimeter<00:02:44.520> stereo<00:02:44.820> bar<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.180> one's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
centimeter stereo bar but this one's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.570 
centimeter stereo bar but this one's
actually<00:02:45.480> 70<00:02:46.020> centimeters<00:02:46.590> long<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.400> just

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
actually 70 centimeters long that just

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
actually 70 centimeters long that just
enabled<00:02:47.940> us<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.210> get<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> microphones<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
enabled us to get the microphones in the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.260 
enabled us to get the microphones in the
exact<00:02:49.740> position<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.400> wanted<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.060> was<00:02:51.240> a

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
exact position that we wanted it was a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.510 
exact position that we wanted it was a
slightly<00:02:51.660> wider<00:02:52.230> position<00:02:52.920> than<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.370> we

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
slightly wider position than what we

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.400 
slightly wider position than what we
could<00:02:53.700> do<00:02:53.850> with<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.210> standard<00:02:54.630> stereo<00:02:54.810> bar<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
could do with the standard stereo bar so

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.920 
could do with the standard stereo bar so
this<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> 35<00:02:56.400> centimeter<00:02:56.940> spaced<00:02:57.270> pair<00:02:57.510> all

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this was a 35 centimeter spaced pair all

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.210 
this was a 35 centimeter spaced pair all
right<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.230> we've<00:02:58.380> gone<00:02:58.590> through<00:02:58.650> the

that people can get an idea of what was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
that people can get an idea of what was
used<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.570> this<00:03:12.660> production<00:03:13.080> yes<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.680> because

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
used on this production yes so because

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.980 
used on this production yes so because
it<00:03:14.160> was<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.340> live<00:03:14.940> tape<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.630> need<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> make

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
it was a live tape we do need to make

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
say well you know you checkerboard

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.690 
say well you know you checkerboard
certain<00:03:55.260> things<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:55.890> area<00:03:56.070> might<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.460> too

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
certain things or that area might be too

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.270 
certain things or that area might be too
bright<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.210> that<00:03:57.330> area<00:03:57.630> might<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.810> too<00:03:58.020> dark

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
bright and that area might be too dark

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.260 
bright and that area might be too dark
initial<00:03:59.280> evening<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.700> we<00:03:59.910> had<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> couple

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
initial evening I think we had a couple

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.940 
initial evening I think we had a couple
of<00:04:00.540> treatments<00:04:01.020> we<00:04:01.050> thought<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.590> could<00:04:01.860> either

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
of treatments we thought we could either

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.470 
of treatments we thought we could either
do<00:04:02.160> use<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> color<00:04:02.550> palette<00:04:02.850> or<00:04:02.940> color<00:04:03.120> wash<00:04:03.330> in

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
do use a color palette or color wash in

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.820 
do use a color palette or color wash in
the<00:04:03.570> background<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.050> we<00:04:04.140> decided<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.590> stay

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
the background but we decided to stay

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.310 
the background but we decided to stay
with<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> very<00:04:05.280> simple<00:04:06.030> color<00:04:06.630> temperature<00:04:07.140> and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
with a very simple color temperature and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.220 
with a very simple color temperature and
then<00:04:08.100> light<00:04:08.370> around<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.870> we<00:04:09.990> could

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
then light around that so that we could

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.230 
then light around that so that we could
like<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.590> said<00:04:10.830> separate<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.580> mic<00:04:11.790> itself

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
like you said separate the mic itself

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.020

open<00:04:47.100> at<00:04:47.220> one<00:04:47.490> focal<00:04:47.880> length<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.540> rest<00:04:48.780> we

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
open at one focal length but the rest we

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.170 
open at one focal length but the rest we
decided<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.800> we<00:04:50.010> were<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.790> try<00:04:51.000> and

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
decided that we were going to try and

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.600 
decided that we were going to try and
shoot<00:04:51.450> above<00:04:51.900> 2.8<00:04:52.470> pilot<00:04:52.980> reason<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.430> because

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
shoot above 2.8 pilot reason is because

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.180 
shoot above 2.8 pilot reason is because
sometimes<00:04:54.420> lenses<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:55.020> prone<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.410> chromatic

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
sometimes lenses are prone to chromatic

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.580 
sometimes lenses are prone to chromatic
aberrations<00:04:56.700> or<00:04:57.140> collaborations<00:04:58.140> which<00:04:58.380> is

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
aberrations or collaborations which is

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
aberrations or collaborations which is
not<00:04:58.800> really<00:04:59.070> nice<00:04:59.220> wide<00:04:59.670> opens<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.300> also<00:05:00.600> a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
not really nice wide opens and also a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.600 
not really nice wide opens and also a
particular<00:05:01.200> lens<00:05:01.530> does<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> sweet<00:05:02.310> spot

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
particular lens does have a sweet spot

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.670 
particular lens does have a sweet spot
at<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.940> certain<00:05:03.270> if<00:05:03.510> stop<00:05:03.810> as<00:05:03.930> well<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.500> guess

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
at a certain if stop as well and I guess

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.290 
at a certain if stop as well and I guess
one<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.040> challenges<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.180> would

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
one of the challenges that you would

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.480 
one of the challenges that you would
have<00:05:06.360> had<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.690> keeping<00:05:07.320> both<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.010> Mike<00:05:08.220> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
have had is keeping both the Mike and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.480 
have had is keeping both the Mike and
Katie<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.570> focus<00:05:10.320> on<00:05:10.560> some<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.800> those<00:05:10.950> longer

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
Katie in focus on some of those longer

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.290 
Katie in focus on some of those longer
shots<00:05:12.020> where<00:05:13.020> if<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.260> went<00:05:13.440> too<00:05:13.650> shallow

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
shots where if you went too shallow

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.760 
shots where if you went too shallow
you'd<00:05:15.720> have<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.020> make<00:05:16.170> a<00:05:16.200> decision<00:05:16.650> between

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
you'd have to make a decision between

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.320 
you'd have to make a decision between
the<00:05:17.100> two<00:05:17.130> wouldn't<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.580> there's<00:05:18.000> always<00:05:18.180> a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
the two wouldn't you there's always a

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.730 
the two wouldn't you there's always a
trade-off<00:05:18.600> when<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.050> you<00:05:19.260> should<00:05:19.470> know<00:05:19.560> wide

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
trade-off when you you should know wide

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.010 
trade-off when you you should know wide
open<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.400> your<00:05:20.610> focal<00:05:21.210> distances<00:05:21.840> like

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
open you know your focal distances like

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.780 
open you know your focal distances like
wafer-thin<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.890> have<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.340> keep<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.640> in

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
wafer-thin so you have to keep that in

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.490 
wafer-thin so you have to keep that in
mind<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.330> particularly<00:05:25.080> when<00:05:25.290> you're<00:05:25.410> having

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
mind and particularly when you're having

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.920 
mind and particularly when you're having
moving<00:05:25.890> shots<00:05:26.130> as<00:05:26.280> well<00:05:26.430> dynamic<00:05:27.300> movement

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
moving shots as well dynamic movement

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.000 
moving shots as well dynamic movement
you<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.350> make<00:05:28.530> sure<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.920> don't

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
you have to make sure that you don't

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.410 
you have to make sure that you don't
want<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.250> shoot<00:05:29.400> too<00:05:29.700> wide<00:05:29.910> open<00:05:30.240> because

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
want to shoot too wide open because

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.570 
want to shoot too wide open because
you're<00:05:30.780> gonna<00:05:30.870> lose<00:05:31.230> focus<00:05:31.440> certain<00:05:32.250> lenses

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
you're gonna lose focus certain lenses

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.880 
you're gonna lose focus certain lenses
have<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.820> sweet<00:05:33.390> spot<00:05:33.540> for<00:05:34.050> example<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.500> 28

generally around f4i fine given the

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.740 
generally around f4i fine given the

in<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.790> same<00:05:47.970> space<00:05:48.360> we<00:05:48.600> actually<00:05:48.930> had<00:05:49.050> to

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
in the same space we actually had to

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.020 
in the same space we actually had to
kick<00:05:49.410> basically<00:05:50.280> everyone<00:05:50.580> out<00:05:50.700> of<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:50.850> room

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
kick basically everyone out of the room

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.700 
kick basically everyone out of the room
except<00:05:51.330> for<00:05:51.360> three<00:05:51.660> people<00:05:51.870> right<00:05:52.200> other<00:05:52.470> than

except for three people right other than

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.980 
except for three people right other than
Katie<00:05:52.980> herself<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:54.120> was<00:05:54.270> important<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.690> limit

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
Katie herself it was important to limit

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.660 
Katie herself it was important to limit
the<00:05:55.140> amount<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.470> our<00:05:55.680> operators<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.400> hence

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
the amount of our operators and hence

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.550 
the amount of our operators and hence
the<00:05:56.880> amount<00:05:57.420> of<00:05:57.480> I<00:05:57.660> guess<00:05:57.930> movement<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.470> the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
the amount of I guess movement in the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.230 
the amount of I guess movement in the
room<00:05:58.800> so<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.280> lot<00:05:59.610> of<00:05:59.640> us<00:05:59.730> were<00:05:59.880> multitasking

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
room so a lot of us were multitasking

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.960 
room so a lot of us were multitasking
keeping<00:06:00.960> an<00:06:01.050> eye<00:06:01.200> on<00:06:01.230> ISO<00:06:01.920> cams<00:06:02.250> as<00:06:02.610> well<00:06:02.790> as

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
keeping an eye on ISO cams as well as

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.970 
keeping an eye on ISO cams as well as
some<00:06:03.240> of<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.330> motion<00:06:03.690> shots<00:06:03.930> Clinton<00:06:04.620> was<00:06:04.800> on

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
some of the motion shots Clinton was on

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.220 
some of the motion shots Clinton was on
a<00:06:05.280> jib<00:06:05.700> and<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.270> slider<00:06:06.570> at<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.780> same<00:06:06.990> time

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
a jib and a slider at the same time

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.300 
a jib and a slider at the same time
which<00:06:07.500> is<00:06:07.530> quite<00:06:07.710> impressive

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
which is quite impressive

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.150 
which is quite impressive
I<00:06:08.340> was<00:06:08.730> manning<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.600> city<00:06:09.810> 200<00:06:10.350> and<00:06:10.770> an<00:06:10.860> ISO

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
I was manning the city 200 and an ISO

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.130 
I was manning the city 200 and an ISO
shot<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.610> goods<00:06:12.030> he<00:06:12.150> was<00:06:12.330> on<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.870> floor

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
shot and goods he was on the floor

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.380 
shot and goods he was on the floor
looking<00:06:13.590> after<00:06:13.860> slider<00:06:14.160> and<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.670> shot<00:06:15.060> over<00:06:15.300> his

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
looking after slider and a shot over his

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.450 
looking after slider and a shot over his
shoulders<00:06:15.750> as<00:06:15.810> well<00:06:15.840> so<00:06:16.260> yeah<00:06:16.680> yes<00:06:16.920> so<00:06:17.160> we<00:06:17.310> had

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
shoulders as well so yeah yes so we had

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.120 
shoulders as well so yeah yes so we had
a<00:06:17.670> director's<00:06:18.390> monitor<00:06:18.960> at<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.260> same<00:06:19.500> time<00:06:19.740> so

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
a director's monitor at the same time so

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.560 
a director's monitor at the same time so
that<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.490> marketing<00:06:20.880> department<00:06:21.300> could<00:06:21.420> keep

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
that the marketing department could keep
