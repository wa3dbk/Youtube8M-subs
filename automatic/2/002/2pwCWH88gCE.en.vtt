00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
swiftly snook I think stuff might be

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.080 
swiftly snook I think stuff might be
faster<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> get<00:02:46.290> an<00:02:46.380> ice<00:02:46.500> cream<00:02:46.680> off<00:02:47.090> that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

and I think that should one hit KO and
