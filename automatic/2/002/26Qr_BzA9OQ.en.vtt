00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
really feels like a kind of war zone but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.880 
really feels like a kind of war zone but
nothing<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> real<00:01:04.589> life<00:01:04.739> situation

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
nothing to a real life situation

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789 
nothing to a real life situation
obviously<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> sound<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.560> sound

obviously but are the sound the sound

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
obviously but are the sound the sound
always<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> big<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.659> sound

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
always is a big thing so the sound

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.620 
always is a big thing so the sound
really<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.380> make<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> game<00:01:11.270> really<00:01:12.270> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

really<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.450> mean<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> only<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.710> beta<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
really good I mean it is only a beta so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.520 
really good I mean it is only a beta so
the<00:01:33.180> clipping<00:01:33.540> isn't<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.869> great<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the clipping isn't that great and if you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.539 
the clipping isn't that great and if you
don't<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.890> clipping<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> watch<00:01:35.520> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
don't know what clipping is watch this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
don't know what clipping is watch this
example<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:37.110> stuck<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.530> tree

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
example up here I get stuck in that tree

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.380 
example up here I get stuck in that tree
when<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> easily<00:01:38.369> could<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.729> light<00:01:38.880> ran<00:01:39.090> under

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
when I easily could have light ran under

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
when I easily could have light ran under
it<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.750> real<00:01:39.990> life<00:01:40.140> situation<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.280> things

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it it was real life situation so things

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
it it was real life situation so things
like<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> should<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.509> fixed<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.140> hopefully

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
like that should be fixed and hopefully

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.120 
like that should be fixed and hopefully
with<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.950> beta<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> fixed<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> uh

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
with this beta they will be fixed so uh

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
with this beta they will be fixed so uh
I<00:01:47.850> guess<00:01:48.030> I'll<00:01:48.360> talk<00:01:48.509> about<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.780> classes<00:01:49.229> are

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I guess I'll talk about the classes are

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
I guess I'll talk about the classes are
there's<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.189> trooper<00:01:50.820> class<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.360> SpecOps<00:01:52.170> class

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there's a trooper class a SpecOps class

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859 
there's a trooper class a SpecOps class
and<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.040> sniper<00:01:53.310> class<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> moment<00:01:53.869> i'm

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and a sniper class at the moment i'm

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
and a sniper class at the moment i'm
using<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> trooper<00:01:55.530> class<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> red<00:01:56.430> dot

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
using the trooper class with the red dot

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.539 
using the trooper class with the red dot
sight<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.180> new<00:01:57.630> tube<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
sight and new tube you are it's got the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
sight and new tube you are it's got the
same<00:01:59.700> progression<00:01:59.909> system<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.750> bad<00:02:00.930> company<00:02:01.380> 2

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
same progression system as bad company 2

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.770 
same progression system as bad company 2
where<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.219> unlock<00:02:02.670> stuff<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.390> use<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
where you unlock stuff the more use that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
where you unlock stuff the more use that
class<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.320> unlock<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> red<00:02:04.829> dot<00:02:05.009> sight<00:02:05.250> in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
class and i unlock the red dot sight in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.550 
class and i unlock the red dot sight in
this<00:02:05.610> match<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:08.039> spec<00:02:08.250> ops<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
this match so the spec ops they get a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
this match so the spec ops they get a
aks-74u<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> rocket<00:02:11.459> launcher<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.150> all

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
aks-74u and a rocket launcher and all

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.530 
aks-74u and a rocket launcher and all
classes<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.989> track<00:02:13.230> off

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
classes have track off

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.880 
classes have track off
store<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.980> sniper<00:02:15.579> class<00:02:15.819> gets<00:02:16.379> SVD<00:02:17.379> for

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
store and the sniper class gets SVD for

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.709 
store and the sniper class gets SVD for
the<00:02:17.980> Taliban<00:02:18.400> anyway<00:02:18.760> which<00:02:18.969> was<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.390> side<00:02:19.689> i

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
the Taliban anyway which was the side i

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.770 
the Taliban anyway which was the side i
was<00:02:19.900> playing<00:02:20.109> on<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.769> other<00:02:20.890> side<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
was playing on and the other side is the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.039 
was playing on and the other side is the
US<00:02:22.780> Marine<00:02:23.109> Corps<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.379> believe<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.719> game

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
US Marine Corps I believe so this game

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.309 
US Marine Corps I believe so this game
type<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.590> kind<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.689> domination<00:02:28.689> and<00:02:28.930> rush

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
type is kind of like domination and rush

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.220 
type is kind of like domination and rush
from<00:02:29.709> bad<00:02:29.920> company<00:02:30.280> 2<00:02:30.430> combined<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:30.939> one

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
from bad company 2 combined in one

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.660 
from bad company 2 combined in one
usually<00:02:32.230> it'll<00:02:32.470> come<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.069> two-part<00:02:33.400> like

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
usually it'll come in the two-part like

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
usually it'll come in the two-part like
they'll<00:02:33.879> have<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.060> blow<00:02:34.359> up<00:02:34.480> an<00:02:34.599> objective

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
they'll have to blow up an objective

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.589 
they'll have to blow up an objective
like<00:02:36.250> such<00:02:36.459> as<00:02:36.579> like<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> gate<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.060> something

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
like such as like a gate or something

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.899 
like such as like a gate or something
and<00:02:38.079> then<00:02:38.230> they'll<00:02:38.379> have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> capture<00:02:38.909> an

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
and then they'll have to capture an

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.759 
and then they'll have to capture an
objective<00:02:40.389> not<00:02:40.510> too<00:02:40.629> far<00:02:40.840> away<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.230> so

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
objective not too far away from that so

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.619 
objective not too far away from that so
it's<00:02:42.010> it's<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.549> really<00:02:42.760> cool<00:02:42.969> game<00:02:43.180> type<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.569> if

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
it's it's a really cool game type and if

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.240 
it's it's a really cool game type and if
you<00:02:43.719> like<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:43.959> there<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.620> another<00:02:44.799> game<00:02:45.010> type

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
you like it there is another game type

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.190 
you like it there is another game type
which<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.549> like<00:02:45.730> team<00:02:46.389> deathmatch<00:02:46.780> kind<00:02:47.109> of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
which is like team deathmatch kind of

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.539 
which is like team deathmatch kind of
but<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.379> haven't<00:02:47.650> had<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.769> chance<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:48.129> play<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
but I haven't had a chance to play that

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.920 
but I haven't had a chance to play that
I<00:02:48.700> think<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.950> salt<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.159> something<00:02:51.489> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
I think this is like salt or something I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.289 
I think this is like salt or something I
go<00:02:52.930> remember<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.799> this<00:02:54.459> match<00:02:54.790> originally

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
go remember that this match originally

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.849 
go remember that this match originally
went<00:02:55.450> for<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.629> 30<00:02:55.930> minutes<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.409> I<00:02:56.439> just<00:02:56.500> cut

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
went for about 30 minutes so I just cut

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.259 
went for about 30 minutes so I just cut
out<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.250> boring<00:02:57.489> bits<00:02:57.700> where<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.060> was<00:02:58.209> just

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
out all the boring bits where I was just

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.110 
out all the boring bits where I was just
like<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.540> know<00:02:58.750> checking<00:02:59.079> things<00:02:59.349> out<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.889> uh

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
like you know checking things out and uh

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
like you know checking things out and uh
was<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.299> being<00:03:01.480> sneaky<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.409> on<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> Taliban

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
was just being sneaky so on the Taliban

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.929 
was just being sneaky so on the Taliban
side<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.459> do<00:03:03.609> have<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.909> be<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.269> sneaky

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
side you do have to be really sneaky

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.170 
side you do have to be really sneaky
since<00:03:06.939> uh<00:03:07.290> well<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:09.040> know<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.459> as<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:10.000> can

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
since uh well you know that as you can

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.970 
since uh well you know that as you can
see<00:03:10.359> before<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:11.169> US<00:03:11.349> Marine<00:03:11.620> Corps<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
see before the US Marine Corps have a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.190 
see before the US Marine Corps have a
tank<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> kind<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.419> have<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.599> like<00:03:13.720> hide

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
tank so you kind of have to like hide

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.229 
tank so you kind of have to like hide
away<00:03:14.379> little<00:03:15.010> crevices<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.489> staff<00:03:15.819> doing

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
away little crevices and staff doing

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.330 
away little crevices and staff doing
what<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.450> Taliban<00:03:16.810> do<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.349> uh<00:03:17.979> you<00:03:18.310> know

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
what the Taliban do and uh you know

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.520 
what the Taliban do and uh you know
surprise<00:03:19.000> your<00:03:19.209> enemy<00:03:19.269> because<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:20.409> is

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
surprise your enemy because there is

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.680 
surprise your enemy because there is
quite<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.829> lot<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.280> Marines<00:03:21.609> like<00:03:22.120> rushing

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
quite a lot of the Marines like rushing

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.259 
quite a lot of the Marines like rushing
the<00:03:22.780> area<00:03:23.280> let's<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.430> your<00:03:24.549> best<00:03:24.669> at<00:03:24.879> defending

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
the area let's do your best at defending

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.390 
the area let's do your best at defending
it<00:03:25.419> so<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:28.359> far<00:03:28.419> I<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.290> game<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:29.919> it's

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
it so so far I like this game it's it's

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.039 
it so so far I like this game it's it's
probably<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:30.909> going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> pick<00:03:31.329> up<00:03:31.510> as<00:03:31.659> well<00:03:31.870> as

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
probably not going to pick up as well as

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.619 
probably not going to pick up as well as
a<00:03:32.079> black<00:03:33.040> ops<00:03:33.310> for<00:03:33.579> sure<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.359> definitely

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
a black ops for sure but it's definitely

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.390 
a black ops for sure but it's definitely
going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> be<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.169> force<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:35.949> be<00:03:36.040> reckoned<00:03:36.129> with

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
going to be a force to be reckoned with

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.849 
going to be a force to be reckoned with
and<00:03:36.609> it's<00:03:36.790> pretty<00:03:37.000> cool<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:38.169> this<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.560> where<00:03:38.799> I

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
and it's pretty cool so this is where I

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.640 
and it's pretty cool so this is where I
go<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.129> that<00:03:39.250> little<00:03:39.430> banana<00:03:39.790> tear<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.650> was

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
go on that little banana tear here I was

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.649 
go on that little banana tear here I was
just<00:03:41.829> pretty<00:03:42.220> much<00:03:42.400> what<00:03:42.579> I<00:03:42.609> decided<00:03:43.510> my

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
just pretty much what I decided my

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.869 
just pretty much what I decided my
strategy<00:03:44.079> was<00:03:44.229> just<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.650> like<00:03:44.919> hold<00:03:45.159> every<00:03:45.669> in

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
strategy was just to like hold every in

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.399 
strategy was just to like hold every in
each<00:03:46.000> other<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.750> hold<00:03:46.900> down<00:03:47.109> a<00:03:47.139> good

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
each other just to hold down a good

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.750 
each other just to hold down a good
place<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.829> had<00:03:47.949> like<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.190> good<00:03:48.459> amount<00:03:48.639> of

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
place they had like a good amount of

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.629 
place they had like a good amount of
cover<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.290> patrol<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:51.040> area<00:03:51.190> I

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
cover and just like patrol that area I

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.280 
cover and just like patrol that area I
mean<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.150> can<00:03:52.269> call<00:03:52.479> it<00:03:52.569> capping<00:03:52.870> if<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.079> want

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
mean you can call it capping if you want

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.379 
mean you can call it capping if you want
but<00:03:53.409> it's<00:03:53.590> effective<00:03:53.859> running<00:03:54.699> running<00:03:55.060> into

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
but it's effective running running into

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.789 
but it's effective running running into
people<00:03:55.540> in<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.930> game<00:03:56.169> just<00:03:56.319> running<00:03:56.620> into

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
people in this game just running into

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.469 
people in this game just running into
the<00:03:56.859> spawn<00:03:57.129> doesn't<00:03:57.519> really<00:03:57.639> work<00:03:57.849> out<00:03:58.060> one

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
the spawn doesn't really work out one

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.960 
the spawn doesn't really work out one
warfare<00:03:58.780> two<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.079> can<00:03:59.319> be<00:03:59.889> good<00:03:59.919> at<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.819> this

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
warfare two it can be good at it in this

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.349 
warfare two it can be good at it in this
game<00:04:01.180> definitely<00:04:01.900> not<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.400> started<00:04:03.879> I<00:04:04.000> was

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
game definitely not so I started I was

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.449 
game definitely not so I started I was
just<00:04:04.479> patrolling<00:04:04.870> this<00:04:05.079> area<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.129> managed

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
just patrolling this area and I managed

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.189 
just patrolling this area and I managed
to<00:04:06.609> pick<00:04:06.790> up<00:04:06.939> one<00:04:07.329> of<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.540> killstreaks<00:04:08.019> which

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
to pick up one of the killstreaks which

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.050 
to pick up one of the killstreaks which
was<00:04:08.349> an<00:04:08.530> air<00:04:08.709> strike<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.609> believe<00:04:09.819> one<00:04:10.030> of

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
was an air strike I do believe one of

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.899 
was an air strike I do believe one of
the<00:04:10.209> other<00:04:10.419> killstreaks<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.049> UAV<00:04:12.009> I<00:04:12.430> think

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
the other killstreaks is a UAV I think

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.460 
the other killstreaks is a UAV I think
it<00:04:13.000> works<00:04:13.150> out<00:04:13.419> like<00:04:13.599> you<00:04:13.870> get<00:04:14.169> a<00:04:14.199> choice

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
it works out like you get a choice

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.580 
it works out like you get a choice
between<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.979> two<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:16.030> it's<00:04:16.989> down<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.349> bottom

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
between the two so it's down the bottom

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.920 
between the two so it's down the bottom
there<00:04:17.620> think<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.310> UAV<00:04:18.609> or<00:04:19.000> an<00:04:19.419> air<00:04:19.690> strike

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
there think it's a UAV or an air strike

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.990 
there think it's a UAV or an air strike
or<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:20.229> like<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.919> i<00:04:20.949> use<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.400> UAV<00:04:21.849> that

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
or so like that so i use the UAV that

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.040 
or so like that so i use the UAV that
was<00:04:22.120> already<00:04:22.330> up<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.630> as<00:04:22.779> you<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:23.020> see

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
was already up and as you can see

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.980 
was already up and as you can see
there's<00:04:23.349> a<00:04:23.409> shitload

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
there's a shitload

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.170 
there's a shitload
orange<00:04:24.380> dots<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:24.979> just<00:04:25.099> placed<00:04:25.340> oh<00:04:25.580> right

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
orange dots and I just placed oh right

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.300 
orange dots and I just placed oh right
near<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.449> gate<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.590> think<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.919> pick<00:04:28.160> up

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
near that gate and I think I pick up

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.659 
near that gate and I think I pick up
about<00:04:28.430> six<00:04:28.819> kills<00:04:29.180> there<00:04:29.509> so<00:04:30.229> that<00:04:30.259> was<00:04:30.590> really

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
about six kills there so that was really

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.300 
about six kills there so that was really
boosted<00:04:31.669> my<00:04:31.729> score<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> shitload<00:04:33.190> we<00:04:34.190> do

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
boosted my score a shitload we do

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.339 
boosted my score a shitload we do
actually<00:04:34.460> win<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:34.970> game<00:04:35.180> which<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.930> mean<00:04:36.139> no

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
actually win the game which I mean no

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:38.499 
actually win the game which I mean no
lose<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.919> game<00:04:37.099> but<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.849> is<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.120> best<00:04:38.270> game

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
lose the game but this is the best game

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.969 
lose the game but this is the best game
I've<00:04:38.690> got<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.020> far<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.500> that's<00:04:39.590> kind<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:39.889> like

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
I've got so far and that's kind of like

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.439 
I've got so far and that's kind of like
the<00:04:40.130> loadout<00:04:40.430> system<00:04:40.819> as<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.030> can<00:04:41.150> see<00:04:41.330> you

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
the loadout system as you can see you

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.270 
the loadout system as you can see you
can<00:04:41.569> choose<00:04:41.780> red<00:04:42.050> dot<00:04:42.199> sight<00:04:42.440> haven't<00:04:43.160> got<00:04:43.250> a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
can choose red dot sight haven't got a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.370 
can choose red dot sight haven't got a
different<00:04:43.610> barrel<00:04:43.819> yet<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.900> can<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.080> think

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
different barrel yet but you can I think

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.140 
different barrel yet but you can I think
I<00:04:45.470> had<00:04:45.590> an<00:04:45.710> extra<00:04:46.039> magazine<00:04:46.490> as<00:04:46.699> well<00:04:46.849> instead

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
I had an extra magazine as well instead

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.960 
I had an extra magazine as well instead
of<00:04:47.599> our<00:04:47.780> standard<00:04:48.259> our<00:04:48.729> standard<00:04:49.729> whatever

of our standard our standard whatever

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.620 
of our standard our standard whatever
the<00:04:50.090> hell<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.240> was<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:52.090> that's<00:04:53.090> pretty

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the hell that was that that's pretty

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.950 
the hell that was that that's pretty
cool<00:04:53.900> like<00:04:54.229> that<00:04:54.259> um<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:56.300> know<00:04:56.449> it's<00:04:56.659> really

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
cool like that um you know it's really

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.480 
cool like that um you know it's really
based<00:04:57.259> out<00:04:57.500> probably<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.919> biggest<00:04:58.099> letdown

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
based out probably the biggest letdown

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.170 
based out probably the biggest letdown
for<00:04:58.639> me<00:04:58.699> is<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.919> ping<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.490> an<00:05:01.639> issue<00:05:01.759> the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
for me is that the ping is an issue the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.180 
for me is that the ping is an issue the
ping<00:05:02.360> was<00:05:02.509> an<00:05:02.599> issue<00:05:02.690> with<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> bad<00:05:03.620> company<00:05:04.009> 2

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
ping was an issue with a bad company 2

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.529 
ping was an issue with a bad company 2
as<00:05:04.340> well<00:05:04.490> I'm<00:05:04.759> guessing<00:05:05.060> it's<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.389> my

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
as well I'm guessing it's just my

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.110 
as well I'm guessing it's just my
location<00:05:06.169> really<00:05:06.289> bit<00:05:06.620> like<00:05:07.220> if<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.789> until

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
location really bit like if it's until

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.770 
location really bit like if it's until
two-on-one<00:05:08.630> situation<00:05:09.020> i<00:05:09.680> i'll<00:05:10.360> never<00:05:11.360> don't

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
two-on-one situation i i'll never don't

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.420 
two-on-one situation i i'll never don't
think<00:05:12.020> i'll<00:05:12.199> be<00:05:12.259> very<00:05:12.560> lucky<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:13.009> win<00:05:13.220> because

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
think i'll be very lucky to win because

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.040 
think i'll be very lucky to win because
it<00:05:13.610> does<00:05:13.759> take<00:05:13.970> me<00:05:14.120> about<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:14.360> clip<00:05:14.659> to<00:05:14.690> kill
