time using the C FF a 3000 as a hard
drive<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.350> great<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.220> one<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> cool<00:03:32.940> new

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
drive is great but one of the cool new

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.970 
drive is great but one of the cool new
features<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> card<00:03:33.990> is<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.530> allow<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.950> to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
features of the card is to allow it to

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
features of the card is to allow it to
emulate<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.640> standard<00:03:36.060> floppy<00:03:36.390> drive

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
emulate a standard floppy drive

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.800 
emulate a standard floppy drive
controller<00:03:37.200> with<00:03:37.560> floppy<00:03:38.070> disks<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:39.600> great

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
controller with floppy disks the great

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.570 
controller with floppy disks the great
thing<00:03:39.959> about<00:03:39.990> this<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.370> use

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
thing about this is that you can use

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.550 
thing about this is that you can use
virtual<00:03:42.060> disk<00:03:42.270> images<00:03:42.690> from<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.990> internet<00:03:43.020> or
