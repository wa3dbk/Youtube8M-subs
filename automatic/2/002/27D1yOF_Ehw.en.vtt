e-flat<00:01:06.510> F

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.560 

that's<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.310> first<00:01:16.490> measure<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.240> first

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
that's the first measure of the first

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.620 
that's the first measure of the first
bar<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> second<00:01:18.320> page<00:01:18.670> just<00:01:19.670> do<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:19.880> slow

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.840 

that's<00:01:26.630> kind<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.840> how<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:26.990> goes<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.010> then<00:01:28.700> we

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
that's kind of how it goes and then we

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.570 
that's kind of how it goes and then we
shift<00:01:29.150> at<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.570> end<00:01:29.690> of<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.900> measure<00:01:30.280> up<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.310> F

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
shift at the end of that measure up to F

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.220 
shift at the end of that measure up to F
and<00:01:32.050> then<00:01:33.050> this<00:01:33.230> chord<00:01:33.560> AC<00:01:34.250> F<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:36.110> would

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
and then this chord AC F and I would

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.050 
and then this chord AC F and I would
probably<00:01:36.470> use<00:01:36.650> you're<00:01:37.430> going<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.610> use<00:01:37.760> two

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
probably use you're going to use two

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.590 
probably use you're going to use two
three<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.990> five<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.400> right<00:01:40.550> hand<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.570> that

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
in flat E flat we're gonna move up to G

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.000 
in flat E flat we're gonna move up to G
and<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.790> watch<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.270> them<00:04:53.419> together

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.130 

now<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.070> e-flat<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:58.940> this<00:04:59.060> chord<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.960> B

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
now to e-flat for this chord that the B

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.920 
now to e-flat for this chord that the B
flat<00:05:00.320> E<00:05:00.590> flat<00:05:00.620> F

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.170 

okay<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.470> here's<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.770> second<00:05:07.250> bar<00:05:07.490> second

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
okay so here's this second bar second

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:19.410 
okay so here's this second bar second
page<00:05:08.360> here<00:05:08.630> we<00:05:08.780> go<00:05:08.870> watch

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.320 

pretty<00:05:20.420> simple<00:05:21.040> so<00:05:22.040> those<00:05:22.550> two<00:05:22.790> bars<00:05:23.090> together

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
pretty simple so those two bars together

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.300 
pretty simple so those two bars together
let's<00:05:23.750> do<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:23.960> real<00:05:24.170> quick<00:05:24.380> slow<00:05:24.770> into<00:05:25.280> a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
let's do that real quick slow into a

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:51.360 
let's do that real quick slow into a
slow

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.890 

and<00:05:52.370> there<00:05:52.490> you<00:05:52.610> go<00:05:52.760> so<00:05:53.090> that's<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.630> speed<00:05:53.870> I

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
and there you go so that's the speed I

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.810 
and there you go so that's the speed I
would<00:05:54.050> be<00:05:54.260> practicing<00:05:54.830> at<00:05:54.980> and<00:05:55.190> then<00:05:55.400> try<00:05:55.760> to

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
would be practicing at and then try to

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:16.540 
would be practicing at and then try to
work<00:05:55.960> it<00:05:56.960> up<00:05:57.170> to<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.710> actual<00:05:58.190> speed

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.550 

something<00:06:17.550> more<00:06:17.670> like<00:06:17.850> that<00:06:18.000> okay<00:06:18.870> buddy<00:06:19.110> good

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
something more like that okay buddy good

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.260 
something more like that okay buddy good

luck on that and people do some more

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.800 
luck on that and people do some more
bars<00:06:21.570> after<00:06:22.140> you<00:06:22.320> get<00:06:22.410> that<00:06:22.560> down
