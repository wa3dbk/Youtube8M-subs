00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
hang on my first I start with spinner

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.400 
hang on my first I start with spinner
shafts<00:00:26.640> already<00:00:27.210> pre-made<00:00:27.630> spinner<00:00:27.960> shafts

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
shafts already pre-made spinner shafts

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.380 
shafts already pre-made spinner shafts
would<00:00:28.500> come<00:00:28.710> through<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.070> wire<00:00:29.490> loop<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.029> them

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:01:45.999 

and<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:38.180> your<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:41.629> right

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:56.980 

now<00:01:47.009> does<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> end<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> mushroom<00:01:48.270> out

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:12.740 

it's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.050> longer<00:02:03.440> piece<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:05.520> doesn't<00:02:11.750> because

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's a longer piece it doesn't because

00:02:12.750 --> 00:03:24.740 
it's a longer piece it doesn't because
it's<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:54.000> have<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:24.120> let<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.420> know<00:03:24.570> you're

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
it's we have just let you know you're

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.240 
it's we have just let you know you're
near<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.019> bottom<00:03:25.200> what's<00:03:25.590> nice<00:03:25.800> about<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
near the bottom what's nice about the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.580 
near the bottom what's nice about the
longer<00:03:26.640> length<00:03:26.850> also<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:28.050> guys<00:03:28.320> don't

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
longer length also now guys don't

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.680 
longer length also now guys don't
realize<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.370> steel<00:03:29.640> head<00:03:29.880> will<00:03:30.060> sit<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.480> off

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
realize is so steel head will sit up off

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.240 
realize is so steel head will sit up off
the<00:03:30.900> bottom<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.350> you'll<00:03:31.470> look<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.799> will<00:03:32.100> look

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
the bottom and you'll look out will look

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.060 
the bottom and you'll look out will look
up<00:03:32.489> right<00:03:32.790> if<00:03:33.299> we<00:03:33.480> got<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> small<00:03:34.110> net<00:03:34.440> compact

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
up right if we got a small net compact

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.400 
up right if we got a small net compact
let's<00:03:35.519> roll<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> run<00:03:36.239> along<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.600> deck<00:03:36.810> they

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
let's roll and run along the deck they

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.760 
let's roll and run along the deck they
can't<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> very<00:03:38.160> much

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
can't see it very much

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.680 
can't see it very much
turn<00:03:38.890> their<00:03:39.160> heads<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.580> see<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.060> Jim<00:03:40.390> you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
turn their heads to see that Jim you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.360 
turn their heads to see that Jim you
they<00:03:40.930> when<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.350> got<00:03:41.560> something<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.160> little

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
they when you got something up a little

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.430 
they when you got something up a little
higher<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.510> floats<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.870> little<00:03:43.900> bit<00:03:44.230> higher

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
higher and it floats a little bit higher

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
3:16 but I have to add with my silicon

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.050 
3:16 but I have to add with my silicon
to<00:07:40.690> make<00:07:41.080> it<00:07:41.199> so<00:07:41.380> it's<00:07:41.529> basically<00:07:42.159> Teflon

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.060 
to make it so it's basically Teflon
