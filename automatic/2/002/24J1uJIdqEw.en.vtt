much<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.630> pretty<00:02:30.810> easy<00:02:31.080> work<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:32.250> not

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
much but it's a pretty easy work I'm not

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.890 
much but it's a pretty easy work I'm not
sure<00:02:32.490> how<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:32.760> competition<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:33.540> will<00:02:33.750> be

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
sure how much competition there will be

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.530 
sure how much competition there will be
after<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:35.100> uh<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> pretty<00:02:36.360> good

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
after this but uh it is a pretty good

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.120 
after this but uh it is a pretty good
method<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.080> only<00:02:37.200> works<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.590> leg<00:02:37.830> injury

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
