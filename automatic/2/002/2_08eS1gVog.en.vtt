00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
limber though and that limberness is I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.380 
limber though and that limberness is I
think<00:01:12.590> what<00:01:12.950> who<00:01:13.400> is<00:01:13.520> one<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.880> main<00:01:14.090> things

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
think what who is one of the main things

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.330 
think what who is one of the main things
that<00:01:14.630> attracts<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.200> fish<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.590> bite<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.920> when

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
that attracts a fish to bite it when

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.590 
that attracts a fish to bite it when
you're<00:01:16.490> jigging<00:01:16.940> this<00:01:17.090> through<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.390> water

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
you're jigging this through the water

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.810 
you're jigging this through the water
that<00:01:17.899> undulation<00:01:18.859> and<00:01:19.159> movement<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.640> that

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
that undulation and movement of that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.429 
that undulation and movement of that
tail<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.600> really<00:01:20.750> trigger<00:01:21.109> bites

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
tail is what can really trigger bites

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.380 
tail is what can really trigger bites
and<00:01:22.100> then<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.369> second<00:01:22.729> thing<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.240> this

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
and then the second thing is is this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.660 
and then the second thing is is this
real<00:01:23.719> light<00:01:24.079> twister<00:01:24.590> tail<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.399> you<00:01:25.490> don't
