it's not as fast as the way long this
puzzle<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.760> still<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> fast<00:01:00.480> side<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
puzzle is still on the fast side and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
puzzle is still on the fast side and
make<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.500> uncontrollable<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.430> people<00:01:02.670> who

been corner twists particularly on the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
had some problems with touching on this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
had some problems with touching on this
piece<00:01:22.610> particularly<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.820> trying<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> do

piece particularly when I'm trying to do
black<00:01:24.360> bear<00:01:24.630> everything's<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.439> high

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
black bear everything's at very high

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
black bear everything's at very high
speeds<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> mostly<00:01:27.509> caused<00:01:27.780> by

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
speeds I think this is mostly caused by

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.569 
speeds I think this is mostly caused by
me<00:01:28.140> overshooting<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> may<00:01:29.189> also<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
me overshooting but it may also have

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.950 
me overshooting but it may also have
something<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> fact<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
something to do with the fact that the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.810 
something to do with the fact that the
pieces<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.680> move<00:01:31.890> around<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> their

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
pieces can move around a lot in their

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
pieces can move around a lot in their
spots<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.259> weird<00:01:34.470> feeling<00:01:34.890> but

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
spots it's a little weird feeling but

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.319 
spots it's a little weird feeling but
once<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.369> used<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> caches<00:01:36.180> go

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
once you're used to it the caches go

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.749 
once you're used to it the caches go
away<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> lot<00:01:36.950> overall<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.670> have

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
away a lot overall I really don't have

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
away a lot overall I really don't have
anything<00:01:39.000> bad<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.110> cube<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
anything bad to say about this cube I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
anything bad to say about this cube I
like<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> lot<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.030> think<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like it a lot and I think it's one of

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.990 
like it a lot and I think it's one of
the<00:01:42.780> best<00:01:42.960> V<00:01:43.110> cubes<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> market<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.100> would

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the best V cubes on the market I would

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
the best V cubes on the market I would
particularly<00:01:45.360> recommend<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> people<00:01:46.140> who

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
particularly recommend it to people who

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
particularly recommend it to people who
are<00:01:46.590> currently<00:01:46.770> using<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.490> long<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
are currently using a way long as the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
are currently using a way long as the
feeling<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.630> quite<00:01:48.689> similar<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
feeling is quite similar but all the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.789 
feeling is quite similar but all the
performance<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> upgraded<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> tiny<00:01:51.420> bit

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
performance is upgraded just a tiny bit

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.080 
performance is upgraded just a tiny bit
so<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> review<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so that's it for the review now I just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.340 
so that's it for the review now I just
have<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> couple<00:01:54.540> solves<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> watch

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have a couple solves for you to watch

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.679 
have a couple solves for you to watch
this<00:01:55.920> includes<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.460> five<00:01:56.729> point<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.180> three

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this includes a five point two three

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
this includes a five point two three
single<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.229> cube<00:01:58.530> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> my

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
single on this cube which is one of my

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
single on this cube which is one of my
best<00:02:00.119> salts<00:02:00.420> ever<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.079> stay<00:02:01.770> tuned<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
best salts ever so stay tuned for that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
best salts ever so stay tuned for that
