 full center the data of the municipal police of ostia are similar to those 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.769
 from previous years as if to say that there is still a lot to do for the 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.349
 road safety 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.289
 according to your data and many interesting accidents on the PC sync 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.640
 they take place in city streets, not only the high ones you hope for high 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.630
 scrolling 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.349
 server from the beginning of 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.970
 they have the sicilian auction is still until 31 august we are not over 700 incidents 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.250
 findings of which you are fatal in the city region 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.980
 on June 22, on Via Isole, Cape Verde in the walled land several cars lose the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.920
 life a pedestrian 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.100
 the first of September in via La Cornelio da Cydia Moron Ventotene biker 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 just last Saturday a mom and south and constipated limango not seriously injured in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 via pascucci in the hell the most risky roads are always the same 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.040
 entirely with you, however, he expects 57 incidents via morenco 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.680
 since the beginning of the year many of whom have come to cross with via casana are here 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.250
 soon a roundabout could arise but on the fact of the dragon roundabout 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 to be able to say that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 and it should be next I was talking about 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.350
 municipal police commissioner arrives - live confirmed me that financial 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.900
 so if he would like to pass the positive thing 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.180
 then what do I think of all the things that concern the limitation of the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.460
 speed 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.790
 total widening of visibility 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.600
 however, they are entirely necessary to guarantee the safety of the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.870
 true circulation 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.040
 always remember that 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.150
 not only the elevated walkways are enough or the hair is the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.130
 roundabout 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.299
 the black list then includes via cornelio meadow with 33 accidents 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.479
 of Alessandro Magno with 27 clashes 26 on the central Duke of Genoa 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.630
 25 on via macchia saponara the same number of countermeasures on Viale della Vittoria 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 but there are traffic police 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.800
 you have to keep 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.550
 well visible signs well done 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.280
 and then there is always the participation of citizens because if if if we do 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 I am not zebra because they are not real with using being busy 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.860
 transited accelerates that are not of danger is as if it were rubble and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.259
 someone parking us the car sora it's true we don't have bisenzio macro 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.579
 but it is a civic duty not to occupy the strange one because it puts 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.269
 is in safety and other danger
