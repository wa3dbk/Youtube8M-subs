00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.810
 first we remove the lid of the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.320
 control unit and remove the screws that 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.320
 they hold her 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 Now we can remove the lid of the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.990
 switchboard more easily we separate the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.300
 switch to the top and remove the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.009
 Three screws of the support 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.009
 control unit to remove it 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 with small flat screwdriver 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 we raise this tab and we remove the 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.410
 tube to work more easily 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 now we proceed to take the support of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.940
 the switchboard very carefully 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.200
 and in turn disengaging this black piece 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.200
 which can be seen here below 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.400
 once we have removed the support from the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.160
 switchboard 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.720
 we go below and place a cat in this 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.120
 engine point making sure that 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.980
 be well fixed if we have a 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.550
 wood we can put it so that we 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 give more security 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.050
 next with a three glass 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 we will remove the two screws hold the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.080
 motor support 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
 we will raise the engine a little with the cat and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 giving him some blows with the hand of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.200
 motor support we can see how 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 it separates upwards from the chassis 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.430
 Now carefully and a glass of 17 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.740
 we take out these three nuts that hold 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 the support 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.710
 and we are extracting the entire support 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.149
 making sure that the engine does not miss us 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.790
 goes down in the event that we are 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.570
 out down we just have to go up 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.570
 a little more the cat 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.630
 once we have all this out we 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 we fix how it is assembled and proceed to 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.549
 dismantle and replace the century in blog and 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.690
 the engine mount riding the same thing 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.690
 way they are before 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 and now we can only do the same 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.790
 process in reverse placing arm of 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.420
 motor with its Ã¶zil supports in block 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.849
 new 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.500
 if we have screw fixer 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.880
 we will put a little fixer in the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.580
 screws to prevent them from loosening 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.250
 the vibrations 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.890
 and we will reassemble the support 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.040
 switchboard and everything as it was 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.040
 at first
