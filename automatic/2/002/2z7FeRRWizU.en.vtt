00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.070
 well we're all here with Jason 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.710
 kreis and let's show you 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.719
 a little button that there is enough 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.100
 useful is worth and basically the gta denotes 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.250
 minions you know you can 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.010
 unintentionally throwing a spell on him 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 subject or sometimes you throw it wanting 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.910
 for the gypsy 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 but on another occasion you want to challenge the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.530
 champion and to the best 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 you have a somewhat strange angle I am 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.820
 champion and be here we could give it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.340
 even less so he could dominate without 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.370
 want when you want to give the champion 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.059
 Well, here is a very useful key 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.520
 and we have it here it says card only 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.880
 champions on the left button 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 of 1 if we keep that button pressed 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.410
 and we press the q we can not make 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.560
 spells to the champion 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.829
 so I ditch subjects I'm pressing the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.579
 cv and I can not do it 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.579
 Magic 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.400
 if you see it is very useful when 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.670
 you want not to fail in when it comes 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.670
 fail 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.670
 but you have to hold down the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.590
 button on the left of one at a time 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.590
 that you press the cv or whatever it is worth 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.300
 As you can see, it's going very well 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.610
 even the self- tankers we are 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.840
 Clicking right now is normal 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.040
 but now I keep pressing the button 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.500
 right the button on the left of 1 and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.540
 I can not touch you see there's no 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.230
 symbol attack symbol attack no and 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.230
 attack symbol 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.560
 Well, I hope you have been 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.260
 aid is quite useful on 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.390
 characters and with some more with others 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.720
 less for example with the anise w 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.070
 it's no use because it's an area but 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.600
 for example with its quota is if it serves 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 when they want to give the champion and not 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 they fail well this has been all life 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.459
 favorites if you had then congratulations 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.260
 If you did not know it, you already know what 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:18.100
 is what I like I was taught a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.100
 little bit more whenever they can and nothing 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.690
 look at her killed by white blows 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.550
 in order now
