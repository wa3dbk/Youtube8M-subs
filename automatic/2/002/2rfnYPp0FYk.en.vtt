to go swimming a lot and it stopped me

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.430 
to go swimming a lot and it stopped me
going<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.760> intimately<00:00:59.210> because<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.079> was<00:01:00.230> aware

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
going so intimately because I was aware

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.200 
going so intimately because I was aware
that<00:01:00.500> when<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:00.829> was<00:01:00.950> in<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.130> pool<00:01:01.310> maybe<00:01:01.940> people

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that when I was in the pool maybe people

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.760 
that when I was in the pool maybe people
didn't<00:01:02.540> notice<00:01:02.660> maybe<00:01:03.050> it<00:01:03.140> was<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.260> me<00:01:03.590> but

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
didn't notice maybe it was just me but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.380 
didn't notice maybe it was just me but
I'm<00:01:03.860> sure<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:04.430> people<00:01:04.729> would<00:01:04.909> be<00:01:05.000> looking<00:01:05.269> at

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
I'm sure that people would be looking at

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.700 
I'm sure that people would be looking at
me<00:01:05.540> because<00:01:05.840> they<00:01:05.960> could<00:01:05.990> see<00:01:06.110> my<00:01:06.439> scalp

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
me because they could see my scalp

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.819 
me because they could see my scalp
because<00:01:07.549> my<00:01:07.670> hair<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:07.880> wet<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:09.590> was<00:01:09.680> very

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
because my hair was wet and it was very

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.830 
because my hair was wet and it was very
obvious<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:10.790> couldn't<00:01:10.939> bear<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.509> be

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
obvious and I just couldn't bear to be

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.410 
obvious and I just couldn't bear to be
in<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.049> pool<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:13.520> stopped<00:01:13.759> swimming<00:01:13.939> as

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
in the pool and so I stopped swimming as

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.969 
in the pool and so I stopped swimming as
a<00:01:14.479> result<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.960> my<00:01:15.049> condition<00:01:15.819> also<00:01:17.979> sitting
