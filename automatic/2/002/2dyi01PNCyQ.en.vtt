00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:10.639
 Yes it is a building 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:14.830
 With the anger of on let's say doing tax receipt will be 23 talk 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.830
 After a review of it is yes Well 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:23.050
 I have been to 5 places before now 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:27.340
 The easiest recovery and the hardest black garden in the angry quest above 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.340
 And the second most difficult cabal and the next winter 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.820
 And there is with Bex 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.540
 It is very difficult in solo except for 5 places restoration of a child 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.730
 Since the roots of the recovery as a recommended if you do it solo 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.420
 I can't talk if I can't pull back some gum or something 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.920
 So we can re-draw I've reviewed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.790
 Kedomo sell towards the How do now? Well black garden 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.880
 If you have a mission started here please orbit home 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.310
 Video now 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:08.910
 I think I 'm back to the abandoned school Mitt 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.720
 The most disturbing part is the bounty and the anger of the queen of mission items 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.920
 received 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 You can get it , I think it is most important that it is not consumed 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.590
 This is not to consume the place where this is not and was confirmed in does not receive this quest 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
 Hmm 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.740
 We get between are redrawn This mission 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 As it turned out that it is consumed at the same time as clear , this is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 You can play it again as long as you don't get rid of it 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:40.200
 In Chapter 3 the place You're Yes Daneeto solo by Mawaseru up in catching the recovery if say confectionery to Aichi 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.130
 So we challenged the bar is and here is good 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.170
 By say pull back videos 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.270
 I would like to introduce you one more story 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.350
 I think there are items that are easy to get out and items that are hard to get out 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.640
 In the case of a big turn, the queen bird helm appears tremendously 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.260
 Huh 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.290
 Although it was about 4 times 5 times, it was just Queen Garder 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.280
 There was no separate product for the titer 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.550
 And now I 'm turning around with my friend but it was another friend 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.350
 And maybe it's recovery 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:23.650
 There are always two items that are easy to come out depending on the occupation 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 In the meanwhile there will be a lot of drawing and some other items will come out too much 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:32.569
 Without going to the quest to introduce by Tteyuu Ne Ja'm after recovery Marshall 5 days 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.890
 So what is the commentary Neville 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.890
 I 'm sorry
