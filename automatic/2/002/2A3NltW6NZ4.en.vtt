vehicle<00:00:35.660> mode<00:00:35.809> which<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.470> actually<00:00:36.590> like<00:00:36.920> about

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
vehicle mode which I actually like about

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.370 
vehicle mode which I actually like about
prime<00:00:37.489> because<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.540> said<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.780> don't<00:00:39.020> mind<00:00:39.260> them

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
prime because I said I don't mind them

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.740 
prime because I said I don't mind them
so<00:00:39.530> much<00:00:39.680> as<00:00:39.950> Autobot<00:00:40.850> logos<00:00:41.150> in<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.300> robot<00:00:41.570> mode

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
so much as Autobot logos in a robot mode

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.160 
so much as Autobot logos in a robot mode
but<00:00:42.410> they<00:00:42.470> just<00:00:42.620> seemed<00:00:42.920> unnecessarily<00:00:44.170> large

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
but they just seemed unnecessarily large

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.260 
but they just seemed unnecessarily large
in<00:00:45.680> relation<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.580> rest<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.910> vehicle

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
in relation to the rest of the vehicle

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.390 
in relation to the rest of the vehicle
mode<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.570> alt<00:00:47.720> mode<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:50.750> it<00:00:50.780> come<00:00:51.020> up<00:00:51.110> here<00:00:51.400> this

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
mode in alt mode so it come up here this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.440 
mode in alt mode so it come up here this
one<00:00:52.550> actually<00:00:52.610> takes<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> little<00:00:53.030> bit<00:00:53.150> of<00:00:53.240> doing

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
one actually takes a little bit of doing

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.380 
one actually takes a little bit of doing
you<00:00:53.510> gotta<00:00:53.660> get<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:55.060> legs<00:00:56.060> loose<00:00:56.390> here<00:00:56.810> I

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
you gotta get the legs loose here I

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.430 
you gotta get the legs loose here I
think<00:00:59.390> everything<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.870> kind<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.110> jams

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
think everything is kind of jams

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.960 
think everything is kind of jams
together<00:01:00.860> here<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:01.640> flip<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.030> windows<00:01:02.360> out

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
together here you flip the windows out

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.290 
together here you flip the windows out
pull<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.059> arms<00:01:05.390> get<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.410> hands-free<00:01:07.300> little

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
pull the arms get the hands-free little

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.350 
pull the arms get the hands-free little
split<00:01:09.220> down<00:01:10.220> under<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.490> sides<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.149> legs

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
split down under the sides and the legs

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.280 
split down under the sides and the legs
without<00:01:11.600> after<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:13.360> pin<00:01:14.360> them<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:15.229> the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
without after that pin them now the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.160 
without after that pin them now the
shoulders<00:01:15.740> come<00:01:15.920> down<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:17.479> arms<00:01:17.780> actually

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
shoulders come down the arms actually

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.650 
shoulders come down the arms actually
rotate<00:01:18.590> down<00:01:19.280> under<00:01:19.610> here<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:19.940> rotate<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
rotate down under here you rotate the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.710 
rotate down under here you rotate the
front<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> vehicle<00:01:21.530> forward<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
front of the vehicle forward and the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.360 
front of the vehicle forward and the
windows<00:01:26.990> come<00:01:27.170> up<00:01:27.229> here<00:01:27.470> now<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.010> windows

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
windows come up here now the windows

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.980 
windows come up here now the windows
actually<00:01:28.760> stick<00:01:29.000> out<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> side<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.780> here

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
actually stick out to the side on here

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.789 
actually stick out to the side on here
here<00:01:30.790> because<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.060> show<00:01:32.380> her<00:01:33.380> shoulder

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
here because in the show her shoulder

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.020 
here because in the show her shoulder
pads<00:01:34.010> are<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.220> quite<00:01:34.370> as<00:01:34.490> pronounced<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:34.940> she

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
pads are not quite as pronounced and she

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.700 
pads are not quite as pronounced and she
does<00:01:35.150> kind<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.360> have<00:01:35.450> door<00:01:35.750> wings<00:01:36.049> back<00:01:36.350> here

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
does kind of have door wings back here

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.680 
does kind of have door wings back here
and<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.490> they<00:01:37.760> represent<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.360> they're<00:01:38.570> on<00:01:38.659> a

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
and so they represent that they're on a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.289 
and so they represent that they're on a
hinge<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> they<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.430> close<00:01:40.610> up<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:40.970> vehicle

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
hinge so they can close up for vehicle

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.210 
hinge so they can close up for vehicle
mode<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.110> want<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.530> person<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:43.190> I

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
mode and if you want in person what I

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.070 
mode and if you want in person what I
think<00:01:43.520> despite<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.450> fact<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.750> she<00:01:44.840> does

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
think despite the fact that she does

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.500 
think despite the fact that she does
have<00:01:45.320> door<00:01:45.590> wings<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.340> her<00:01:46.520> cartoon<00:01:47.119> mode<00:01:47.330> I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
have door wings in her cartoon mode I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
have door wings in her cartoon mode I
think<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:47.900> looks<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> little<00:01:48.140> better<00:01:48.320> if<00:01:48.439> you

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
think it looks a little better if you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.500 
think it looks a little better if you
fold<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.830> doors<00:01:49.040> all<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> way<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.909> just

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
fold the doors all the way in and just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.539 
fold the doors all the way in and just
kind<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.750> give<00:01:50.960> her<00:01:50.990> for<00:01:51.890> your<00:01:52.010> shoulder<00:01:52.310> pads

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
kind of give her for your shoulder pads

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.850 
kind of give her for your shoulder pads
but<00:01:53.479> how<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.659> display<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.200> entirely<00:01:54.530> up<00:01:54.710> to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
but how you display is entirely up to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.240 
but how you display is entirely up to
you<00:01:54.979> also<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:55.880> note<00:01:55.909> she<00:01:56.510> does<00:01:56.720> have<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.470> know

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
you also of note she does have you know

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.929 
you also of note she does have you know
focus<00:01:58.880> here<00:02:00.010> she<00:02:01.010> just<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.280> faceplate<00:02:01.880> on

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
focus here she just have a faceplate on

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.999 
focus here she just have a faceplate on
this<00:02:02.270> head<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:03.200> I'm<00:02:03.350> not<00:02:03.530> sure<00:02:03.770> if<00:02:03.920> that's

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
this head and I'm not sure if that's

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.550 
this head and I'm not sure if that's
because<00:02:04.340> they<00:02:04.460> repurposed<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.390> prime<00:02:06.320> head

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
because they repurposed a prime head

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.810 
because they repurposed a prime head
looks<00:02:06.770> like<00:02:06.830> somebody<00:02:07.130> just<00:02:07.159> stuck<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> helmet

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
looks like somebody just stuck a helmet

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.060 
looks like somebody just stuck a helmet

so they had somebody to kind of face off
against<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.640> figured<00:03:24.910> well<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.150> I've<00:03:25.270> got

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.690 
against and I figured well if I've got
three<00:03:25.690> over<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> four<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.350> may<00:03:27.220> as<00:03:27.340> well<00:03:27.370> get

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
three over the four I may as well get

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.300 
three over the four I may as well get
the<00:03:27.850> fourth<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:30.000> yeah<00:03:31.000> she's<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.270> bad<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
then again quick size comparison who

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.910 
then again quick size comparison who
she's<00:03:35.170> with<00:03:35.290> Prime<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.890> Bumblebee<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.920> steel
