more<00:02:46.580> automatic<00:02:47.580> guns<00:02:48.380> I'd<00:02:49.380> say<00:02:49.650> pointment<00:02:50.220> is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
more automatic guns I'd say pointment is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.030 
more automatic guns I'd say pointment is
probably<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.200> SMG<00:02:52.200> related<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.890> know

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
probably the more SMG related you know

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.360 
probably the more SMG related you know
trying<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.920> use<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> lot<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.190> close<00:02:56.819> combat

rifleman<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.489> probably<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> happy<00:03:00.090> medium<00:03:00.650> it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
rifleman is probably the happy medium it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.550 
rifleman is probably the happy medium it
has<00:03:02.310> weapons<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.150> AK<00:03:03.569> stuff<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.350> be

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
has weapons like AK stuff that can be

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.220 
has weapons like AK stuff that can be
accurate<00:03:05.100> but<00:03:05.819> obviously<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.750> can't<00:03:07.019> use

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
accurate but obviously you can't use

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.180 
accurate but obviously you can't use
from<00:03:07.470> too<00:03:07.769> far<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.340> range<00:03:08.850> too<00:03:09.360> far<00:03:09.569> distance

people zooming in and far away one thing
I<00:03:21.000> did<00:03:21.180> realize<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.440> little<00:03:22.650> bit<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.859> time<00:03:22.980> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
I did realize and a little bit of time I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.000 
I did realize and a little bit of time I
have<00:03:23.310> played<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.000> game<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.480> uh<00:03:24.890> seems<00:03:25.890> like

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
have played this game is uh seems like

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.069 
have played this game is uh seems like
the<00:03:26.130> sniper<00:03:26.400> rifle<00:03:26.940> seems<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:27.959> be

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the sniper rifle seems that it can be

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.080 
the sniper rifle seems that it can be
used<00:03:29.510> even<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.810> mid<00:03:31.049> range<00:03:31.079> combat<00:03:32.090> sometimes

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
used even a mid range combat sometimes

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.729 
used even a mid range combat sometimes
it<00:03:33.329> seemed<00:03:33.660> it's<00:03:33.870> pretty<00:03:34.109> accurate<00:03:34.260> other

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it seemed it's pretty accurate other

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.349 
it seemed it's pretty accurate other
times<00:03:35.070> I'm<00:03:35.400> not<00:03:35.549> really<00:03:35.700> too<00:03:35.910> sure<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.239> to

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
times I'm not really too sure what to

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.440 
times I'm not really too sure what to
make<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.709> uh<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.880> said<00:03:38.910> earlier<00:03:39.060> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
make of it but uh as I said earlier you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.910 
make of it but uh as I said earlier you
can<00:03:39.630> buy<00:03:39.750> different<00:03:39.810> weapons<00:03:40.470> which<00:03:40.680> will

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
can buy different weapons which will

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.420 
can buy different weapons which will
have<00:03:41.190> different<00:03:41.489> accuracy<00:03:42.209> ratings<00:03:42.600> and

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
have different accuracy ratings and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.990 
have different accuracy ratings and
controllability<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.700> stuff<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.150> that

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
controllability and stuff like that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.440 
controllability and stuff like that
being<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.540> tactical<00:03:49.230> shooter

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
being that this is a tactical shooter

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.979 
being that this is a tactical shooter
and<00:03:50.920> basically<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.310> can<00:03:52.459> die<00:03:52.610> very<00:03:52.849> easily

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and basically you can die very easily

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.360 
and basically you can die very easily
couple<00:03:53.989> gunshots<00:03:54.730> especially<00:03:55.730> headshots<00:03:56.330> uh

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
couple gunshots especially headshots uh

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.490 
couple gunshots especially headshots uh
it<00:03:58.370> does<00:03:58.580> make<00:03:58.819> for<00:03:58.849> a<00:03:59.030> quick<00:03:59.239> death<00:03:59.500> that's

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
it does make for a quick death that's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.170 
it does make for a quick death that's
one<00:04:00.739> thing<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:01.069> did<00:04:01.220> not<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:01.519> about<00:04:01.550> this<00:04:01.940> game

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
one thing I did not like about this game

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.600 
one thing I did not like about this game
which<00:04:02.629> I<00:04:02.750> do<00:04:02.810> not<00:04:02.989> like<00:04:03.170> about<00:04:03.349> most<00:04:03.830> tactical

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
which I do not like about most tactical

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.170 
which I do not like about most tactical
shooters<00:04:04.910> is<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:06.200> fact<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.730> sometimes<00:04:07.730> it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
shooters is the fact that sometimes it

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.699 
shooters is the fact that sometimes it
can<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.480> first<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.620> sea<00:04:09.830> first<00:04:10.190> kill<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.709> since

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
can be first the sea first kill so since

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.420 
can be first the sea first kill so since
I<00:04:12.800> was<00:04:12.980> not<00:04:13.130> able<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.610> see<00:04:14.120> anything

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
I was not able to see anything

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.710 
I was not able to see anything
determining<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.549> ping<00:04:16.790> for<00:04:17.150> each<00:04:17.269> player<00:04:17.570> in

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
determining the ping for each player in

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.920 
determining the ping for each player in
the<00:04:17.810> game<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:19.669> where<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.850> doesn't<00:04:20.000> really<00:04:20.209> give

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the game so where it doesn't really give

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.879 
the game so where it doesn't really give
you<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.079> good<00:04:21.260> idea<00:04:21.290> of<00:04:23.139> what<00:04:24.139> server<00:04:24.440> or<00:04:24.710> what

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.650 
when i clicked it when i looked at the

which<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.990> thought<00:04:33.229> was<00:04:33.440> ping<00:04:33.740> but<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:34.880> guess

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
which I thought was ping but I guess

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.340 
which I thought was ping but I guess
it's<00:04:35.450> more<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:36.250> in<00:04:37.250> game<00:04:38.180> time<00:04:38.540> recorders<00:04:39.139> or

it's more of a in game time recorders or

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.140 
it's more of a in game time recorders or
