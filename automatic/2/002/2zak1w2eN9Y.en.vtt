 simple to make very simple that no 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.910
 There are so many things and that but there were 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.110
 because they have not yet brought the good in 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.450

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.300
 screw us to speak of this that l 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.290
 the inject and it's already there you have it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.630
 the hack does not have even half of things 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.930
 that the other but good for the moment 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.930

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 but as long as you give us 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 the web is not removed because it is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 holiday economic funds 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.850
 Well, it took this delay so much because 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.470
 I wanted to wait for the good 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.060
 but as they do not remove then while before 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.329

 no, it's not that 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.110
 It opens without slits and so it is much more 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.230
 easy 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.890
 the other 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.230

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.710
 Hello 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.340

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.000
 good morning we entered 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.420
 we have to play they kill me because I am 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 very clever 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.180
 barreiro with delay this is not the same 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.959
 because I am more 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.569
 the Nobel had life because I'm going to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.890
 kill 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.050
 but you can check what 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.690
 if we press for example what I squeeze 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.630
 I 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.120
 then he does not do magic and exploit the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.720
 bugs well 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.720
 all right 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:45.980
 but what is acceptable 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.510
 so when the good rises already better 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.380
 we speak in that order if you liked it 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.380
