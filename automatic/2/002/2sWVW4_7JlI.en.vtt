00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.370
 yes but piss 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.940
 justly 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.759
 us that we 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 football normally 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.269
 what better care from behind 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.179
 but talk about what what 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.380
 compact shortened ach gussie defended 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.519
 we could not easily find our wingers 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.529
 kibet who couldn't find it easily 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.800
 you have to make other choices 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 that he is not the right choice our members lose a lot of ball 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.150
 way too much back 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.860
 if you play back ten times 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.260
 plays on your keeper, it might go wrong again 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.500
 yes and that happened 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.290
 Yes then 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.720
 That's not that moment when you don't trust it well 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.210
 I did find that in that phase afterwards 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.400
 Peter started playing football 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.900
 still not 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.490
 on the basis of 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.070
 the sides actions and moves on 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.180
 the one against a tree 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.410
 our wingers had a lot of problems with their direct opponent 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.260
 just it 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.750
 but is crazy of course on the shot at the bar what can be a scary and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.770
 after another bad moment of course just before the break 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.500
 being punished from these kinds of mistakes and that kind of mistakes still means that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.650
 always with this team 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.010
 that there is also a piece of rest 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.430
 falls away 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.509
 that is very long fell still a number of moments that you see 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.390
 that is why cup was absolutely not an option for me to get away from the couch 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.740
 to play 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.149
 just to keep playing every case of ado nisation like this opens 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.370
 on to the connection goal 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.440
 well that had a lot of possession 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 very few can actually 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.680
 able to create 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 van den haag makes the assist on a 3 0 3 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.750
 played counter 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.689
 so yes we know in the beginning of the game we find ourselves on ourselves 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.359
 was partially played out of the match 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.400
 that was rightly punished 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.540
 and the rest of the competition was on a small vassaar 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.140
 as harelbeke and and we cannot bring what we actually wanted 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 also given the defeat at az 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.689
 Yes 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 that man founder of apple 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 you are welcome 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.719
 must say that the first to declare that VVV was good 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.919
 year that will be on the beach 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.959
 paid diplomats who play Libya 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.299
 hence everything his players trust 3 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.519
 that dare 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.519
 to make 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.729
 b 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.929
 advance booster 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.889
 the 88 wonderful plan rejected 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.409
 last year's success being seventh 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.560
 there you buy the team is brought together 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.779
 i say year 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.009
 I know you 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.559
 three crucial positions 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 you can imagine 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.049
 I think if I still look at the team with the 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.119
 to keep looking at the short-term acquisitions with such a call 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.179
 on 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.849
 but it's a few 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.939
 because performance when you are on 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.999
 the field of desire for work also brings too little 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.999
 I thought that was not tried until the last second 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.499
 saxo couch sat just too little one and 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.489
 I also stick with that 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.329
 especially the first two cols of course 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.329
 give away well if it's not easy then 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.290
 Those are absolute moments that will make you out of the ordinary 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:56.559
 plays a lost match 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.679
 when performance is 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.609
 if you don't work hard enough and I tried 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.709
 only a number of situations than that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.979
 that surprises me then 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.369
 couple dani fernandes with cabral time 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:11.469
 nevertheless will 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.469
 a lot and the momentum is wise in which the player 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.079
 the attacker wants to play in the feet while the attack wants a decent depth 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.150
 search without ball year 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.419
 the premium day and now that surprises me or that we are there 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.800
 making such poor choices and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.960
 in that respect I expected the us to be 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.590
 Let's hope the incident is over and that it will be back home in two weeks 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.090
 Which 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.470
 in that respect also in the football section and yopougon could be much better 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.470
 is 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.919
 7 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.800
 defeat project 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.280
 after a defeat 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.789
 arrives only you look at your own interpretation of your team 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.180
 and that is of course a defeat today that the otherwise as one 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.919
 defeat 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.680
 from last week 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.479
 but i like that 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.479
 the odds given away the first two calves 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.809
 we did not have the capacity to search for midfielders 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.669
 perceive and that also has to do with an opponent 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.499
 we are 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.889
 a team whatever it should look good from a good organization 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.779
 have to play 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:36.449
 And then you also see that in that respect you have problems getting round 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.229
 make the right choices to respond to midfielders 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.379
 as an outside player to take the ball out faster and 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.189
 with the distance with your right or left back 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.620
 because the double coverage a number of situation 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.389
 and still keep trying to make the promotion 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.870
 then that can't make it then figure out the other side 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.749
 yes that one can do much better 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.539
 you should not overdo myself with that, you must also compliment the opponent 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.309
 give contador has also just played very well 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:05.809
 since we were unable to take it 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:09.029
 to make amber choices on better choices 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.309
 plus the fact that I say you then 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.179
 so unbelievably wrong with two colcci adam then yes there is not 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:18.179
 more 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.430
 no I think that was also one 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.520
 the reason in peace you can also think 2 0 behind 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.009
 used or or midfielder out and the striker to extend 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.919
 nijkerk langkawi such as ensuring that we keep the organization a bit and 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.009
 and from there 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.399
 would come back in the law or make the n two one one two 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.949
 I also see that this team is not stuck because of the size of the banks 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:56.280
 He is so forth that it has been given away that this can be done much more and better 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.229
 play and 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.220
 anyway we have been those moments this plays less but yes but that 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:04.180
 the peacock also did not feel it 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.460
 that can be picked up before we can still come back in the game especially after the 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.740
 0 3
