 series in which I'm going to show you the 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.140
 best equipment that could be made to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.450
 throughout the generations of the lute 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.090
 first good officially that if 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.300
 come back like in 2009 but it was 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.540
 as a test so from 2010 to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.140
 this 2013 the best letters that have 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.080
 come out and from the best leagues this time 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.750
 I'm going to bring you the series in which 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.660
 we have the same goalkeeper Julio Caesar 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.810
 look 91 on average 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.970
 it was a porterazo that July caesar de fifa 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.820
 10 the defense of three on the right 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.570
 we have to look at what statistics 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.309
 produce after imagining that it is a 14 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.260
 for example 89 of the 82nd rhythm of 384 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 head is something tremendous for a central 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 it's 89 tremendous pace 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.880
 in the center Nesta have one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 authentic legend in your fifa card 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.050
 1176 of rates the right of weights and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.760
 head oils of a legend 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.040
 and on the left we have announcements from 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.860
 day by day also 82 back rhythm 87 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 defense and 85 head go are you for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.190
 announcements on that fifa 10 by the middle 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.650
 right we have the cifa crisis 12 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.530
 look at the tremendously good of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.330
 classic in 135 290 of rhythm 61 thorn 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 that helped a lot 78 I'll say that a 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 lie and I think I had four of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.870
 skills correct 900 like that but I think that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 I had four months left ix or the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.860
 left we have ronaldinho in his 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.450
 version of fifa 10 that was extreme 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 left 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.789
 and the milan 77 rhythm which is what most 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.119
 has had ronaldinho in his letters 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.840
 normal in all type 77 of pace 82 of 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.820
 step 85 coming to a 91 dribble was 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.860
 tremendous be ronaldinho from the pib to 10 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 the defensive midfielder is not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.350
 we have andrea pirlo from the cifa pilot 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 12 when totti in those times 72 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.950
 is 177 of 684 shot and that 95 pass 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.470
 90 average for pyrrho on the right 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.940
 we have the shift of marchisio I this 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.849
 player tested him the opposite is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 an authentic beast this player 82 of 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.650
 82 pace of shot 85 of pass in 934 of 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.140
 head 87 and also my mother marchisio 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.480
 in this very good 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 but also another legend in the cifa 10 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.310
 to the average 89 foot there we have it 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.459
 89 miles 79 89 of tremendous shot and it's 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.410
 that 84 of pass and 92 terrible 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.870
 Piero training and now I say 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.000
 we have the two beasts samuel eto'o 92 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.760
 86 shooting 89 immediately and they achieve the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.220
 great grand slam ibrahimovic pot and the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.510
 last year of fifa 12 is the best 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.480
 player that I have tried in this one of 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.660
 fifa I tried it when it was from play 3 in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 fifa 12 is eto'o and of ibrahimovic in that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 85 of pace 96 of shot 90 of pass 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.750
 90 head 93 of dreaming was the best 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.080
 game that I never tested of 6 bryant 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.340
 mobile totti then black here I leave you 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.380
 some interesting players too 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.860
 like for example the fool of fifa 10 that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.690
 I had look to see that being that 90 of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.740
 there were very good goalkeepers in the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.430
 series in 10 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:35.170
 both with and frei I was surprised to see the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.350
 of fifa 10 87 of for 2009 of reflections and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.030
 positioning ink and also 68 of 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.420
 speed we also have totti del 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.850
 fifa 10 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.970
 tremendous also totti 15 288 shooting 91 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.030
 of pass and risk 78 then we have to 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.540
 fifa 11 maicon also very good if 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.879
 maicon is the best maicon I think 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.950
 who has left then we have the 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.489
 Private toffees of how are thiago 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.519
 silva and di natale were the best version 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.829
 of them in all the fijas s thiago 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.390
 Silva was totally wonderful was 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.400
 magical 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.680
 just like I gave natale that any 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.730
 shot you have with the dragon and then 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.100

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.930

 This cavani here is always cavani 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.750
