00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 just enjoy the boxing that dredging 81m 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 that we did and here we go 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 teach you how to put the processor and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
 how to install the box safety cooler 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 intel has many people who are unsure 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 so I think it's cool to show here pro 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 how do you do here? 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.489
 correct processor 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.559
 Just like we're going to take this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.480
 black box here is not protecting 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.260
 the disk I know there for example is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 fingering here with something because 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.480
 the intel planters 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.149
 they are like this the way you are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.020
 Seeing then the pinning is on the plate 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.480
 not in it as is not leaving for example cpm 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 to know it's full of the pine here 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 right and it fits on the motherboard is here 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 different 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 the tires are on the motherboard and the contact 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.670
 it's done right 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the processor then the tires are 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.619
 insensitive sure is interesting 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 that becoming a pilot spoke 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:24.450
 We 're all going to come here, get up and look. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 that the pnad 1150 there you are seeing 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.360
 O processor 4445 here is cool 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 for games also their machines here 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:45.020
 nearby base 27 had caught and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.970
 base 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.740
 You come here and will fit 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 you will see that it will fit and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.009
 just like 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.009
 I showed there I think perfectly 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.610
 Let's see if you can get a dog here. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.180
 right 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.009
 and here on the other side the gift is small 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.459
 is trapped cute 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.450
 now how do you put that already 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.510
 is not protected. 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 more risk that we do in cash here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.160
 below for a zoom for you in box 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.120
 here fits in these re comes of the event 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.970
 was in the front box is here that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.959
 Come down and make a little noise. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.250
 half hard pulled aside and came back here 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.099
 You're ready, it's fine, it's no secret. 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.470
 Now it is properly placed 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.090
 cooler playbox from intel for those who do not 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.860
 You know the pleasure of box now come all 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.329
 line processors 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.370
 already 11 5055 only 2011 that has no cure already 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.400
 It comes with the paste to apply briefcase 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.530
 Quite cool, calm insurance. Here are the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.930
 boys is quite simple personal us 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.970
 will fit right will hit the fours 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.370
 to hit this right frame and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.400
 People are squeezing on the diagonals then 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.450
 we close here and if this is 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.900
 arrested cute involving 41 years 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:32.940
 fits these other 4 ac's motherboards 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:34.739
 sure that they cross the thread that the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.420
 people go in the mother's room after 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.100
 was is a current wire 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.510
 We get out of here then we 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.630
 You can fit the way you feel best. 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.000
 to stay an average time is cool then 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:54.530
 here's good to put 5 seconds to intel 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.530
 only as a base a good dusting 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:12.260
 and if that is the one and the that we will 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:14.940
 pressing now working was only 234 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.830
 points 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.750
 one more tight it will give a 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:26.210
 caught and looks like he went back now 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:31.110
 You see the white one it expands. 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:46.980
 white boy and black expands to come to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 to fit in here four was also 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.110
 stuck hanging out 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.280
 There is no secret, the staff is there. 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.640
 football is very calm, it's really to see 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.190
 I now realize that these four lines 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.650
 here you will turn left going 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.470
 turning by turning and pulling the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.480
 that you pressed that part 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.220
 plastic she showed behind him 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.200
 right up and pull to remove and replace your 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.050
 course is to replicate technical 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:32.310
 depends on what was the reason you 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:34.980
