00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
planted in circles where they will be

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.280 
planted in circles where they will be
planted<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.010> few<00:02:40.190> minutes<00:02:40.780> she's<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.900> circle

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
planted in a few minutes she's a circle

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.110 
planted in a few minutes she's a circle
and<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.920> one<00:02:43.130> only<00:02:43.280> three<00:02:43.400> because<00:02:43.819> these

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and this one only three because these

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.750 
and this one only three because these
are<00:02:44.299> ginormous<00:02:44.870> when<00:02:45.110> they<00:02:45.200> get<00:02:45.380> big<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.769> what

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
are ginormous when they get big and what

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
are ginormous when they get big and what
I'm<00:02:46.849> going<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.450> plant<00:02:47.930> power<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:49.220> our

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'm going to do is plant power that our

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.610 
I'm going to do is plant power that our
tomato<00:02:49.970> stakes<00:02:50.570> their<00:02:51.380> special<00:02:51.920> tomato<00:02:52.519> stick

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
tomato stakes their special tomato stick

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.830 
tomato stakes their special tomato stick
around<00:02:54.620> each<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.160> these<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.579> then<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:56.720> will

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
around each of these and then what will

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840 
around each of these and then what will
happen<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.709> vines<00:02:57.980> will<00:02:58.190> grow<00:02:58.220> right<00:02:58.609> up

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
happen is the vines will grow right up

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.890 
happen is the vines will grow right up
on<00:02:59.859> the<00:03:00.859> path<00:03:01.160> will<00:03:01.609> allow<00:03:01.850> me<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.209> go<00:03:02.390> right<00:03:02.690> in

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
on the path will allow me to go right in

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.300 
on the path will allow me to go right in
there<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.609> i<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.760> pick<00:03:05.120> vegetables<00:03:05.359> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
there so that i can pick vegetables and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.120 
there so that i can pick vegetables and
it<00:03:07.310> gets<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.790> most<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.569> day<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.890> why<00:03:10.069> this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
it gets on most of the day but why this

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.390 
it gets on most of the day but why this
isn't<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.670> real<00:03:11.090> experiment<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.840> because<00:03:12.400> these

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
isn't a real experiment is because these

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.220 
isn't a real experiment is because these
guys<00:03:13.609> are<00:03:13.670> planted<00:03:14.269> really<00:03:14.660> close<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.109> my

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
guys are planted really close to my

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.300 
guys are planted really close to my
water<00:03:15.470> source<00:03:15.859> this<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.970> rain<00:03:17.269> barrel<00:03:17.480> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
water source this is a rain barrel and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.729 
water source this is a rain barrel and
it<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.579> right<00:03:20.540> up<00:03:20.720> next<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.109> house<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.650> it

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
it is right up next to the house so it

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.440 
it is right up next to the house so it
gets<00:03:21.859> more<00:03:22.160> shade<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:22.670> I'm<00:03:22.790> not<00:03:22.940> sure<00:03:23.000> how<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
gets more shade so I'm not sure how the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.059 
gets more shade so I'm not sure how the
zucchinis<00:03:23.989> are<00:03:24.139> going<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.319> turn<00:03:24.440> out<00:03:24.620> good

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
zucchinis are going to turn out good

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.009 
zucchinis are going to turn out good
experiment<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.569> we're<00:03:26.690> going<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:26.900> fun

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
experiment so we're going to have fun

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.449 
experiment so we're going to have fun
and<00:03:27.319> check<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.650> out<00:03:29.769> okay<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:31.069> finished

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
and check it out okay we finished

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.379 
and check it out okay we finished
planting<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.329> path<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.910> see<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.180> allows

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
planting the path you can see it allows

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.210 
planting the path you can see it allows
me<00:03:35.420> access<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.530> water<00:03:38.829> here<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.980> see

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
me access to the water here you see

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.840 
me access to the water here you see
we've<00:03:40.639> planted<00:03:41.079> basil<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.639> rest<00:03:43.639> of<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
we've planted basil and the rest of the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.100 
we've planted basil and the rest of the
herb<00:03:44.030> garden<00:03:44.060> or<00:03:44.900> compared

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
herb garden or compared

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.620 
herb garden or compared
you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.690
