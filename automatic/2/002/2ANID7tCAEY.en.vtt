artists wits on the Left output and I'm
also<00:01:36.360> using<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.780> external<00:01:37.439> switch<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.610> I'm

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
also using the external switch so I'm

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
also using the external switch so I'm
able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> determine<00:01:40.079> which<00:01:40.380> channel<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.950> want

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.719 
able to determine which channel I want
to<00:01:41.310> use<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> amp<00:01:42.470> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> stereo<00:01:44.340> jack

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to use on the amp this is a stereo jack

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.359 
to use on the amp this is a stereo jack
that<00:01:45.090> goes<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.470> input<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.100> foot

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that goes into the input for the foot

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.240 
that goes into the input for the foot
switch<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> amp<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.250> ready

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

to<00:01:50.340> start<00:01:50.579> programming<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.869> octave<00:01:52.200> Suites

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to start programming the octave Suites

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.370 
to start programming the octave Suites
that's<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.369> first<00:01:53.549> preset<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.299> want<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that's my first preset I want to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.620 
that's my first preset I want to
controlled<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.700> dirty<00:01:56.969> rhythm<00:01:57.930> sound<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
controlled but dirty rhythm sound and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.969 
controlled but dirty rhythm sound and
for<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> use<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.680> command

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
for that I'm going to use the command

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.030 
for that I'm going to use the command
hot<00:02:02.369> drive<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.820> boost<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> hot<00:02:04.710> Drummond

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
hot drive and boost the hot Drummond

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
hot drive and boost the hot Drummond
boost<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.460> pedal<00:02:05.759> number<00:02:05.939> five<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.570> signal

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
boost is pedal number five in my signal

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.550 
boost is pedal number five in my signal
chain<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> simply<00:02:08.280> flick<00:02:11.180> number<00:02:12.180> five<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
chain so I simply flick number five here

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
chain so I simply flick number five here
with<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> small<00:02:13.920> screwdriver<00:02:14.209> I'm<00:02:15.209> some

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
with a small screwdriver I'm some

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.510 
with a small screwdriver I'm some
compression<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.410> well<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
compression on that as well that is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
compression on that as well that is
parallel<00:02:18.120> number<00:02:18.510> two<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:21.349> now<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.410> have

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
parallel number two here so now I have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.290 
parallel number two here so now I have
compressing<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.730> hot<00:02:23.880> driving<00:02:24.239> boost<00:02:24.450> on

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
compressing and hot driving boost on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.009 
compressing and hot driving boost on
this<00:02:27.300> preset<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.550> second<00:02:30.120> preset<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.690> want

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
this preset for my second preset I want

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.620 
this preset for my second preset I want
to<00:02:31.110> delete<00:02:31.440> sound<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.360> want<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to delete sound and for that I want to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.550 
to delete sound and for that I want to
use<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.489> plexi<00:02:35.489> tone<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.840> pedal<00:02:37.290> number

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
use the plexi tone that is pedal number

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.809 
use the plexi tone that is pedal number
three<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.370> my<00:02:38.760> chain<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.950> want<00:02:41.190> some<00:02:41.430> delay

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
