00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Welcome to the first video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 while the disco is still it is now 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.610
 just an hour around and it will be 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 much announced the word is one knew 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 says yes but accuse a lot 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.360
 epic staging the desire for more 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 and it is already world of warcraft 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.380
 warlords of prey only is official 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 revealed confirmed and you have too 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 cinematic what not really what and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.670
 ingame how do you say the ingame thing to him 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.309
 games internet ingame graphics rams 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.899
 seen that many many points, so to speak 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.860
 has addressed what will be new 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.350
 but I go first to the others 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.629
 things all harfst will open beta 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.399
 Start next month is too 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.079
 officially announced that means everyone 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.820
 the so far still no closed beta 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 did not get access to the cinema format 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 I rather had bad luck and I think so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.250
 that were some may from next 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 month the open beta was enjoy 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.649
 confirmed and then heroes of the storm 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.320
 was also still visible 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 Again, the cinematic of the actual 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 cinemaxx cinemagic the extremely brilliant 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.180
 Of course , pisa was typical only 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.950
 if most know and also ingame 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.229
 scenes and yes to ingame scenes 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 i say it's reminiscent of warcraft 3 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.520
 definitely the artwork it could be in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 warcraft 4 are naturally sees it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.600
 better still not powerful pure 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.420
 really old school moderately anyway 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.990
 it has the comic style of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.610
 warcraft 4 maybe who knows or 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 We just wanted to know each other in front of our strength 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.619
 we all love them or most of them 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.869
 love and she also knows that there will be 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 so also in the grande come see 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.439
 extremely awesome because of everything because 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 There are extremely many heroes out of all 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 There are many industry titles and I am there too 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.299
 looking forward bent on it 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 has also been officially confirmed 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.649
 that the beta's are open ups 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.560
 for heroes of the storm 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.530
 ie you can you up for the beta 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 register and hope that you get 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.610
 just software wow addon overrides yes how 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 said a real dementi gave you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.280
 seen there was not really 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.050
 as much information as you look at yourself 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.760
 would have liked and this information 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.240
 this gave it was relatively fast so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.330
 I have mine 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.710
 Sun realized what I have noticed me there 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.130
 One has for example seen that it 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.700
 nine 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.860
 that's new models for the breeds were 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.120
 but only for dwarves and orks that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.250
 only thing you have seen 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.310
 for the others for the other peoples 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.010
 you did not see anything and brokers could 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.720
 also not really exclude that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.490
 the others were also edited so 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.410
 there remains a carved hope that 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.890
 it also applies to the others too 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.660
 other classes and applies 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 There are various things you can do 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.260
 you have various things to do with your trainer 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.400
 I could not see yet 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.470
 all keep as I said the next 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.350
 Tag if I again videos on Mars 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 bring to the individual to the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.240
 single points from addon and drive 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.340
 give it back exactly there 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.450
 new battle battlefields or 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.010
 to fight me the most 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.200
 has already taken care of that in advance 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.520
 almost the last lettering a boost too 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.420
 90 so a bus to level to level 90 what 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.370
 so a bit of a split in me 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 triggers but okay there is anyway 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.450
 already has 95 characters is 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.740
 irrelevant and in this sense see 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.020
 we'll be even more at the weekend 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.660
 still measurable and surrounding the videos 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.290
