00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that and this is just like a casual

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.540 
that and this is just like a casual
comfortable<00:00:20.850> outfit<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.140> actually<00:00:22.550> have

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
comfortable outfit that I actually have

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.170 
comfortable outfit that I actually have
worn<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.410> variation<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.609> when<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.910> pregnant

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
worn a variation of when I was pregnant

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.849 
worn a variation of when I was pregnant
the<00:00:27.390> last<00:00:27.570> time<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> media<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.650> just

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the last time with the media it was just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.250 
the last time with the media it was just
with<00:00:28.949> different<00:00:28.980> genes<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.210> different<00:00:30.779> shoes

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
with different genes and different shoes

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.749 
with different genes and different shoes
I<00:00:31.410> think<00:00:31.439> because<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.369> summertime

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I think because it was like summertime

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.709 
I think because it was like summertime
so<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.680> plaid<00:00:35.399> shirt<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> got

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so this is just a plaid shirt that I got

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.000 
so this is just a plaid shirt that I got
from<00:00:37.230> Heaton's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.370> couple<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.149> years<00:00:39.390> ago<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
from Heaton's a couple of years ago and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
from Heaton's a couple of years ago and
I<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.540> maternity

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I really like this it's not maternity

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
I really like this it's not maternity
but<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:43.980> wear<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.160> open<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
but I can just wear it open with a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.470 
but I can just wear it open with a
maternity<00:00:45.930> t-shirt<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> still

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
maternity t-shirt and I think it still

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
maternity t-shirt and I think it still
looks<00:00:48.690> good<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.550> maternity<00:00:50.850> tini

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
looks good so this is a maternity tini
