00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and are there more English words that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.359

like<00:00:23.100> these<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.519> hand<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:24.060> tend<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.600> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
like these off hand we tend to think in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
like these off hand we tend to think in
terms<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> examples<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.920> assume<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
terms of examples and assume that the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
terms of examples and assume that the
more<00:00:26.699> examples<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.449> remember<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.140> more

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
more examples we can remember the more

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.679 
more examples we can remember the more
common<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.449> unfortunately<00:00:30.449> we

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
common thing is unfortunately we

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.269 
common thing is unfortunately we
remember<00:00:31.109> some<00:00:31.289> things<00:00:31.349> much<00:00:31.980> more<00:00:32.219> easily

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
remember some things much more easily

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.260 
remember some things much more easily
than<00:00:32.790> others

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
than others

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479

so<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.750> availability<00:00:34.559> heuristic<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:35.309> lead

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so this availability heuristic can lead

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
so this availability heuristic can lead
us<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> make<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.480> bad<00:00:36.630> assessments<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
us to make really bad assessments of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830 
us to make really bad assessments of
risk<00:00:37.550> things<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.120> commonly<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
risk things that are more commonly and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
risk things that are more commonly and
vividly<00:00:40.290> showing<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> media<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
vividly showing in the media like a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
vividly showing in the media like a
violent<00:00:42.480> murder<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> lot<00:00:43.860> easier<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
violent murder will be a lot easier to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
violent murder will be a lot easier to
remember<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:45.030> things<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.690> far<00:00:45.930> more

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
remember than things that are far more

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
remember than things that are far more
common<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.530> real<00:00:46.680> life<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.370> aren't<00:00:47.850> as

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
common in real life but aren't as

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690 
common in real life but aren't as
dramatic<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.469> cancer<00:00:50.010> patient<00:00:50.190> dying

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
dramatic like a cancer patient dying

peacefully at home likewise thinking of

things in familiar ways like

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
things in familiar ways like
alphabetical<00:00:55.890> order<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:56.789> easier<00:00:56.820> than

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
alphabetical order is a lot easier than

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
alphabetical order is a lot easier than
new<00:00:57.510> ways<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.989> third<00:00:58.410> letter<00:00:58.710> order<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.820> if

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
new ways like third letter order but if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.189 
new ways like third letter order but if
we<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.180> count<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> words<00:01:00.780> this

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
we actually count the words this
