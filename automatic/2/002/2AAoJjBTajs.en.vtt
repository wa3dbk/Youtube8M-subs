his public image he came across again
it's<00:02:48.209> very<00:02:48.390> cool<00:02:48.629> rational<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.769> command<00:02:50.310> of

the criticism of this package appears to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
the criticism of this package appears to
be<00:02:58.349> resonating<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.940> sales<00:03:00.180> job<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.720> not
