00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.260
 youtube friends this time we 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.060
 I bring a strawberry atole that I hope 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.529
 that like the ingredients that we are going 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.310
 to occupy are 2 cups of strawberry 1 cup of 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.400
 half a liter of water 4 tablespoons 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.670
 of corn starch a slit and a half of 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.950
 cinnamon an evaporated milk and a liter and 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.230
 milk medium in a container that 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 We will take the fire, we will place the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.810
 2 cups of strawberries already clean and without 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 rabito 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.410
 ah 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.640
 later we are going to add 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 the two cups of water or the half liter 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.820
 of water 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.090
 and we are going to add 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.430
 half of those in the sugar cup 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.750
 and we are going to add 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 the cinnamon and we're going to take it to the fire 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.380
 we 're going to leave it on medium heat 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.380
 about 5 to 6 minutes 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 well as next step in a cup of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 milk 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.260
 I'm going to add the 4 tablespoons of starch 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.260
 of corn 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.280
 and what I'm going to do is with the help of 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.910
 a balloon dissolve until I do not stay 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.910
 no chrome 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.230
 and once it has completely dissolved 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 the corn starch and there is no more 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.880
 group I will leave reserving this mixture 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.909
 after 5 minutes and since the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.450
 strawberries changed color 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.120
 and they release a very rich smell this 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.130
 let's put out the fire 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.560
 and we 're going to let it cool down for a few 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.140
 moments in what cool we're going to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.170
 place this milk in a container 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 that we are going to take to the fire and we are going to 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.790
 add evaporated milk right there 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.290
 and we are going to take them to very slow fire 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 so that it does not stick right once 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.670
 it's not so hot anymore what we're going 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.670
 to do is remove the cinnamon boxes 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.180
 and we are going to take them to liquefy 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 and since we liquefy what we're going to 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.609
 to do is to reserve it for a moment 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.760
 forget to be aware of the 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.620
 milk so that it is not going to stick 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.620
 you have to be constantly moving 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.950
 well once it's about to boil 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:04.879
 what we are going to do is add the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.879
 mixture of corn starch and milk 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.110
 and we will incorporate perfectly for 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.110
 later with the help of a colander 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.450
 we are going to 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.520
 pass our mix 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.520
 that we had liquefied strawberries 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.690
 and we add all the ingredients what 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.990
 what we are going to do is incorporate all 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.660
 all all in one mix and that's the 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.740
 has now that boils 5 minutes and 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.740
 it will be perfect 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.510
 well once it has already served the only thing that 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 you have to do is rectify the taste itself 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.260
 which is that you need a little bit of 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.120
 sugar in this case for my taste if I 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.730
 it takes a little bit of sugar and if 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.310
 you think it's perfect so 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.700
 so you can leave it and be ready to 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.130
 serve I hope you like them to vote 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.090
 that they comment that they subscribe 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.070
 and then nothing else is left to serve well 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.370
 And the only thing I did was serve garnish 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.900
 with a strawberry with a little sugar and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.300
 some cookies inmate and it's optional 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.460
 I hope you like the recipe that is 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.250
 encourage them to vote for you to comment 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.450
 subscribe and well if you dare to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.250
 do it and you want to share your 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.610
 results with us because there is the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.380
