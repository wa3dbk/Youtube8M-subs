vehicle it was coming from the rear and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
vehicle it was coming from the rear and
I<00:00:39.960> found<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> leak<00:00:40.470> quickly<00:00:40.650> but<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.370> going

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I found the leak quickly but I'm going

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.950 
I found the leak quickly but I'm going
to<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.150> whole<00:00:42.300> system<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.810> show

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to go through the whole system to show

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.300 
to go through the whole system to show
you<00:00:43.020> where<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.320> common<00:00:43.650> leak<00:00:43.800> points<00:00:44.130> are

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
you where the common leak points are

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.340 
you where the common leak points are
start<00:00:45.150> at<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.330> back<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.720> check<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.020> muffler

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
start at the back and check the muffler

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.080 
start at the back and check the muffler
body<00:00:46.560> for<00:00:46.800> leaks<00:00:46.980> especially<00:00:47.700> around<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
body for leaks especially around the

weld that's where the pipe joins the
muffler<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.630> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.200> pretty

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
muffler as you can see this is pretty

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
muffler as you can see this is pretty
nasty<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.310> leaking<00:00:56.690> anywhere

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
nasty but it's not leaking anywhere

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.970 
nasty but it's not leaking anywhere

first<00:01:13.229> thing<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.469> want<00:01:13.649> to<00:01:13.679> try<00:01:13.829> is<00:01:13.950> make<00:01:14.700> sure

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
first thing you want to try is make sure

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
first thing you want to try is make sure
that<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> nuts<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.429> tight<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that the nuts are tight and if that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
that the nuts are tight and if that
doesn't<00:01:19.649> solve<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:20.009> issue<00:01:20.359> you<00:01:21.359> have<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
doesn't solve the issue you have to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
doesn't solve the issue you have to
separate<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:23.039> two<00:01:23.219> pieces<00:01:23.609> of<00:01:23.640> pipe<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
separate the two pieces of pipe and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
separate the two pieces of pipe and
check<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:25.499> gasket<00:01:30.289> you<00:01:31.289> also<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> check

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
check the gasket you also want to check

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.039 
check the gasket you also want to check
the<00:01:32.310> mid<00:01:32.789> pipe

bit disintegrated that doesn't mean you

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.680
