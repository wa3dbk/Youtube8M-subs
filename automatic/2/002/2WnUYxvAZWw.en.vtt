00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello youtube friends as you see we are 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.630

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.400
 multiplayer we are with a friend 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.530

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.370
 description 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.470
 and well, here we have the mother 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.900
 the changes now want sheep but he 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.190
 president put cows and the one that did not get 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.530
 nothing good we have cows 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.880
 to our house 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.880
 we have our chests 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.370
 of the ovens 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.140
 but those of him 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.480
 for carriÃ³ we have what is a base 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.750
 of enchantments that we already built 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.300
 we have another chest 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.300
 another treasure chest of mine here 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.690
 and once the character is what we carry 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.000
 here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.370
 here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.730
 we built or rather in built a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.730
 trap 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 and a monster trap 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.229
 but I do not know what has happened up as broken 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.229
 I will go up to see what 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 and how many others up there 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.560
 extreme 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.330
 here 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.290
 is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.290
 and again 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 I'm going to upload it just to see 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.150
 how many we have but what is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.150
 sealed I think 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.049
 and good 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 that's what we carry so far not 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.250
 we carry something else 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:07.700
 without a cheat crystal giving themselves diamonds 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.700
 around here to the trees 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.410
 in the absence of this, you need to show them the 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.360
 door to the neder that we build here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.180
 but if I go I'm guided by the game if it's 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.180
 I'm going to go and well this video is going to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.910
 call showing our world a type 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 multiplayer and good simply one 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.050
 sample to create what we carry 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.770
 maybe we'll make a map with pixel 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.770
 deaf art in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.030
 and well, that's true, I hope that you 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.030
 I liked goodbye
