can use this as a hip extender but I'll
go<00:00:47.079> into<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.350> more<00:00:47.500> detail<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.130> a

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
go into the more detail and that a

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.190 
go into the more detail and that a
little<00:00:48.430> bit<00:00:48.550> later<00:00:48.670> just<00:00:49.180> clip<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.540> there<00:00:49.720> on

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
little bit later just clip that there on

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.710 
little bit later just clip that there on
the<00:00:50.410> sides<00:00:50.650> you've<00:00:50.890> got<00:00:51.070> your<00:00:51.190> traditional

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
the sides you've got your traditional

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
compression straps as well which are

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.860 
compression straps as well which are
nicely<00:00:54.130> clipped<00:00:54.550> as<00:00:54.700> well<00:00:54.880> so<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.090> can<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.540> you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
nicely clipped as well so you can it you

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.810 
nicely clipped as well so you can it you
know<00:00:55.989> that's<00:00:56.500> kind<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.770> where<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.010> +7<00:00:57.579> kind<00:00:57.760> of

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
know that's kind of where the +7 kind of

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.090 
know that's kind of where the +7 kind of
comes<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.180> too<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.450> you<00:00:58.570> can<00:00:58.810> extend<00:00:59.230> that<00:00:59.560> once

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
comes in too so you can extend that once

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.290 
comes in too so you can extend that once
your<00:01:00.250> gears<00:01:00.399> all<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.730> there<00:01:00.880> clip<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.270> place

your gears all in there clip it in place

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.790 
your gears all in there clip it in place
pull<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.110> then<00:01:02.260> that's<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:02.470> going<00:01:02.739> to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
pull it and then that's just going to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.979 
pull it and then that's just going to
draw<00:01:02.920> everything<00:01:03.220> into<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:04.360> on<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.629> front<00:01:04.809> as

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
draw everything into and on the front as

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.630 
draw everything into and on the front as
well<00:01:05.170> what<00:01:05.350> you'll<00:01:05.500> notice<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.370> you've

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
got your kind of your Daisy loops on

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.200 
got your kind of your Daisy loops on
there<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.560> hooking<00:01:09.220> additional<00:01:09.670> items<00:01:09.940> on<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
there so hooking additional items on the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.760 
there so hooking additional items on the
top<00:01:10.360> there<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.690> then<00:01:10.750> you've<00:01:11.229> got<00:01:11.409> your<00:01:11.500> ice

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
adjusters as well and they fit in nicely

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.670 
adjusters as well and they fit in nicely
within<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.450> loops<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.900> all<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.470> clip

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
within the loops and all the clip

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.260 
within the loops and all the clip
systems<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.520> are<00:01:18.610> on<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.790> bottom<00:01:18.970> section

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
systems that are on the bottom section

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.350 
systems that are on the bottom section
there<00:01:19.720> for<00:01:19.930> yep<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.710> let's<00:01:21.460> take<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> look<00:01:21.970> at<00:01:22.180> to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
there for yep so let's take a look at to

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.300 
there for yep so let's take a look at to
the<00:01:22.479> main<00:01:22.690> section<00:01:23.140> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> back<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:24.159> got

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
the main section of the back so you got

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.160 
the main section of the back so you got
your<00:01:24.430> traditional<00:01:24.610> clip<00:01:25.120> system<00:01:25.360> what's<00:01:25.900> also

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
your traditional clip system what's also

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.080 
your traditional clip system what's also
nice<00:01:26.440> about<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.100> does<00:01:27.250> have<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> roll<00:01:27.729> top

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
nice about this it does have a roll top

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.870
