back oh yeah that's the best part see if

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.580 
back oh yeah that's the best part see if
you<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.660> I'm

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.440 

noise<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:22.430> stout<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.880> knowing

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.010 

hours<00:00:26.450> of<00:00:26.480> hearing<00:00:26.930> those<00:00:27.050> circles<00:00:27.500> work<00:00:29.020> yeah

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
hours of hearing those circles work yeah

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.050 
hours of hearing those circles work yeah
w's<00:00:30.470> shouldn't<00:00:30.800> see<00:00:31.010> how<00:00:31.130> well<00:00:31.400> they<00:00:31.550> hold<00:00:31.850> up

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
w's shouldn't see how well they hold up

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:40.479 
w's shouldn't see how well they hold up
over<00:00:32.450> time<00:00:38.470> I'm<00:00:39.470> just<00:00:39.620> think<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.040> centering

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
over time I'm just think it's centering

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.490 
over time I'm just think it's centering
tool<00:00:40.760> all<00:00:41.830> 5.17<00:00:42.830> again<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:44.260> think<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.320> actually

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
tool all 5.17 again I think I actually

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.080 
tool all 5.17 again I think I actually
moved<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:45.950> forward<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:46.370> little<00:00:46.489> bit<00:00:46.580> so<00:00:46.910> there's

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
moved it forward a little bit so there's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.500 
moved it forward a little bit so there's
hope<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:49.580> my<00:00:49.730> average<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.270> little<00:00:50.510> shine<00:00:52.510> old

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
hope so my average a little shine old

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.689 
hope so my average a little shine old
there's<00:00:53.690> definitely<00:00:54.050> air<00:00:54.260> like<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.280> said<00:00:55.550> the

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
there's definitely air like I said the

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.630 
there's definitely air like I said the
grippers<00:00:56.060> are<00:00:56.300> not<00:00:56.600> yeah<00:00:57.310> anywhere<00:00:58.310> close<00:00:58.610> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
grippers are not yeah anywhere close to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.400 
grippers are not yeah anywhere close to
being<00:00:58.850> perfect<00:00:59.140> yeah<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.930> think<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.260> might

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
being perfect yeah so you think it might

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.469 
being perfect yeah so you think it might
have<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.770> right<00:01:03.980> have<00:01:04.670> had<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.119> right

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
have the right have had the right

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.410 
have the right have had the right
knowledge<00:01:05.720> each<00:01:06.050> time<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.619> was<00:01:06.740> just<00:01:07.060> air<00:01:08.060> in

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
knowledge each time it was just air in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.139 
knowledge each time it was just air in
the<00:01:08.570> positioning<00:01:09.170> yeah<00:01:09.770> okay<00:01:10.690> I'm<00:01:11.690> not<00:01:11.840> sure<00:01:11.899> I

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149
