00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
deck profile july / august 2015 and we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.270 
deck profile july / august 2015 and we
are<00:00:10.260> really<00:00:10.469> excited<00:00:10.679> about<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.190> because

are really excited about it because
people<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.670> been<00:00:11.759> asking<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.210> some<00:00:12.389> more

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
people have been asking to do some more

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.999 
people have been asking to do some more
competitive<00:00:13.110> deck<00:00:13.230> profiles<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.889> some

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
competitive deck profiles and get some

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.980 
competitive deck profiles and get some
more<00:00:14.070> deck<00:00:14.190> profiles<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.750> got

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
more deck profiles out there so we got

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.080 
more deck profiles out there so we got
the<00:00:16.080> stuff<00:00:16.260> volcanic<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.010> together<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the stuff volcanic that together and the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
the stuff volcanic that together and the
one<00:00:18.210> thing<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.750> preface<00:00:18.900> before<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
one thing I do want to preface before I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.630 
one thing I do want to preface before I
go<00:00:19.590> through<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.800> deck<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> actually

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
go through this deck is it is actually

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730 
go through this deck is it is actually
bends<00:00:21.000> deck<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.449> mine<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> fact<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
bends deck not mine so the fact that the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.170 
bends deck not mine so the fact that the
only<00:00:22.859> has<00:00:23.010> two<00:00:23.250> ultimate<00:00:23.580> rare<00:00:23.730> volcanic

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
only has two ultimate rare volcanic

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.420 
only has two ultimate rare volcanic
shells<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.750> gross<00:00:25.019> common<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.220> not

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
shells and one gross common one is not

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849 
shells and one gross common one is not
to<00:00:26.640> fall<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.090> shoulders<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.869> for<00:00:28.619> those<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to fall on my shoulders now for those of

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080 
to fall on my shoulders now for those of
you<00:00:28.949> familiar<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.369> volcanic<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:30.000> were

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you familiar with volcanic they were

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.310 
you familiar with volcanic they were
released<00:00:30.390> originally<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.900> force<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
released originally in force of the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
released originally in force of the
breaker<00:00:31.410> uh<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.759> minimal

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
breaker uh and they got some minimal

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.209 
breaker uh and they got some minimal
support<00:00:33.630> along<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.230> basically<00:00:34.890> all

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
support along the way but basically all

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.620 
support along the way but basically all
of<00:00:35.250> their<00:00:35.520> stuff<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:35.969> force<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> breaker

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of their stuff was in force the breaker

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
of their stuff was in force the breaker
until<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:37.590> tribal<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.129> except<00:00:38.430> blaze

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
until they got tribal is except blaze

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.639 
until they got tribal is except blaze

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.810 
accelerator reload rather in secret of
eternity<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> helped<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> deck

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
eternity which kind of helped the deck

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
eternity which kind of helped the deck
to<00:00:41.969> become<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.750> competitive<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.379> let's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to become actually competitive so let's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.410 
to become actually competitive so let's
go<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> deck<00:00:44.520> real<00:00:44.700> quick<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> I'll<00:00:45.270> talk

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
go to the deck real quick and I'll talk

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.459 
go to the deck real quick and I'll talk
about<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.750> stuff<00:00:45.840> along<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> way<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
about some stuff along the way that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.420 
about some stuff along the way that
needs<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.710> talked<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> don't

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
needs to be talked about but I don't

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
needs to be talked about but I don't
want<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> make<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:47.789> videos<00:00:47.879> too<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.539> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
want to make these videos too long so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
want to make these videos too long so
let's<00:00:49.200> jump<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.860> starting<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
let's jump right in starting with the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
let's jump right in starting with the
monsters<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> three<00:00:52.079> volcanic<00:00:52.710> rocket

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
monsters there are three volcanic rocket

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
monsters there are three volcanic rocket
now<00:00:53.520> volcanic<00:00:54.000> rocket<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.780> normal

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
now volcanic rocket is when it's normal

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
now volcanic rocket is when it's normal
summon<00:00:55.320> flip<00:00:55.530> summon<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.890> special<00:00:56.219> summon<00:00:56.399> you

can<00:00:56.579> add<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.820> blaze<00:00:57.059> accelerator<00:00:57.329> card<00:00:57.750> from

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
can add one blaze accelerator card from

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
can add one blaze accelerator card from
your<00:00:57.930> deck<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.289> graveyard<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.829> hands<00:00:59.160> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
your deck or graveyard to your hands so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.979 
your deck or graveyard to your hands so
you<00:00:59.760> don't<00:01:00.120> play<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> actual<00:01:00.809> blaze

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you don't play the actual blaze

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.479 
you don't play the actual blaze
accelerator<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> deck<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> trap

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
accelerator in the deck but the trap

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
accelerator in the deck but the trap
card<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:03.030> counts<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> try<00:01:04.199> blaze

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
card actually counts as a try blaze

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
card actually counts as a try blaze
accelerator<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.640> times<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.450> also

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
accelerator at all times and it's also

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
accelerator at all times and it's also
blaze<00:01:06.930> accelerator<00:01:07.229> reload<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.159> either<00:01:08.280> way

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
blaze accelerator reload so either way

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
blaze accelerator reload so either way
you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.760> search<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you can search it and it's one of the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.730 
you can search it and it's one of the
key<00:01:10.770> component<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> deck<00:01:11.430> plus<00:01:11.700> rockets<00:01:12.150> 1900

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
key component to deck plus rockets 1900

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
key component to deck plus rockets 1900
so<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:13.979> around<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:15.240> effective

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
so it's all around really effective

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
so it's all around really effective
three<00:01:16.530> royal<00:01:16.770> fire<00:01:17.100> storm<00:01:17.400> grunts

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
three royal fire storm grunts

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.800 
three royal fire storm grunts
unfortunately<00:01:18.090> only<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
unfortunately only one of these are

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
unfortunately only one of these are
secret<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
secret at the time this is when the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
secret at the time this is when the
Scottish<00:01:20.640> normal<00:01:20.880> sounds<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.270> for

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Scottish normal sounds like for

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
Scottish normal sounds like for
pyro-type<00:01:21.780> monsters<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.530> grade<00:01:22.830> bed

return those cars to the deck then draw

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730 
return those cars to the deck then draw
two<00:01:24.330> cards<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> pot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> avarice

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
two cards so it's like a pot of avarice

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.260 
two cards so it's like a pot of avarice
but<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> allows<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> recycle<00:01:27.240> your

because of blades accelerator reload and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.780 
because of blades accelerator reload and
then<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.020> three<00:01:58.740> volcanic<00:01:59.490> shells

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
then there are three volcanic shells

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.170 
then there are three volcanic shells
these<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:00.990> again<00:02:01.740> targets<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.700> blaze<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.119> to

these are again targets for blaze how to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999 
these are again targets for blaze how to
reload<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.840> also<00:02:04.020> pyro<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> pay

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
reload it's also pyro and you can pay

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
reload it's also pyro and you can pay

to<00:02:07.110> add<00:02:07.320> another<00:02:07.890> copy<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.670> neck<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
to add another copy of it from neck to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.520 
to add another copy of it from neck to
your<00:02:08.940> hand<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.330> uh<00:02:09.599> there's<00:02:10.229> plenty<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
your hand so uh there's plenty of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
your hand so uh there's plenty of
consistency<00:02:11.129> there's<00:02:11.310> plenty<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.520> draw<00:02:11.790> power

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
consistency there's plenty of draw power

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
consistency there's plenty of draw power
and<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.360> course

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and of course

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
and of course
really<00:02:13.680> brings<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> heat<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.090> have

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
really brings the heat and then we have

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.090 
really brings the heat and then we have
one<00:02:15.420> volcanic<00:02:15.960> counter<00:02:16.230> which<00:02:16.380> more<00:02:17.070> than

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
one volcanic counter which more than

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.590 
one volcanic counter which more than
likely<00:02:17.250> will<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.640> bumped<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> two<00:02:18.300> because

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
likely will be bumped up to two because

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.360 
likely will be bumped up to two because
it<00:02:18.720> seems<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.140> better<00:02:19.320> at<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.860> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
it seems like it's better at two this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.130 
it seems like it's better at two this
one<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.150> course<00:02:21.270> pyro<00:02:21.570> when<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
one is of course pyro when it's in the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
one is of course pyro when it's in the
graveyard<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> take<00:02:22.800> damage<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.490> can

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
graveyard and you take damage you can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.310 
graveyard and you take damage you can
bet<00:02:23.850> oh<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.510> banish<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.900> rather<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
bet oh you have to banish it rather and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.690 
bet oh you have to banish it rather and
your<00:02:25.650> opponent<00:02:25.800> takes<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> same<00:02:26.340> amount<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
your opponent takes the same amount of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.460 
your opponent takes the same amount of
damage<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.350> we're

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
damage that you do and right now we're

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.660 
damage that you do and right now we're
playing<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.830> somebody<00:02:29.130> wrong<00:02:29.250> still<00:02:29.490> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
playing one somebody wrong still but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.070 
playing one somebody wrong still but
this<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> lot<00:02:30.060> more<00:02:30.180> effective<00:02:30.630> when<00:02:30.810> lava

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
this was a lot more effective when lava

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.110 
this was a lot more effective when lava
ball<00:02:31.320> chain<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.680> still<00:02:31.890> legal<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:32.880> could

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
ball chain was still legal so you could

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.060 
ball chain was still legal so you could
get<00:02:33.270> volcanic<00:02:34.080> rock<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.740> then<00:02:34.830> dump

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
get volcanic rock it out and then dump

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.010 
get volcanic rock it out and then dump
stuff<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.490> really<00:02:35.730> set<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.000> your<00:02:36.090> plays<00:02:36.300> we're

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
stuff to really set up your plays we're

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.180 
stuff to really set up your plays we're
probably<00:02:37.170> gonna<00:02:37.350> drop<00:02:37.530> someone<00:02:37.770> among<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
probably gonna drop someone among for a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.890 
probably gonna drop someone among for a
volcanic<00:02:38.520> counter<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.330> running<00:02:39.540> two<00:02:39.750> of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
volcanic counter because running two of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.170 
volcanic counter because running two of
them<00:02:40.050> seems<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> more<00:02:40.620> effective

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
them seems like a more effective

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.960 
them seems like a more effective
strategy<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.420> point<00:02:42.860> for<00:02:43.860> spells<00:02:44.250> we

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
strategy at this point for spells we

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.420 
strategy at this point for spells we
have<00:02:45.150> 30<00:02:45.690> pot<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.050> duality<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.830> don't<00:02:47.160> really

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
have 30 pot of duality you don't really

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.800 
have 30 pot of duality you don't really
ever<00:02:47.580> special<00:02:48.000> summon<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.450> deck<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.750> if

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
ever special summon in this deck and if

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.840 
ever special summon in this deck and if
you<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.050> it's<00:02:49.230> very<00:02:49.290> rare<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.130> duality<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.700> just

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
you do it's very rare so duality is just

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.100 
you do it's very rare so duality is just
a<00:02:50.910> consistency<00:02:51.480> booster<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> lets<00:02:52.020> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
a consistency booster that lets you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.560 
a consistency booster that lets you
search<00:02:52.350> out<00:02:52.500> your<00:02:52.650> stuff<00:02:52.830> faster<00:02:53.310> uh<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:54.450> have

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
search out your stuff faster uh we have

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.530 
search out your stuff faster uh we have
two<00:02:55.470> magic<00:02:55.950> planter<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.760> send<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.270> face-up

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
two magic planter this send one face-up

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.480 
two magic planter this send one face-up
continuous<00:02:58.140> trap<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.500> graveyard<00:02:58.710> on<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
continuous trap on the graveyard on the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.070 
continuous trap on the graveyard on the
field<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.850> Graveyard<00:03:00.240> draw<00:03:00.510> two<00:03:00.660> cards<00:03:00.840> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
field to the Graveyard draw two cards so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.910 
field to the Graveyard draw two cards so
this<00:03:01.230> works<00:03:01.440> with<00:03:01.670> fetus<00:03:02.670> chain<00:03:02.940> mistake

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
this works with fetus chain mistake

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.080 
this works with fetus chain mistake
blades<00:03:04.920> accelerator<00:03:05.340> reload<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.910> think

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
blades accelerator reload and I think

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.160 
blades accelerator reload and I think
there<00:03:06.180> might<00:03:06.270> be<00:03:06.330> another<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.900> there<00:03:07.020> that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
there might be another one in there that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
there might be another one in there that
I'm<00:03:07.260> drawing<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.530> blank<00:03:07.740> on<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.610> overall<00:03:08.640> it's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
I'm drawing a blank on but overall it's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.340 
I'm drawing a blank on but overall it's
a<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.150> good<00:03:09.420> card<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.870> add<00:03:09.960> some<00:03:10.170> draw

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
a really good card that add some draw

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.310 
a really good card that add some draw
power<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.800> deck<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:11.940> think<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.450> ghost<00:03:13.050> in

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
power of the deck and I think a ghost in

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.810 
power of the deck and I think a ghost in
the<00:03:13.380> room<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.740> told<00:03:13.890> me<00:03:14.010> vanities<00:03:14.400> emptiness

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
the room just told me vanities emptiness

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.780 
the room just told me vanities emptiness
also<00:03:15.270> works<00:03:16.020> for<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:16.680> all<00:03:17.250> sorts<00:03:17.670> of

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
also works for that so all sorts of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.760 
also works for that so all sorts of
combos<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.300> use<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> magic<00:03:18.660> planter<00:03:19.140> that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
combos you can use a magic planter that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.930 
combos you can use a magic planter that
really<00:03:19.920> enable<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.370> keep<00:03:20.760> some

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
really enable you to keep some

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.670 
really enable you to keep some
consistency<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.480> your<00:03:21.540> hands<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.870> course<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
consistency in your hands of course to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560 
consistency in your hands of course to
MST<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.760> only<00:03:23.910> thing<00:03:24.060> that's<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.300> really

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
MST the only thing that's that really

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
MST the only thing that's that really
worries<00:03:24.750> about<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.170> dimensional

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
worries about is like dimensional

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.530 
worries about is like dimensional
fissure<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.830> macro<00:03:26.190> cosmos<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.390> is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
fissure and macro cosmos but it is

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.880 
fissure and macro cosmos but it is
obviously<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.080> devastating<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.709> deck

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
obviously really devastating to the deck

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.470 
obviously really devastating to the deck
so<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> want<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.520> bounce<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.390> you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
so you want to have bounce to it but you

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
so you want to have bounce to it but you
don't<00:03:30.630> need<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.750> mean<00:03:30.990> three<00:03:31.260> MST<00:03:31.709> or<00:03:31.860> anything

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
don't need to mean three MST or anything

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.440 
don't need to mean three MST or anything
like<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.340> because<00:03:32.640> you're<00:03:33.060> pretty<00:03:33.240> good

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
like that because you're pretty good

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.320 
like that because you're pretty good
with<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:34.050> what<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> have<00:03:34.760> one<00:03:35.760> wildfire

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
with with what you have one wildfire

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.550 
with with what you have one wildfire
which<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.690> essentially<00:03:36.990> actually<00:03:37.410> just

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
which is essentially actually just

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.900 
which is essentially actually just
another<00:03:37.770> copy<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.160> dark<00:03:38.370> hole<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.790> can

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
another copy of dark hole but you can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.160 
another copy of dark hole but you can
only<00:03:38.970> activate<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> place

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
only activate it when you have a place

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.110 
only activate it when you have a place
accelerator<00:03:40.709> card<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.070> field<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.970> in

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
accelerator card on the field so in

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.250 
accelerator card on the field so in
nooks<00:03:42.300> all<00:03:42.420> monsters<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> field<00:03:42.900> it's<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
nooks all monsters on the field it's a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.300 
nooks all monsters on the field it's a
quick<00:03:43.410> play<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.830> then<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.010> summon<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
quick play and then you summon a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
quick play and then you summon a
wildfire<00:03:44.790> token<00:03:45.209> with<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.390> thousand<00:03:45.750> attack

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
wildfire token with a thousand attack

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
wildfire token with a thousand attack
points<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.800> it<00:03:46.950> basically<00:03:47.040> just<00:03:47.430> keeps<00:03:47.670> you

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
points so it basically just keeps you

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.920 
points so it basically just keeps you
another<00:03:47.970> way<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> clear<00:03:48.330> your<00:03:48.480> opponent's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
another way to clear your opponent's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.810 
another way to clear your opponent's
field<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.190> never<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.730> have

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
field and you know you never really have

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.310 
field and you know you never really have
a<00:03:50.880> lot<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.090> monsters<00:03:51.450> out<00:03:51.570> anyway<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.200> not

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
a lot of monsters out anyway so it's not

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.170 
a lot of monsters out anyway so it's not
something<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.620> have<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.800> worry<00:03:52.860> about<00:03:53.180> one

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
something you have to worry about one

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.750 
something you have to worry about one
foolish<00:03:54.480> burial<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.739> dark<00:03:55.980> hole<00:03:56.250> because

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
foolish burial one dark hole because

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.979 
foolish burial one dark hole because
again<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.270> wildfires<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.840> don't

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
again you have the wildfires you don't

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.140 
again you have the wildfires you don't
really<00:03:58.080> need<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.470> one<00:03:59.070> reg<00:03:59.250> ecchi<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.820> that's

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
really need to one reg ecchi and that's

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.120 
really need to one reg ecchi and that's
going<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.959> spells<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.500> couple

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
going to do it for the spells a couple

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.440 
going to do it for the spells a couple
noticeable<00:04:02.670> things<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.060> may<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.209> missing

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
noticeable things that may be missing

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.060 
noticeable things that may be missing
from<00:04:03.630> here<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.020> book<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.260> moon<00:04:04.440> it

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
from here be like book of moon it

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.199 
from here be like book of moon it
doesn't<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.850> really<00:04:06.090> necessary

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209

doesn't really it's not really necessary
in<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.900> build<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.320> don't<00:04:07.470> have<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> lot<00:04:07.980> of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
in the build you don't have a lot of

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.229 
in the build you don't have a lot of
monsters<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.790> get<00:04:08.970> over<00:04:09.120> your

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
about too much so that's basically just

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.760 
about too much so that's basically just
not<00:04:15.239> necessary<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.380> what<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.650> got

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
not necessary but with what you got

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.199 
not necessary but with what you got
there<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:16.980> good<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.370> could<00:04:17.520> test<00:04:17.790> out<00:04:18.000> you

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
there it's good you could test out you

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.400 
there it's good you could test out you
know<00:04:18.330> if<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.510> wanted<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> play<00:04:18.840> too<00:04:19.049> dark<00:04:19.230> hole

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.990 
know if you wanted to play too dark hole
you<00:04:19.590> could<00:04:19.799> instead<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.220> wildfire<00:04:20.669> because<00:04:20.910> it

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
you could instead a wildfire because it

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.400 
you could instead a wildfire because it
can<00:04:21.150> dead<00:04:21.330> draw<00:04:21.539> sometimes<00:04:21.930> being<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.229> quick

can dead draw sometimes being a quick
play<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.680> pretty<00:04:22.860> helpful<00:04:23.100> all<00:04:23.910> things

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
play is pretty helpful all things

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.600 
play is pretty helpful all things
considered<00:04:24.919> alright<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.100> for<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
considered alright and for the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.580 
considered alright and for the
traps<00:04:26.939> triple<00:04:27.689> blades<00:04:27.900> accelerator<00:04:28.319> reload

so this is the one I was talking about

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.790 
so this is the one I was talking about
its<00:04:30.449> name<00:04:30.659> becomes<00:04:30.930> try<00:04:31.139> bleeds<00:04:31.379> accelerator

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
its name becomes try bleeds accelerator

you can discard one volcanic card draw
one<00:04:36.569> card<00:04:36.599> and<00:04:37.050> then<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.319> course<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:38.460> can<00:04:38.610> use

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
one card and then of course you can use

the effect of leads accelerator once per
turn<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.500> then<00:04:40.620> during<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.979> main<00:04:41.159> phase<00:04:41.370> if

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
turn and then during the main phase if

obviously a slower card then its

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
really well because it's chainable and

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.189 
really well because it's chainable and

we don't have a second copy of it at the

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
the hand mistaken arrest which comes out

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.450 
the hand mistaken arrest which comes out
in<00:06:00.750> class<00:06:00.870> rebellions<00:06:01.500> it's<00:06:02.069> also<00:06:02.219> another

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
in class rebellions it's also another

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.860 
in class rebellions it's also another
cool<00:06:02.669> car<00:06:02.879> but<00:06:02.909> it's<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.210> a<00:06:03.240> continuous<00:06:03.659> trap

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
cool car but it's not a continuous trap

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.269 
cool car but it's not a continuous trap
so<00:06:04.050> it's<00:06:04.139> not<00:06:04.259> really<00:06:04.469> worth<00:06:04.620> playing<00:06:04.889> in<00:06:05.099> here

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:05.279 
so it's not really worth playing in here

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.390 
always have a complete extra deck
because<00:06:47.349> you'd<00:06:47.469> ever<00:06:47.560> know<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:48.159> can<00:06:48.279> pretty

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
because you'd ever know you can pretty

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.709 
because you'd ever know you can pretty
much<00:06:48.460> put<00:06:48.669> whatever<00:06:48.849> rank<00:06:49.090> forward<00:06:49.389> you<00:06:49.479> wants

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
much put whatever rank forward you wants

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.989 
much put whatever rank forward you wants
you<00:06:49.810> in<00:06:49.960> there<00:06:50.199> but<00:06:51.129> the<00:06:51.520> deck<00:06:51.699> is<00:06:51.849> just

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:51.999 
you in there but the deck is just

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.219 
you in there but the deck is just
consistent<00:06:52.419> enough<00:06:52.539> on<00:06:52.689> it's<00:06:52.840> only<00:06:52.960> you<00:06:53.110> don't

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
consistent enough on it's only you don't

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.209 
consistent enough on it's only you don't
really<00:06:53.319> need<00:06:53.469> to<00:06:53.560> do<00:06:53.680> that<00:06:53.710> you<00:06:53.919> just<00:06:54.039> play<00:06:54.189> a

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
really need to do that you just play a

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.309 
really need to do that you just play a
control<00:06:54.580> game<00:06:54.759> so<00:06:54.999> honestly<00:06:55.870> it's<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.110> really

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
control game so honestly it's a really

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.869 
control game so honestly it's a really
fun<00:06:56.590> deck<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:56.979> it's<00:06:57.099> a<00:06:57.159> powerful<00:06:57.460> back<00:06:57.699> I

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
fun deck and it's a powerful back I

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.369 
fun deck and it's a powerful back I
think<00:06:58.120> it's<00:06:58.240> got<00:06:58.389> a<00:06:58.419> good<00:06:58.599> shot<00:06:58.629> to<00:06:58.900> win<00:06:58.990> worlds

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
think it's got a good shot to win worlds

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.809 
think it's got a good shot to win worlds
just<00:06:59.590> because<00:06:59.860> it's<00:07:00.219> one<00:07:00.340> of<00:07:00.400> the<00:07:00.460> few<00:07:00.580> decks

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
just because it's one of the few decks

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.719 
just because it's one of the few decks
where<00:07:00.999> stuff<00:07:01.659> is<00:07:01.779> legal<00:07:02.199> in<00:07:02.319> both<00:07:02.529> ocg<00:07:03.099> and<00:07:03.249> TCG

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
where stuff is legal in both ocg and TCG

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.100 
where stuff is legal in both ocg and TCG
so<00:07:03.879> there's<00:07:04.060> a<00:07:04.120> chance<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.449> might<00:07:04.569> actually<00:07:04.749> do

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
so there's a chance it might actually do

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.559 
so there's a chance it might actually do
something<00:07:05.789> but<00:07:06.789> yeah<00:07:07.210> that's<00:07:07.449> basically

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:07.569 
something but yeah that's basically

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.239 
something but yeah that's basically
volcanics<00:07:08.289> pretty<00:07:08.499> simple<00:07:08.800> that<00:07:08.919> but<00:07:09.069> it's<00:07:09.189> a

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:09.249 
volcanics pretty simple that but it's a

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:10.619 
volcanics pretty simple that but it's a
lot<00:07:09.370> of<00:07:09.400> fun<00:07:09.490> and<00:07:09.729> it's<00:07:09.849> deck<00:07:10.029> that<00:07:10.180> really

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:10.629 
lot of fun and it's deck that really

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:13.950 
lot of fun and it's deck that really
really<00:07:11.379> brings<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:11.740> firepower<00:07:12.189> um<00:07:12.460> and<00:07:13.150> just

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
really brings the firepower um and just

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.179 
really brings the firepower um and just
