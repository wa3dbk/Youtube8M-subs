00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
down conceptually you know it happens

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.520 
down conceptually you know it happens
but<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.690> doesn't<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:33.990> alter<00:01:34.410> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
but it doesn't like alter your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
but it doesn't like alter your
perception<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.220> game<00:01:35.400> until<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:35.940> go<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
perception of the game until you go on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.520 
perception of the game until you go on
the<00:01:36.360> wall<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.810> sometimes<00:01:37.170> you're<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the wall but sometimes you're on the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.660 
the wall but sometimes you're on the
wall<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> feels<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.370> you're<00:01:38.550> actually

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
wall and it feels like you're actually

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
wall and it feels like you're actually
sideways<00:01:39.330> on<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.540> wall<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.050> that's<00:01:40.260> actually

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
sideways on the wall and that's actually

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.840 
sideways on the wall and that's actually
really<00:01:40.860> cool<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.370> can<00:01:41.400> feel<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
really cool when you can feel like

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.610 
really cool when you can feel like
you're<00:01:42.060> defying<00:01:42.450> gravity<00:01:43.080> that's<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
you're defying gravity that's when the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.530 
you're defying gravity that's when the
game<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:43.830> starts<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.730> know<00:01:44.850> becoming

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
game actually starts you know becoming

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
relevant and the fact that you can defy

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.140 
relevant and the fact that you can defy
gravity<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> levels<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.120> going

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150

through<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.690> airport<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.230> like<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.590> have

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
through an airport I was like to have

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
through an airport I was like to have

guess and you could write karts through

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.190 
guess and you could write karts through
its<00:01:52.980> pre<00:01:53.670> 9/11<00:01:53.970> Mushroom<00:01:54.600> Kingdom<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.050> there

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.289 
that cart in those wheels that's
different<00:02:26.010> play<00:02:26.220> Mario<00:02:26.580> Kart<00:02:26.640> how<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> want

to play it that's the point of it really

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.050 
to play it that's the point of it really
the<00:02:28.830> game<00:02:28.980> does<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.280> part<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.640> even<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the game does this part to even out the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.089 
the game does this part to even out the
score<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.019> have<00:02:31.230> heard<00:02:31.530> whispers

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
score for you to I have heard whispers

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.039 
score for you to I have heard whispers
only<00:02:32.400> whispers<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.269> little<00:02:33.510> sound<00:02:33.750> box

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
only whispers that little sound box

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.750 
only whispers that little sound box
thing<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.290> used<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> once<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.190> blasted

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
thing I used it once it's like blasted

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.009 
thing I used it once it's like blasted
everyone<00:02:36.060> around<00:02:36.269> me<00:02:36.390> I'll<00:02:36.480> say<00:02:36.599> oh<00:02:36.629> that's<00:02:36.810> me

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
everyone around me I'll say oh that's me

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.930 
everyone around me I'll say oh that's me
but<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> guess<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.799> totally<00:02:38.010> negate<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
but I guess it can totally negate the

racing<00:04:07.859> but<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:08.340> did<00:04:08.549> what<00:04:08.699> this<00:04:08.879> one<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
racing but they did what this one is

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.879 
racing but they did what this one is
they<00:04:09.359> divided<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.930> entire<00:04:10.290> track<00:04:10.620> into

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
they divided the entire track into

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.890 
they divided the entire track into
ultimately<00:04:11.220> three<00:04:11.489> sections<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.269> go<00:04:12.599> and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
ultimately three sections so you go and

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.909 
ultimately three sections so you go and
then<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.049> pass<00:04:13.230> section<00:04:13.560> one<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:13.889> like

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
then you pass section one it's like

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.409 
then you pass section one it's like
alright<00:04:14.220> now<00:04:14.400> as<00:04:14.519> your<00:04:14.669> second<00:04:15.000> Lam<00:04:15.120> right<00:04:15.329> now

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419

alright now as your second Lam right now
it's<00:04:15.569> your<00:04:15.660> third<00:04:15.840> lap<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.650> one

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
it's your third lap so really it's one

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.740 
it's your third lap so really it's one
third<00:04:17.220> as<00:04:17.400> long<00:04:17.639> so<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.510> more

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
third as long so it's kind of more

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.149
