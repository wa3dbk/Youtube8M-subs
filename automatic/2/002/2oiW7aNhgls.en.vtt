00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.060
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:07.009
 to my youtube channel esequibo enough 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.169
 weeks almost two months without going up 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.610
 content without uploading video or uploading anything 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.740
 to channel 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.450
 I 'm going to give you an explanation of why 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.820
 of what he was doing lately and 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.230
 other good first thing is what was 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.680
 doing the network is to finish quite 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.500
 burned by the style of the customers 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.880
 I ended up quite tired so I 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.040
 is taking a few weeks as of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.099
 rest has been john other games 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.710
 type the final fantasy 7 to pokémons a 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.260
 mobile games to the initiated ska or up 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.240
 to different computer games 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.670
 varied rpg is of whatever it is not 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.780
 the big reason for this is mainly 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.790
 because I do not have good internet in my 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.650
 home if I play online at ico 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.270
 customers almost almost game just because 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.800
 many times so much I fall then if 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.590
 I have to make a duet depend on good 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.970
 and whenever the connection is not good 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.920
 the test scribes that the connection 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.110
 and calling the internet provider of 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.000
 almost every day I do not lie all the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.640
 days to see if there is politics but of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.530
 moment it seems that it is not going to be worth 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.240
 I hope that in a few weeks 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.950
 Let's have a belief that we can start 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.260
 upload content to both youtube and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.540
 tweets on a regular basis 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.980
 I think back with this youtube I think 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.780
 come back with more videos I already have a couple of 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.050
 series prepared for you both 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.030
 series with spanish people youtube 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.850
 Spanish how they were like they are black and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.920
 reve to see if you value calm who as 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
 series also internationally to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.390
 English level with people like they said ideo 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.910
 or more international people than all 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.170
 you know that all of us are 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.560
 simply to make different series 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 and that you can enjoy the channel 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.979
 now in tomorrow same I am going to tenerife 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.590
 I will tenerife to join the four 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.479
 musketeers back there in the house 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.329
 origin I will be going to be there 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.539
 about five days it takes up to five days 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.700
 with the people of origin with peque con con con 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.869
 its assumption and against these people I do not know 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 I think we're going to have a good time 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.939
 and we are going to be in the least they have gone 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.159
 also help you a little we are not going to 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.410
 help them we will be with them 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.940
 as a family more than more than playing 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.489
 but, well, I suppose there are still 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.909
 some some lots with with zidane and 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:19.040
 bacon and compete these people 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:23.310
 I'm currently still a little bit the bcs 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.650
 both European and American I see 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.060
 what is for me always the first 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.900
 written is like the weakest speed 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.180
 the same thing always happens 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 springs clip is like most of the people 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.020
 is always saying that it will be the most 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.640
 strong that this year is going to be the super 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 complicated and such and I always see 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 it hits me not because more the fact that 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.220
 has moved to Berlin the lc has been 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.620
 done with many teams have not been able 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 have a house or have had problems with 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.950
 housing issue and so on, with which 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.050
 have been able to enter enough and has not 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.030
 showed many teams the level 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.640
 expected we are not in week 7 if not 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.230
 I'm wrong and we're still waiting 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.180
 much more equipment like rock can be 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.459
 not like the same giants that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.110
 he was pointing very strongly from start to 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.209
 until elements not everyone thought 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.340
 that was going to be as much of yemen is 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.890
 as rock top 4 top 5 and they're 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.560
 quite pretty down I do not compare with 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.570
 the room I think next spirit 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.500
 the summer speed summer is going to be 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.050
 much better hope that my friend enrique 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.280
 and the people originating in and so on 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.200
 also level because I see that team very 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.910
 strong and at the same time 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.630
 I believe that Europe is simply going to 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.330
 evolve and will be in summer the spri 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.230
 far more competitive than 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.500
 spring that I think is always the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.900
 loose throne and also spend a little bit of 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.970
 Coaching topic that I'm seeing I see 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.329
 many teams that have coach there 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.160
 and others and I see that frankly not 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.079
 pose well the games do not see 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.480
 games that are the players what 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.010
 They hope to do the wonders they do 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.420
 Well, I guess I wrote it if 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.519
 trainings in that what one says 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.110
 well look at this game in our 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.790
 1000 lane is the rod will make a 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.860
 play that will win the game and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.200
 obviously you can ask yourself this way a 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.519
 heading waiting for your mid line to be 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.590
 frog in sean ucd akçakin sean be very 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.410
 able to win a game or you can 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.360
 directly from the backstage or from 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.920
 from your house prepare the game to do 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.690
 an approach and say 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.160
 let's play like this let's do this 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.200
 style we have other characters there are 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.730
 is not to fly this line you have to give 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.050
 this line must be protected from this 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.389
 because rival enemy sem to do this 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.550
 this, then, are approaches 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.950
 that there are many teams I will not do 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.510
 all there are only bcs equipment 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.190
 both Europe and American that yes that 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.050
 raises the matches very well but after 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.930
 that simply go without 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.220
 approach not that I can hardly believe 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.050
 that before the departure of narrator what 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 that are going to make the game not also a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.430
 little the theme of pixie bands there are many 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.200
 stages that frankly now that are 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.620
 scamming a lot and is playing 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.840
 much double ade there are many stages that 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.150
 honestly they do not come they do not come well 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.740
 with the characters we do not try like 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.470
 innovate with these characters with these 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.090
 mushrooms but we do not do the right thing nor 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.830
 nor he practically correct not by 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.360
 example with a bending setup and you're 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.850
 much guardian you need a lot 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.550
 positioning you are very fragile the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.960
 Dengue stages 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.300
 frankly I do not see teams that plant in 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.200
 that's too good but I hope that the 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.680
 level of coaches I think that 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.419
 will evolve 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.550
 there are very good coaches in the neighborhoods 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.500
 long I see every time people who know 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.750
 more of the game that you understand better and that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.569
 They are there behind and I hope it goes better 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.789
 I think for as I said 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.349
 a few seconds ago the script of 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.599
 summer is going to be much more powerful a lot 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.249
 more powerful let's see true 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.089
 true titans fight between 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.439
 equipment on top of the table and good 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.089
 without more right now as I say 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.089
 tomorrow I'm going to Tenerife, I'm going to the house 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:46.399
 origin of the next week to ski 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.319
 or not snowing that three years ago with 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.550
 this jealousy and sports that I could not 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.300
 at level you can not have a trip to snow 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.219
 and I have a lot of snow way I carry 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.080
 a couple of weeks doing a lot is not 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.240
 good to have followed social networks 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.339
 we are doing is the key in doing 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.430
 pretty sport and so on that with 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.779
 all this if it's for one thing that 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.249
 frankly I had to sacrifice in his 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.349
 time and I 'm recovering it and that 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.259
 produce fruit not so much not for that 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.889
 just playing the and others and good that 's 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.930
 everything in this block in this video what 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.229
 I have improvised a little before and I train 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.070
 says I have to stop a couple of series 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:26.640
 that we promised to compete the d 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.170
 hot kiss as they put the keys as the 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.920
 I also have an envelope 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.889
 predictions on how to make your 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.139
 skillsoft are usually hit more 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.389
 and well I have raised a couple of videos 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.969
 I have them there mounted I have them already for 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.259
 to edit and others and I hope in some 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.439
 few weeks would start to rise more 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.939
 content and I hope and hope you can 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.319
 re-hook the channel not only 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.210
 content the ico players but also a 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.430
 future in a couple of months the 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.779
 content to other video games either to 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.159
 role playing video games up to 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:58.779
 mobile video games i what i want 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:02.590
 is that you simply entertain yourself and if you 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:04.360
 you know with these visits and good 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.669
 that entertain more I do not want to be 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.779
 boring so do not forget how 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.610
 I always say in all videos that you want 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:10.870
 be a bit heavy this topic but of 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.060
 follow me both on facebook and in 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.870
 twitter that today publishing everything also 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.949
 give you to subscribe to the youtube channel and 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.229
 also good I'm going back with the 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.139
 tweets that I'm announcing and already they 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:25.599
 they have to subscribe there and without further 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:28.650
 many times you drank the video and remember 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:28.650
 always team is very slow
