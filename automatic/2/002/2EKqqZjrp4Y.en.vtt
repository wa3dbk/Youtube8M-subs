interested<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.429> how<00:00:11.610> well<00:00:11.849> witnesses<00:00:12.540> can

pick<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.200> perpetrator<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.160> lineup<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
pick out a perpetrator from a lineup and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.750 
pick out a perpetrator from a lineup and
what<00:00:15.179> factors<00:00:15.420> may<00:00:15.870> impact<00:00:16.340> accuracy<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.520> in

identification<00:00:24.680> one<00:00:25.680> factor<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> I've

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
identification one factor that I've

identification one factor that I've
spent<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> time<00:00:27.060> researching<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:28.019> age

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
spent a lot of time researching is age

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.700 
spent a lot of time researching is age
of<00:00:28.830> witness<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:30.090> old<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.840> witness<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.410> and

how age impacts identification accuracy
are<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:34.890> differences<00:00:35.250> between<00:00:35.640> children

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
are there differences between children

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600 
are there differences between children
and<00:00:36.450> adults<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:37.140> example<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.579> age

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and adults for example and at what age

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.799 
and adults for example and at what age
do<00:00:39.090> children<00:00:39.540> start<00:00:39.809> performing<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.530> adults

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
do children start performing as adults

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.389 
do children start performing as adults
what<00:00:42.809> surprises<00:00:43.469> me<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.649> most<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
what surprises me the most is that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
what surprises me the most is that
children<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.930> accurate<00:00:46.170> as

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
children can be just as accurate as

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
children can be just as accurate as
adults<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:47.700> they're<00:00:47.850> shown<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> lineup<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
adults when they're shown a lineup and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.110 
adults when they're shown a lineup and
the<00:00:48.930> perpetrators<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.160> line<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the perpetrators in that line up the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.900 
the perpetrators in that line up the
challenge<00:00:51.390> however<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.219> when<00:00:53.219> police<00:00:53.640> make

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
challenge however is when police make

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
challenge however is when police make
mistakes<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.530> perpetrator<00:00:56.160> actually<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
mistakes and the perpetrator actually is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
mistakes and the perpetrator actually is
not<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> lineup<00:00:57.510> suspect<00:00:58.489> unfortunately

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
not in the lineup suspect unfortunately

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
not in the lineup suspect unfortunately
child<00:00:59.850> witnesses<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.960> likely<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> pick

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
child witnesses are more likely to pick

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
child witnesses are more likely to pick
out<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:02.039> innocent<00:01:02.430> person<00:01:02.550> than<00:01:03.300> state<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
out an innocent person than state that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.280 
out an innocent person than state that
the<00:01:04.589> criminal<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.369> present<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:07.080> look

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the criminal is not present when we look

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.460 
the criminal is not present when we look
at<00:01:07.470> DNA<00:01:07.760> exoneration<00:01:08.760> cases<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.780> find<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
at DNA exoneration cases we find that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
at DNA exoneration cases we find that
the<00:01:11.130> primary<00:01:11.430> evidence<00:01:11.790> used<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.510> convict

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the primary evidence used to convict

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
the primary evidence used to convict
these<00:01:13.080> innocent<00:01:13.500> individuals<00:01:13.820> was

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
these innocent individuals was

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
these innocent individuals was
eyewitness<00:01:15.450> identification<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.770> are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
eyewitness identification so these are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
eyewitness identification so these are
witnesses<00:01:17.460> who<00:01:17.909> thought<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.390> had

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
witnesses who thought they had

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
witnesses who thought they had
identified<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.560> person<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.430> fact

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
identified the right person but in fact

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
identified the right person but in fact
were<00:01:20.880> wrong<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.930> defendants<00:01:22.500> often

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
were wrong and these defendants often

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
were wrong and these defendants often
spend<00:01:23.610> many<00:01:23.880> many<00:01:24.150> years<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.659> prison<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.470> not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
spend many many years in prison it's not

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
spend many many years in prison it's not
uncommon<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.310> example<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> have

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
uncommon for example for them to have

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.560 
uncommon for example for them to have
spent<00:01:27.810> 20<00:01:28.200> 30<00:01:28.710> 35<00:01:29.369> years<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.729> prison<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.329> order

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
spent 20 30 35 years in prison in order

to research our witness identification

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
to research our witness identification
we<00:01:32.909> typically<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.509> simulate<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.170> crime<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
we typically will simulate a crime in
