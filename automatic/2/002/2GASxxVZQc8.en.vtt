00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hey guys so today I'm be showing you how

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.629 
hey guys so today I'm be showing you how
to<00:00:03.899> take<00:00:04.859> off<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.580> auto<00:00:05.910> turn<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.569> Wi-Fi<00:00:07.049> thing

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 
to take off the auto turn on Wi-Fi thing

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.459 
to take off the auto turn on Wi-Fi thing
and<00:00:08.639> that's<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.120> called<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.450> think<00:00:09.540> but

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
and that's what it's called I think but

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
and that's what it's called I think but
it's<00:00:10.769> basically<00:00:11.190> when<00:00:11.550> you're<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.210> your<00:00:12.360> phone

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
it's basically when you're on your phone

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.970 
it's basically when you're on your phone
and<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:12.990> Wi-Fi<00:00:13.320> turns<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.769> by<00:00:13.950> itself

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and your Wi-Fi turns on by itself

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.029 
and your Wi-Fi turns on by itself
without<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.849> even<00:00:15.059> uh<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.560> clicking

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
without you even uh you know clicking

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.109 
without you even uh you know clicking
and<00:00:17.190> return<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:20.310> might<00:00:20.550> drain<00:00:21.000> your

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and return on and this might drain your

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.349 
and return on and this might drain your
battery<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.710> might<00:00:22.859> be<00:00:22.980> annoying<00:00:23.240> like<00:00:24.240> it

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
battery or it might be annoying like it

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.670 
battery or it might be annoying like it
was<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.740> sprint<00:00:26.130> claims<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.730> this

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
was to me now sprint claims that this

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
was to me now sprint claims that this
basically<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.070> meant<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:29.820> your

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
basically it's meant to make your

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.100 
basically it's meant to make your
battery<00:00:30.869> last<00:00:31.109> longer<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.540> to<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> good

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
battery last longer and to get a good

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
battery last longer and to get a good
connection<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.710> maybe<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.280> if<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
connection so maybe if you have if you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.950 
connection so maybe if you have if you
have<00:00:35.760> bad<00:00:35.969> connection<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.480> house<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
have bad connection in your house it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400 
have bad connection in your house it
will<00:00:36.989> Auto<00:00:37.260> connect<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:38.219> Wi-Fi<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> if

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
will Auto connect to your Wi-Fi but if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.720 
will Auto connect to your Wi-Fi but if
you<00:00:40.620> don't<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> even<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:42.540> supposed<00:00:43.110> to

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
you don't have it even it's supposed to

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.610 
you don't have it even it's supposed to
connect<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> ones<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> have

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
connect to the ones that you have

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.770 
connect to the ones that you have
previously<00:00:46.620> connected<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.539> people

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
previously connected to but some people

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
previously connected to but some people
don't<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.700> even

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
don't like this like I do because even

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.680 
don't like this like I do because even
if<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.289> Wi-Fi<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> turned<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.329> still

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
if my Wi-Fi is turned off it will still

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
if my Wi-Fi is turned off it will still
auto<00:00:55.050> connect<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> weird<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
auto connect which is kind of weird so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.360 
auto connect which is kind of weird so
here<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.960> let<00:00:58.530> me<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:58.920> password<00:00:59.570> and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
here we go let me put in my password and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.830 
here we go let me put in my password and
you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.399> always<00:01:02.670> turn<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> back<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
you can always turn it back on this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.120

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
to go to it will be the first setting so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
to go to it will be the first setting so
B<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.509> Android<00:01:21.930> phones<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
B this is for all Android phones it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
B this is for all Android phones it
should<00:01:22.770> work<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> same<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
should work the same thing if it's a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
should work the same thing if it's a
newer<00:01:24.720> version<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.979> supports<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.939> because

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
newer version that supports this because

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.950 
newer version that supports this because
my<00:01:27.420> older<00:01:28.009> lg<00:01:29.009> optimus<00:01:29.040> v<00:01:29.670> does<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
my older lg optimus v does not have this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
my older lg optimus v does not have this
so<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.150> going

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so you would go to more and it's going

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.710 
so you would go to more and it's going
to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.420> under<00:01:33.570> mobile<00:01:34.079> networks<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.630> we

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to be under mobile networks so here we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
to be under mobile networks so here we
go<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:39.329> click<00:01:39.600> mobile<00:01:39.840> networks<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.299> here<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
go to click mobile networks and here we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
go to click mobile networks and here we
go<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.840> 3G<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> connection

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
go it will be 3G and connection

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
go it will be 3G and connection

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.120 
that makes your Wi-Fi turn on by itself
without<00:01:54.479> even<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.140> activating<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> was

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
without even you activating out that was

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.560 
without even you activating out that was
like<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> glitch<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.729> phone<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> did

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
like a glitch in the phone but I did

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.899 
like a glitch in the phone but I did
some<00:01:57.719> research<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> apparently<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.850> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
some research and apparently not so you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
some research and apparently not so you
want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> click<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.799> basically<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
want to click it and basically what you
