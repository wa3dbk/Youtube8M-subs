00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.460
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.570
 a new video of mine yes my 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.130
 last video is now already one 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.640
 a bit longer ago so the lingering 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.650
 weeks 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.510
 and yes that was just because of me 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.010
 Many writers have written now 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.439
 we have a little bit more time 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.690
 and can thus make more videos 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.010
 and yes we can see from here 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.050
 there is no fischer view this time 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.129
 but a call of duty video of that 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.350
 Now for a few days before the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.520
 published call of duty goes and yes 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.230
 that does not mean that I am with many 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.280
 videos will somehow stop but 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.120
 I have also in my first video 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 I probably said that 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
 not only specialize in viva videos 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.570
 but I was once too 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.339
 So it's pretty insecure 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.930
 Now I am pretty sure that I am 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.580
 just want to do several things 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.830
 there will also be something better 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.790
 and everything and that's why 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.650
 I do not know why I mean 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.330
 names so selected simply fifa 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.440
 but he has to look I wanted him 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.420
 anyway change 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.400
 and yes, but I just look like 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.260
 said today it's just call of 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.610
 Duty and I just want to show 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.770
 like in the new game corner for 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.440
 the gus is best at very fast level 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.930
 can and yes, we'll see you soon 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.000
 the first of the new game modes hurt 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.500
 or in German stimulated and how 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.150
 the people who do not know the explain 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.640
 I once very briefly now what is in 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.020
 this game mode is like you 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.210
 you can always see here after 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 he made a foot so has one 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.050
 opponent has killed a 30-second time 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.000
 span and in the time span you have to 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.360
 stop the next film otherwise 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.490
 you explode and yes 30 30 seconds 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.760
 are you also extremely fast so you 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.200
 move much faster and load 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.840
 also faster after all so everything is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.780
 so a little more stimulated like 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.790
 the name already says and looks after everyone 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.770
 a lot of fun on a little camper 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.940
 because yes because if you sit a corner 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.450
 then you want to explode after three 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.300
 seconds 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.280
 so you have to play very offensive and 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.840
 All people have to do that and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.210
 that's very good and that pleases 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 me also in this game mode yes and you 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 get in this game very much 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.709
 very much express is really extreme 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.729
 that such a game lasts like that 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.290
 maximum four to five minutes 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.849
 most are not average like that 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.510
 around the three minutes and really there 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.250
 xp so really to 200 points cup and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.480
 sometimes only 300 sown neither now 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.319
 I even get 300 points sometimes 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.670
 400 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.670
 recently made on the dorp 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.260
 got 700 points and now it was 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.389
 yes still double xp so that one again 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.069
 the double 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.019
 and that was extremely big, too 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.569
 if there are no double xp's worth it 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.180
 the mode really to play since he 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.389
 halt most expedia is join 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.879
 simply in team deathmatch you do 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.709
 just stop 100 I think I look and so on 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.370
 game team deathmatch lasts too 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.349
 much longer 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.749
 and yes so I would advise him times 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.099
 to play sick 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.200
 and yes, there is one more here 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.609
 another tip from me and that you see 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.489
 now here is a round search and rescue 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.620
 So search and save and that's it too 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.500
 I have to do that very well to level 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.060
 say it takes a whole round 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.060
 a little bit longer so there it is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.889
 I believe until 4 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.900
 and it has destroyed the visions 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.280
 Most need to know that and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.209
 then he does a lot of xp but so 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.159
 a game can also be up to 15 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.659
 minutes even go average 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.549
 the eight to ten minutes 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.099
 but he does a lot I expect 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.659
 I believe 250 points per ge and then 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.310
 the adversary leaves his mark voluntarily 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.340
 the lonely real innovations 50 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.879
 xp you got 500 and now 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.139
 at the double xp weekend this was 2000 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.379
 but still 500 are already one 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.549
 amount 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.060
 and if I stop then I believe that 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.680
 round because it is not so good 61 but then 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.409
 56 of 3,000 xp and then you turn off 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.759
 anyway, christian always such 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.109
 achievements or challenge 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.400
 and then he makes more and more cross-I 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.639
 Average on the weekend 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.829
 now get 10,000 xp and if it is 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.090
 13,000 even ran very well and when it did 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.379
 stop then not the double xp 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.389
 weekend would have been then I stop at the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.699
 five to 8000 xp get what but synonymous 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.069
 really big amount of ex ps and yes then 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.810
 Hold the best Legs game modes I have 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.870
 would recommend you to play if you are 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.639
 just want to learn quickly and yes what 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.729
 there's something else to say about it 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.539
 actually not the video must 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.769
 also be over soon 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.000
 that's just the two best 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.199
 playing modes while being stimulated he 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.509
 is offensive then everything works 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.470
 because you keep yourself open 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.330
 must move and also 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.030
 yes weapons must because otherwise yes 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.940
 simple and looking at you and explode 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.500
 destroy or seek and save 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.210
 you have to stop or you can you should 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.190
 It is better to recommend a bit 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.930
 Defensive play directly from what will 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 one just kills and then the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.490
 opponents still the yes the brand you there 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.800
 drop is collected by the opponent and 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.600
 yes then you're dead too and must 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.860
 wait a whole round and then do it 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600
 that does not make much sense now 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.190
 That's why you should definitely one 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.450
 play a bit more defensive and that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.830
 whole takes a bit 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.400
 longer so just by yourself 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.470
 recommend to watch as your game is 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.120
 that is what she likes and she likes 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.730
 Hold on so forward throws me so 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.190
 personally makes up or stops 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.750
 hurt more fun if you stop there 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.880
 just move more and it is 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.810
 just a really cool mode and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.730
 Of course he'll still hold a 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.860
 Find and save a few more experts 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.669
 but that is somehow too boring for me 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.440
 but that's just my personal 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.290
 So sometimes it makes sense 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.550
 Of course it's fun, but it has to be one 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.050
 everyone for themselves know that content 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.870
 the two game modes i recommend you 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.490
 if you quickly level volts and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.040
 the water should actually be 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.060
 here you see 61 I do not have it either 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.110
 child made more in the round has that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.750
 video liked 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.640
 and yes about a positive rating 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.820
 I would be happy and announce until the 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.920
 next time 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.870
 what I forgot to mention 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.910
 that I recommend you to the best 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.510
 the new operations would come to an end 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.670
 anzugucken 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.470
 These are just such tasks with those 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.540
 he still gets xp additionally 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.190
 You can and she wore points with them 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.300
 you can unlock your stuff and 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.080
 yes there are always such tasks 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.910
 to defuse those 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.770
 three bombs or something and that are 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.260
 actually very easy to do and there 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.930
 he also gets xp who wanted that 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.400
 I just mention it and then 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.790
 I say goodbye again and to the 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.790
 next time
