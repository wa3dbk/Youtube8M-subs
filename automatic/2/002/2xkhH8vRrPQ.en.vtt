 it's really not age or is it for 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.180
 all of us that you like but 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.240
 is the most luminous moisturized skin 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.979
 more good effect more bone face 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.649
 as if we saw two videos a couple of 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.590

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.170
 of vitamin C is a fantastic product 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.390
 and then we have what cream is 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.079
 cream we would have three presentations 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.270
 different we would have a lotion that the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.560
 adoption is like being here I'm going to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.810
 teaching allows me this which is the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.390
 Transparent is a revitalizing lotion 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 for for skins or mixed or oily 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
 people who like very textures 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.369
 very very very light 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.950
 Okay I 'm so advised a lot for 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.850
 guys but guys do not usually show you 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 the more fatty textures then we have the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 radiance the radiant is the fluid 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.730
 bright comment that takes extract 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.720
 from manu salva who is also 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.420
 clarifying vale will help us for the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.580
 subject of spots and aside me about 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.980
 luminous pigments that what make us 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.049
 is give us even more luminosity is 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.670
 say when the skin is very off 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.580
 we go directly to the rayyan that is 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 the one that gives us that spectacular 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.840
 really on the skin and it's also that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.730
 fluid 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.510
 the adoption itself is so that the mixed 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 fat the radiance series for normal skin 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.900
 mixed more drier some that drier 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.790
 because even if it's fluid one year so 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.860
 the more mixed I like to give the cream 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.780
 worth the cream is for all kinds of 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.730
 skins really but me for skin 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.740
 mixed I like more to give this cream 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.380
 because texture is a texture in 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.260
 gel cream is a feeling of freshness that 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 you note on the skin is wonderful or 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.340
 you wake up in the morning you clean 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.930
 your skin and you put this cream with the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 serum and the truth is that it gives you a 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.400
 vitality and a desire to start well 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.680
 the morning that is a pass and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 apart is that it is cream that gives nothing of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.180
 fat is wonderful 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
 ok and then good systems products in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.480
 the line but I brought some 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.610

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.800
 what are the blisters are the blisters 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.050
 which can be used in two ways 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.480
 can use good comment that the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.190
 blisters carries the pure vitamin c vale 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.290

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.689

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.680

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 no problem of oxidation in the skin 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.189
 what they sometimes say that makes me 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.170
 little spot is vitamin c here there is no 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.560
 no problem appeared because I do not know 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.560
