00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
there and I can just connect them BAM

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.869 
there and I can just connect them BAM
now<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> got<00:03:18.269> another<00:03:18.510> Road<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:19.109> cool<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.310> can

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
now I got another Road there cool I can

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.719 
now I got another Road there cool I can
destroy<00:03:21.180> stuff<00:03:21.599> like<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.530> bullish<00:03:22.979> whoops<00:03:23.489> I
