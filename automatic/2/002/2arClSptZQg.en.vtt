 weak as well as threatens us and a 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.850
 development opportunity 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.479
 each being an actor of his own 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.580
 development 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.710
 we have the opportunity to define 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.110
 fairly specific action plans where everyone 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.880
 is a part of the subject so much 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.229
 commercial production 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.229
 when export finance 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.630
 we spend about 6 to 7% of our 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.640
 payroll every year in the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.350
 training for both our executives and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.510
 our employees in factories 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.490
 we put in place a program of 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.970
 training for our information executives 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.500
 annual is done each month where each of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.720
 my frames are in touch with others 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.720
 executives from other companies their sector 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.090
 of activity production commerce management 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.490
 human resources finance that allows 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.229
 to discuss their needs on 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.710
 tools that allows them to progress to 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.710
 within companies 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.800
 a significant commitment within 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.960
 the company and one of my wishes 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.810
 is that my employees are in very good 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.340
 my work is done through 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.570
 formations that are put in place is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.890
 also to have good tools of 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.660
 production lately we 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.920
 invests 1 million euros this year 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.370
 still invest in new 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.530
 machinery 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.640
 about 500 thousand euros of which a will 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.860
 technological to always be ahead 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.060
 compared to our market what we 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.800
 allows to take advanced by 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.700
 report to our confreres to give 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.580
 also means 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.230
 manufacturing and planning through 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.269
 the gp11 that allows us to make 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.830
 significant gains in terms of time and 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.110
 priority management 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.340
 I also insist on the remuneration the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.319
 compensation is important today 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.700
 must think about the movement of its employees 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.930
 executives and non-managers 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.000
 we set up a contract 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.099
 of interest that affects the whole 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.870
 teams and it's through our 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.730
 street of expression and well that we 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.140
 allows to clear an envelope for the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.519
 redistribute to all staff 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.519
 we also have goal bonuses 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.560
 we have developed iso applications 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 2000 version 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.730
 8 in order to secure 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 so much money in this area 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.370
 in the building than to regulate the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.200
 swear and what allowed us to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.540
 make significant progress in these 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.040
 companies a rate of non-compliance of 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.040
 0 20% of turnover
