00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
think the current upper recommended

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.800 
think the current upper recommended
intake<00:00:21.530> level<00:00:21.950> is<00:00:22.130> now<00:00:22.880> four<00:00:23.240> thousand

intake level is now four thousand
international<00:00:24.109> units<00:00:24.529> or<00:00:25.010> IU<00:00:25.189> per<00:00:25.939> day<00:00:26.320> now<00:00:27.320> it

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
international units or IU per day now it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.099 
international units or IU per day now it
depends<00:00:28.490> however<00:00:28.849> what<00:00:29.359> age<00:00:29.539> group<00:00:29.869> you're<00:00:30.050> in
