00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.559
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.530
 learn how to make a recording on a 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.800
 using exclusively vinegar 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.600
 salt and a source of energy 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.210
 you may be using a battery 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.800
 of 9 volts or a 12 volt source 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.510
 in this case we will use a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.000
 12 volt source 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.039
 so we have here already the piece that goes 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.460
 be engraved this knife 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.809
 we're going to do in this recording format 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.229
 of a delta triangle we already have a knife 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.640
 where we made this same recording 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.719
 this is the end result we'll be 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 proven 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.370
 soon the solution we will 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:57.129
 use white vinegar 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:01:03.729
 bissau the amount of apps a tape 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:08.850
 adhesive and soon after we go to 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.850
 recording of the video accompanies the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.460
 on the knife blade 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.500
 in the case of the negative we will connect 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.510
 end of the swab that will be 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 decided with the solution of vinegar salt 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.190
 approaching the region where it will be 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.390
 the recording through a reaction 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.260
 recording will start in the play. 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.450
 and after a few seconds 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.590
 we will already observe the term of this 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:12.249
 recording we go we have here 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:15.900
 our vinegar solution are let's 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:19.390
 connect source negative 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.569
 here at the end of the swab and let's 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:29.230
 now approaching the region where 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:32.340
 made the recording that much 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.340
 the process is simple 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.500
 let's remove here using the other side 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.500
 the swab 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:32.640
 ok the recording is already finished 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.310
 Let's disconnect by turning off the power supply. 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.390
 We will now remove the wash sticker 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.770
 The knife 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.750
 soon after we'll be 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.310
 demonstrating the result for you 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.810
 we already called ok people already 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.570
 we're back, we've already done the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:55.240
 cleaning the part and we have our recording 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:00.910
 from our delta a knife blade 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:07.830
 ok this is the end result of the recording 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:12.580
 it will not be removed a recording 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.060
 definitive rock simple and fast to be 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.060
 made 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.020
 the result is really cool 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.380
 Let's stay here a hug to everyone. 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.380
 and until our next meeting
