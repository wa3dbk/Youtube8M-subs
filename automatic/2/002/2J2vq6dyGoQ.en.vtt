we<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.420> further<00:02:02.720> edit<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:04.780> kind<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.810> shows<00:02:06.020> us

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
we can further edit it kind of shows us

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.109 
we can further edit it kind of shows us
the<00:02:06.350> image<00:02:06.620> how<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.100> duration<00:02:07.820> that's<00:02:07.970> going

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the image how the duration that's going

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.550 
the image how the duration that's going
to<00:02:08.179> show<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.929> make<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> longer<00:02:09.410> or

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
to show it you can make it longer or

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.150 
to show it you can make it longer or
shorter<00:02:10.870> you<00:02:11.870> can<00:02:12.110> transform<00:02:12.740> them<00:02:12.980> by

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
shorter you can transform them by

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.360 
shorter you can transform them by
rotating<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.240> even<00:02:14.600> cutting<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.370> smaller

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
rotating it or even cutting it smaller

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.010 
rotating it or even cutting it smaller
making<00:02:16.910> smaller<00:02:17.209> if<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> only<00:02:17.600> want<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
making smaller if you only want to see a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.910 
making smaller if you only want to see a
subsection<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> screen<00:02:20.680> again<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.800> can

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
subsection of the screen again you can

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.970 
subsection of the screen again you can
drag<00:02:22.130> items<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.850> reorder<00:02:23.090> them<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.980> then

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
drag items to reorder them and then

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.350 
drag items to reorder them and then
basically<00:02:25.190> when<00:02:25.489> you're<00:02:25.610> done<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.000> done

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
basically when you're done is it done

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880 
basically when you're done is it done
you<00:02:26.690> can<00:02:26.840> preview<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.380> see<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.739> make

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
you can preview it to see it to make

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.630 
you can preview it to see it to make
sure<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.280> want<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.280> see<00:02:31.430> kind
