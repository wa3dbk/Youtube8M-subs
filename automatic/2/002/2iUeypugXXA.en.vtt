00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.130

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 Now ask yourself what ultra debate fact 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.000
 and if they want to know more about it 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.320
 then check the internet 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.220
 I wanted to guarantee the xbox 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.590
 the emulator there is still to say 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.570
 I can make the power so high because of the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 pc if a good rafft map 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.260
 not such a good power came view 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.320

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.970

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.600
 vending machines play this feature 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.520

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:37.440
 here graphic about a torque x9 or 3d 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.989
 3d or opengl depending on the pc you can do that 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.450
 choose 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.120

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.500
 you shut that away I once put that 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.709
 uno-seat weather unfortunately not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.709
 Babbel is a good cook 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.640
 in the super mario bros and sean penn 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.090
 and everything else as new start super 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.090
 mario bros 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.920
 that will be a bit slower 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:10.310
 be because i bendiek the engine 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.310
 out 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.690
 he was one of user profi could 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.280
 little insight about the graphics are 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.400
 Now we're watching the match 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.640
 That's what I really like mine 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.840
 favorite auto parts plays storm 1 have 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.840
 we just did everything right 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.580
 get the game 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
 red 

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:24.679
 I had a nice round 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:27.149
 harmon had a few small bugs or something 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:29.129
 because you can record with band cellar otherwise 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:31.619
 the liquid remains off depending on the pc like 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.669
 already said each modulator one can 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.319
 change that 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.209
 you just have to get the graphic 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:41.159
 Try something for you but the best 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:43.729
 otherwise it runs smoothly I could have 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:47.039
 actually more like games tolerated 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:51.419
 i like the little work svp later on 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:54.989
 record of ultimate russ 21 no 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.489
 already know brand but that is still 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.929
 better 

00:06:55.489 --> 00:07:02.909
 For that I even put a ps3 extra 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:04.739

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:08.519
