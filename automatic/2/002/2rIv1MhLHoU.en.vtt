00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.190
 let's start right from this you home to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:28.160
 extension 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:30.940
 naturally literally immediately this is before 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.940
 refit 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.510
 manufacturer of such equipment is not 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.490
 recommended 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.040
 send a washing torch to the car 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.410
 scatter so as not to hurt 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.160
 paintwork even ours now 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.700
 Crete is not recommended to send but in 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.440
 in this case after taking the car 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.440
 in repair it is necessary to do 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.140
 and that the washing process 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.120
 you discovered something new you 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.099
 expecting something else to see 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.879
 it's good that you talk it over 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:35.970
 the customer if you said the price when 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:39.790
 the car was here dirt 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.480
 sorry you can only ask but not 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.480
 insist 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.390
 well now let's go around the car 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 we'll see 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.860
 see yes 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.190
 here is also a moda view 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 here you can also see yes 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:32.400
 Here I hope, too, can be seen full painting in 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:36.410
 us contract well except for thresholds 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.520
 whether I showed, I will not intervene there 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.910
 here and now when she say so about 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.590
 Gale need 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.540
 the number is not asked not to show the wrong 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.480
 that did not ask 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.480
 daws asked not to show 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.220
 that under the bumpers guess yes 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.220
 now have time to think 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.989
 u did you say the price is correct 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:22.720
 Have you discussed by the customer after 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.509
 you saw the upcoming work front i 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.330
 don't even open the door and don't show 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:36.070
 openings and that's not too late yet 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:41.460
 not late you can just just give away 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.460
 deposit to the customer to apologize and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.639
 make up for that car's downtime 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.639
 that you washed him 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:05:01.180
 otherwise don't be sad 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.990
 cheer up and to work but for now i'm 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.790
 I'll do this machine here 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.160
 showed 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.160
 and this cord 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.180
 time to think 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:29.550
 and then she understands everything Iâ€™m talking about 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:34.470
 yes that's about this disease of many many 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.370
 home appliances yes here here here here 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:44.370
 short circuit happens 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:51.930
 Try to take from here, but probably 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:56.639
 obviously there will be no further 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:04.020
 these are such self-tapping screws 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:07.710
 yes here such let's try them 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:12.030
 unscrew and figure out what's there 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:17.130
 here look give well to whom it is already visible 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:19.740
 gone on the verge of wear on the verge of unscrew 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.580
 and figure out how we can do it 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.580
 settle
