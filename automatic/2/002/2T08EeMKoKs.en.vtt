league<00:00:15.190> that<00:00:15.219> you'd<00:00:15.580> like<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.759> see<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:16.150> take<00:00:16.360> in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
league that you'd like to see it take in

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.070

continuing<00:00:17.590> its<00:00:17.710> growth

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
continuing its growth

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.200 
continuing its growth
well<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.250> simple<00:00:21.430> question<00:00:21.609> that's<00:00:22.029> not

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
well that's a simple question that's not

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.990 
well that's a simple question that's not
so<00:00:22.420> simple<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:22.900> answer<00:00:23.369> there's<00:00:24.369> I<00:00:24.550> think<00:00:24.699> a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
so simple to answer there's I think a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.429 
so simple to answer there's I think a
lot<00:00:25.180> of<00:00:25.300> things<00:00:25.510> that<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:25.779> leak<00:00:25.990> and<00:00:26.140> improve

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
lot of things that the leak and improve

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.689 
lot of things that the leak and improve
on<00:00:26.619> I<00:00:26.650> think<00:00:26.949> they've<00:00:27.070> done<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.250> great<00:00:27.400> job<00:00:27.519> in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
on I think they've done a great job in

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.669 
on I think they've done a great job in
the<00:00:27.910> first<00:00:28.390> three<00:00:28.720> years<00:00:28.750> establishing

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
the first three years establishing

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.410 
the first three years establishing
themselves<00:00:29.859> but<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.369> think<00:00:30.429> there's<00:00:31.210> some

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
themselves but I think there's some

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.810 
themselves but I think there's some
things<00:00:31.630> I<00:00:31.779> can<00:00:31.960> get<00:00:32.110> better<00:00:32.230> I<00:00:32.379> think<00:00:32.820> travel

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
things I can get better I think travel

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.070 
things I can get better I think travel
and<00:00:33.910> accommodations<00:00:34.449> could<00:00:34.720> do<00:00:34.839> a<00:00:34.870> little

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
and accommodations could do a little

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.049 
and accommodations could do a little
better<00:00:35.260> I<00:00:35.410> just<00:00:35.530> think<00:00:35.980> some<00:00:36.519> direct<00:00:36.790> flights

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
better I just think some direct flights

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:37.650 
better I just think some direct flights
can<00:00:37.269> be<00:00:37.300> better

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
can be better

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.299 
can be better
I<00:00:37.809> think<00:00:38.230> Portland<00:00:38.469> I<00:00:38.680> set<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.980> standard

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
I think Portland I set the standard

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.830 
I think Portland I set the standard
really<00:00:39.489> high<00:00:39.700> but<00:00:39.910> some<00:00:40.059> other<00:00:40.210> clubs<00:00:40.540> in<00:00:40.690> this

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
really high but some other clubs in this

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.060 
really high but some other clubs in this
league<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.200> think<00:00:41.410> have<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.649> have<00:00:41.770> a<00:00:41.860> full-time

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
league I think have to have a full-time

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.209 
league I think have to have a full-time
training<00:00:42.520> staff<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:43.149> a<00:00:43.239> management<00:00:43.870> staff<00:00:44.350> I

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
training staff and a management staff I

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.430 
training staff and a management staff I
think<00:00:45.640> training<00:00:46.149> facilities<00:00:46.809> could<00:00:47.140> improve

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
think training facilities could improve

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.680 
think training facilities could improve
a<00:00:47.500> little<00:00:47.649> throughout<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.250> league<00:00:48.690> again

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
a little throughout the league again

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.150 
a little throughout the league again
Portland<00:00:50.079> how's<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.500> standard<00:00:50.949> but<00:00:51.129> I

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
Portland how's that that standard but I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.650 
Portland how's that that standard but I
just<00:00:51.399> think<00:00:51.579> other<00:00:51.820> teams<00:00:52.090> need<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.329> follow

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
just think other teams need to follow

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.779 
just think other teams need to follow
suit<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.260> think<00:00:53.829> also<00:00:53.980> there<00:00:54.309> needs<00:00:54.520> to<00:00:54.610> be<00:00:54.699> a

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
suit I think also there needs to be a

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.660 
suit I think also there needs to be a
positive<00:00:55.620> outlook<00:00:56.620> from<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.980> players<00:00:57.309> so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
positive outlook from the players so

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.279 
positive outlook from the players so
international<00:00:58.329> players<00:00:58.600> want<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.870> come<00:00:59.050> play

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
international players want to come play

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.830 
international players want to come play
in<00:00:59.850> anubius<00:01:00.850> cellar<00:01:01.059> right<00:01:01.239> now<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.449> don't<00:01:01.629> know

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
in anubius cellar right now I don't know

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.189 
in anubius cellar right now I don't know
if<00:01:02.050> that's<00:01:02.640> apparent<00:01:03.869> throughout<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.050> world

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
if that's apparent throughout the world

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.380 
if that's apparent throughout the world
because<00:01:05.740> there<00:01:06.399> are<00:01:06.550> some<00:01:06.729> inconsistencies

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
because there are some inconsistencies

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.540 
because there are some inconsistencies
on<00:01:07.810> win<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.229> league<00:01:08.410> but<00:01:08.740> we'll<00:01:09.009> start<00:01:09.280> when

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
on win the league but we'll start when

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.730 
on win the league but we'll start when
it<00:01:09.640> will<00:01:09.759> end<00:01:09.789> how<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:10.479> not<00:01:11.050> consistent<00:01:11.470> with

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
it will end how it's not consistent with

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.040 
it will end how it's not consistent with
European<00:01:12.580> schedules<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:13.599> I<00:01:13.660> think<00:01:13.750> there's<00:01:13.959> a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
European schedules so I think there's a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.480 
European schedules so I think there's a
few<00:01:14.229> things<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.800> we<00:01:15.250> could<00:01:15.340> definitely

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
few things that we could definitely

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.580 
few things that we could definitely
improve<00:01:15.970> on<00:01:16.149> also<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:16.899> think<00:01:17.050> there's<00:01:17.349> a<00:01:17.440> lot<00:01:17.560> of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
improve on also I think there's a lot of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.949 
improve on also I think there's a lot of
interest<00:01:17.950> from<00:01:18.069> MLS<00:01:18.610> teams<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.599> wring<00:01:19.750> out<00:01:19.869> new

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
interest from MLS teams to wring out new

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.510 
interest from MLS teams to wring out new
b-cell<00:01:20.229> teams<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.649> I<00:01:20.679> think<00:01:20.800> that's<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.399> great

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
b-cell teams so I think that's a great

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.859 
b-cell teams so I think that's a great
thing<00:01:21.729> for<00:01:21.759> us<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.060> see<00:01:22.300> because<00:01:22.569> you<00:01:22.690> see

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
thing for us to see because you see

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.359 
thing for us to see because you see
Portland<00:01:23.319> and<00:01:23.410> Houston<00:01:23.530> being<00:01:24.009> two<00:01:24.160> of<00:01:24.190> the

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
Portland and Houston being two of the

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.660 
Portland and Houston being two of the
teams<00:01:24.580> that<00:01:24.729> bring<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.660> lot<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.920> fans<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.340> fan

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
teams that bring a lot of fans so fan

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.550 
teams that bring a lot of fans so fan
support<00:01:27.910> and<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.750> carries<00:01:28.990> over<00:01:29.110> from<00:01:29.289> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
support and it carries over from the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.589 
support and it carries over from the
men's<00:01:29.770> side<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.310> there's<00:01:30.910> there's<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.330> lot<00:01:31.360> of

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
men's side so there's there's a lot of

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.089 
men's side so there's there's a lot of
things<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.929> think<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.319> we<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.619> improve<00:01:32.920> on

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
things I think that we can improve on

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.650 
things I think that we can improve on
but<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.490> have<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.759> take<00:01:33.910> it<00:01:34.030> year<00:01:34.179> by<00:01:34.300> year<00:01:34.479> and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
but we have to take it year by year and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.600

accommodations like I told you there's a
lot<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.660> things<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:04.989> we<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.319> need<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.649> improve

think there's things that the enemies
I<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.730> improve<00:02:11.970> upon<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> hopefully<00:02:12.540> next

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I can improve upon and hopefully next

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290
