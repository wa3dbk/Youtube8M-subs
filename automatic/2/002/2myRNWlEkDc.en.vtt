00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a couple of turn mill commands to do

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.050 
a couple of turn mill commands to do
this<00:00:24.829> so<00:00:25.829> just<00:00:26.249> open<00:00:26.369> terminal<00:00:26.669> up<00:00:28.820> how<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.880> do

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
will actually automatically shut

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.900 
will actually automatically shut
yourself<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.310> example<00:00:47.790> I<00:00:47.850> could

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
yourself down so for example I could

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
yourself down so for example I could
type<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.330> 60<00:00:48.870> minutes<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.470> within<00:00:50.250> 60<00:00:50.670> minutes

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
type in 60 minutes and within 60 minutes

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
type in 60 minutes and within 60 minutes
the<00:00:51.930> Mac<00:00:52.200> will<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:52.950> shut<00:00:53.220> yourself<00:00:53.370> down

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the Mac will actually shut yourself down

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760 
the Mac will actually shut yourself down
for<00:00:54.450> we<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.720> just<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> half<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.350> hour

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
for we should just do it in half an hour

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
for we should just do it in half an hour
type<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> foot<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.490> minutes<00:00:56.790> then<00:00:57.450> once<00:00:58.290> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
type in foot in minutes then once it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.930 
type in foot in minutes then once it's
carried<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.830> 30<00:00:59.220> minutes<00:00:59.580> it<00:00:59.790> will

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
carried down from 30 minutes it will

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
carried down from 30 minutes it will
automatically<00:01:00.420> shut<00:01:00.690> down<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.470> you<00:01:01.560> do<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
automatically shut down so you do is

press ENTER to confirm

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
press ENTER to confirm
it<00:01:03.360> will<00:01:03.480> probably<00:01:03.630> actually<00:01:03.840> free<00:01:04.080> password

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it will probably actually free password

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
it will probably actually free password
just<00:01:05.280> type<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:07.039> as<00:01:08.039> you<00:01:08.249> can<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.579> it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
just type that in as you can see it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700 
just type that in as you can see it's
going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> shut<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.749> 30<00:01:09.869> minutes<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
going to shut down in 30 minutes and it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.120 
going to shut down in 30 minutes and it
is<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.219> even<00:01:11.460> gave<00:01:11.789> me<00:01:11.999> the<00:01:12.509> time<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.130> confirm

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
is it's even gave me the time to confirm

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.060 
is it's even gave me the time to confirm
what<00:01:14.340> time<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> actually<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> shut<00:01:15.299> down

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
what time is actually going to shut down

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
what time is actually going to shut down
alternatively<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.429> this<00:01:17.670> terminal

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
alternatively you can use this terminal

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.669 
alternatively you can use this terminal
command<00:01:18.749> similar<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> previous<00:01:20.069> one<00:01:20.450> sudo

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
command similar to the previous one sudo

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.469 
command similar to the previous one sudo
shutdown<00:01:24.049> -<00:01:25.049> H<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:26.520> time<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> type<00:01:27.329> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
shutdown - H this time you can type in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
shutdown - H this time you can type in
the<00:01:27.569> actual<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:28.109> so<00:01:28.499> if<00:01:28.679> I<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.950> 11<00:01:29.369> p.m.<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the actual time so if I want 11 p.m. or

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.319 
the actual time so if I want 11 p.m. or
type<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> 2300<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.789> 11:30<00:01:35.789> then<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> would

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
type in 2300 for one 11:30 then it would

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
type in 2300 for one 11:30 then it would
be<00:01:36.649> 23<00:01:37.649> foot<00:01:39.020> presenter<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:41.219> it<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.460> then

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
be 23 foot presenter and it will then

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.319 
be 23 foot presenter and it will then
just<00:01:41.759> confirm<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> short<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.729> pick<00:01:45.240> my

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
just confirm the short down pick my

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.199 
just confirm the short down pick my
ossified<00:01:45.719> password<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.549> simple<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:47.969> that

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
ossified password so it's simple as that

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.300 
ossified password so it's simple as that
so<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.689> will<00:01:48.840> automatically<00:01:49.560> show<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.130> down

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so it will automatically show you down

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
so it will automatically show you down
your<00:01:50.729> computer<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> main<00:01:52.469> reason<00:01:54.049> two

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
your computer so the main reason two

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.260 
your computer so the main reason two
terminal<00:01:55.619> commands<00:01:56.039> is<00:01:56.189> basically<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.179> I'm

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
terminal commands is basically if I'm
