00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
eyeball off it made our photograph just

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.660 
eyeball off it made our photograph just
a<00:01:52.060> slight<00:01:52.450> bit<00:01:52.990> more<00:01:53.530> dramatic<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.460> black

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
a slight bit more dramatic on the black

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.719 
a slight bit more dramatic on the black
side<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.080> all<00:01:56.350> those<00:01:56.530> shadow<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.100> dark<00:01:57.340> areas

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
side and all those shadow and dark areas

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.789 
side and all those shadow and dark areas
in<00:01:57.760> our<00:01:57.970> photograph<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:59.440> now<00:01:59.530> we're<00:01:59.620> going<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
in our photograph so now we're going to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.250 
in our photograph so now we're going to
go<00:01:59.890> over<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.430> right<00:02:01.000> hand<00:02:01.270> side<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.750> press

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.289 
alt or option and click on the white
triangle<00:02:04.870> this<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.860> telling<00:02:06.159> us<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
triangle this is telling us that that

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.089 
triangle this is telling us that that
one<00:02:07.720> spot<00:02:08.170> right<00:02:08.319> there<00:02:08.530> which<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.769> probably

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
one spot right there which is probably

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.740 
one spot right there which is probably
just<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.399> specular<00:02:09.909> highlight<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.450> clouds

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
just a specular highlight in the clouds

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.680 
just a specular highlight in the clouds
is<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.799> whitest<00:02:12.459> white<00:02:12.849> portion<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.540> my

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
is the whitest white portion in my

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.750 
is the whitest white portion in my
photograph<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.349> if<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.500> move<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.950> over<00:02:15.129> just<00:02:15.580> a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
photograph so if I move this over just a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
photograph so if I move this over just a
slight<00:02:16.030> bit<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> left<00:02:16.810> I'm<00:02:17.049> gonna<00:02:17.200> start

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
slight bit to the left I'm gonna start

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.710 
slight bit to the left I'm gonna start
making<00:02:17.650> more<00:02:18.040> things<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.430> little

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
making more things a little

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.500 
making more things a little
lighter<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.800> photograph<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.360> I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
lighter in the photograph so now if I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.210 
lighter in the photograph so now if I
click<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.320> curves<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.070> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
click on the curves you can see that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.710 
click on the curves you can see that
we've<00:02:23.310> already<00:02:23.520> made<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.090> pretty<00:02:24.450> dramatic

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
we've already made a pretty dramatic

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680 
we've already made a pretty dramatic
photo<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.030> ahead<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> remove

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
photo here but if I go ahead and remove

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.510 
photo here but if I go ahead and remove
the<00:02:27.990> gradient<00:02:28.380> map<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.770> see<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.130> it's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the gradient map you can see that it's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.210 
the gradient map you can see that it's
doing<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.880> lot<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.330> my<00:02:30.600> photo<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> still<00:02:32.010> can

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
doing a lot to my photo but it still can

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.800 
doing a lot to my photo but it still can
go<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> little<00:02:32.580> bit<00:02:32.790> further<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.600> what<00:02:33.750> I'm

click on a dark portion of this grass

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.990 
click on a dark portion of this grass
because<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> don't<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.040> how<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.580> affected

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
because I don't like how it affected

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000 
because I don't like how it affected

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
slight bit to make that a little bit

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.870 
slight bit to make that a little bit
darker<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.170> now<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.160> gonna<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:11.820> up

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
darker so now I'm gonna do is just go up

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.730 
darker so now I'm gonna do is just go up
here<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.270> clouds<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.290> select<00:03:13.440> an

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
here to the clouds and just select an

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.340 
here to the clouds and just select an
area<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.490> white<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.630> has<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:16.260> bit

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
area that is white but has a little bit

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.260 
area that is white but has a little bit
of<00:03:16.470> detail<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:16.830> if<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.220> look<00:03:17.430> over<00:03:17.820> at<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
of detail so if you look over at the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.090 
of detail so if you look over at the
curve<00:03:18.600> I'm<00:03:18.900> looking<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:19.800> it's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
curve I'm looking at it now it's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.100 
curve I'm looking at it now it's
bouncing<00:03:20.550> around<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.120> moving<00:03:21.360> quite<00:03:22.080> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
bouncing around and it's moving quite a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.290 
bouncing around and it's moving quite a
mid<00:03:22.590> way<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.160> quadrant<00:03:23.700> click<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.269> and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
mid way to that quadrant click there and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.030 
mid way to that quadrant click there and
just<00:03:24.600> drag<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> little

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
just drag it up to make that a little

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.570 
just drag it up to make that a little
bit<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.660> brighter<00:03:27.860> alright<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.160> here<00:03:29.459> is

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
bit more brighter alright so here is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.770 
bit more brighter alright so here is
where<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> magic<00:03:30.000> happens<00:03:30.209> we've<00:03:30.600> got

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
where the magic happens we've got

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.180 
where the magic happens we've got
ourself<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.170> really<00:03:31.500> good<00:03:31.650> black<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.100> my

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
ourself a really good black in my

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.710 
ourself a really good black in my
photograph<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:32.850> now<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:33.150> click<00:03:33.510> off

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
photograph right now if we click off

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.150 
photograph right now if we click off
this<00:03:33.900> eyeball<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.560> see<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.830> we've<00:03:34.980> added

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
this eyeball we can see that we've added

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.550 
this eyeball we can see that we've added
a<00:03:35.340> lot<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.700> drama<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.510> lot<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.840> depth<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.380> our

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
a lot of drama and a lot of depth to our

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.710 
a lot of drama and a lot of depth to our
photograph<00:03:37.980> almost<00:03:38.850> immediately<00:03:39.300> with<00:03:39.540> that

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
photograph almost immediately with that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.840 
photograph almost immediately with that
really<00:03:40.019> quick<00:03:40.350> adjustment<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.489> remove

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
really quick adjustment so if I remove

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.090 
really quick adjustment so if I remove
the<00:03:42.090> eyeball<00:03:42.540> from<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> gradient<00:03:43.200> map<00:03:43.350> we'll

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the eyeball from the gradient map we'll

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.030 
the eyeball from the gradient map we'll
see<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.580> our<00:03:44.910> photograph<00:03:45.720> actually<00:03:46.680> looks<00:03:46.860> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
see that our photograph actually looks a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.270 
see that our photograph actually looks a
whole<00:03:47.310> lot<00:03:47.340> better<00:03:48.000> right<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:48.299> but<00:03:48.890> if<00:03:49.890> I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
whole lot better right now but if I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.910 
whole lot better right now but if I
don't<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> fact<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:52.290> curve

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
don't like the fact that that that curve

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.979 
don't like the fact that that that curve
is<00:03:53.130> affecting<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.670> color<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.269> can<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.810> down

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
is affecting the color I can go down

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.630 
is affecting the color I can go down
here<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.260> my<00:03:55.440> blending<00:03:55.890> options<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.459> click

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
here to my blending options and click

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.870 
here to my blending options and click
luminosity<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.720> only<00:03:58.410> affect<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.220> tones<00:03:59.519> in

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
luminosity and only affect the tones in

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.610 
luminosity and only affect the tones in
the<00:03:59.970> image<00:04:00.000> rather<00:04:00.660> than<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.080> colors<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.530> the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
the image rather than the colors in the

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220 
the image rather than the colors in the
image<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.519> actually<00:04:02.910> do<00:04:03.209> prefer<00:04:03.600> how<00:04:03.989> it's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
image now I actually do prefer how it's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.600 
image now I actually do prefer how it's
affecting<00:04:04.620> my<00:04:04.709> color<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.160> I'll<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.489> make

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
affecting my color so I'll just make

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
affecting my color so I'll just make
that<00:04:05.790> normal<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:07.380> from<00:04:07.590> here<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.040> could

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
that normal so from here I could

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160 
that normal so from here I could
actually<00:04:08.459> probably<00:04:09.090> stop<00:04:09.660> because<00:04:10.049> this

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
actually probably stop because this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.910 
actually probably stop because this
looks<00:04:10.380> pretty<00:04:10.560> good

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
looks pretty good

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.430 
looks pretty good
but<00:04:11.640> it's<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:12.060> not<00:04:12.180> enough<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
but it's just not enough so in the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.099 
but it's just not enough so in the
contrast<00:04:14.010> checker<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.640> also<00:04:15.120> added<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.780> Dodge

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
contrast checker I also added a Dodge

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.469 
contrast checker I also added a Dodge
and<00:04:16.380> burn<00:04:16.640> adjustment<00:04:17.640> layer<00:04:17.820> basically<00:04:18.419> an

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
and burn adjustment layer basically an

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.940 
and burn adjustment layer basically an
adjustment<00:04:18.840> layer<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.200> I've<00:04:19.320> created<00:04:19.560> if

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
adjustment layer that I've created if

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.219 
adjustment layer that I've created if
you<00:04:20.280> go<00:04:20.400> ahead<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.729> press<00:04:20.970> play<00:04:21.209> what<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
you go ahead and press play what that

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.440 
you go ahead and press play what that
does<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.800> it's<00:04:23.220> gonna<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:23.940> window<00:04:24.180> pop

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
does is it's gonna have this window pop

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.670 
does is it's gonna have this window pop
up<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.780> says<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:24.960> are<00:04:25.110> now<00:04:25.350> set<00:04:25.650> for

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
up and says you are now set for

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.620 
up and says you are now set for
non-destructive<00:04:26.310> dodging<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.150> burning

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
non-destructive dodging and burning

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.300 
non-destructive dodging and burning
now<00:04:27.810> there's<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.080> difference<00:04:28.650> destructive

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
now there's a difference destructive

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.440 
now there's a difference destructive
dodging<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.820> burning<00:04:29.850> would<00:04:30.120> be<00:04:30.240> if<00:04:30.330> you

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
dodging and burning would be if you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.820 
dodging and burning would be if you
grabbed<00:04:30.870> your<00:04:30.960> dodging<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.470> burning<00:04:31.500> tool

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
grabbed your dodging and burning tool

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.860 
grabbed your dodging and burning tool
just<00:04:32.070> went<00:04:32.190> right<00:04:32.490> away<00:04:32.640> onto<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.030> image<00:04:33.420> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
just went right away onto the image that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.900 
just went right away onto the image that
would<00:04:33.960> start<00:04:34.260> destroying<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.950> image<00:04:35.250> not

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
would start destroying the image not

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.370 
would start destroying the image not
instantly<00:04:36.210> destroying<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.050> leaves<00:04:37.230> a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
instantly destroying it but it leaves a

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.050 
instantly destroying it but it leaves a
permanent<00:04:37.650> mark<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.280> your<00:04:38.400> photograph

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
permanent mark on your photograph

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.660 
permanent mark on your photograph
whereas<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.230> layer<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:41.010> non-destructive

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
whereas this layer is a non-destructive

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.520 
whereas this layer is a non-destructive
dodging<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.330> brain<00:04:42.510> layer<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.440> it

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
dodging a brain layer so it

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.470 
dodging a brain layer so it
automatically<00:04:44.070> selects<00:04:44.610> your<00:04:44.730> dodge<00:04:44.940> tool<00:04:45.300> I

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
automatically selects your dodge tool I

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.820 
automatically selects your dodge tool I
always<00:04:45.810> start<00:04:46.050> with<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.230> Dodge<00:04:46.410> tool<00:04:46.740> it's

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
always start with the Dodge tool it's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.400 
always start with the Dodge tool it's
gonna<00:04:46.980> make<00:04:47.100> things<00:04:47.220> lighter<00:04:48.170> but<00:04:49.170> if<00:04:49.320> you

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
gonna make things lighter but if you

then<00:06:13.320> Dodge<00:06:13.560> Union<00:06:14.070> Station<00:06:14.520> here<00:06:14.640> because

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
then Dodge Union Station here because

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.090 
then Dodge Union Station here because
that<00:06:15.120> is<00:06:15.360> my<00:06:15.630> focal<00:06:16.020> point<00:06:16.230> so<00:06:16.440> if<00:06:16.500> I<00:06:16.590> dodge<00:06:16.860> it

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
that is my focal point so if I dodge it

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.130 
that is my focal point so if I dodge it
make<00:06:17.280> it<00:06:17.400> lighter<00:06:17.700> it<00:06:18.210> automatically<00:06:18.810> becomes

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
make it lighter it automatically becomes

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.650 
make it lighter it automatically becomes
brighter<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.800> right<00:06:20.790> in<00:06:21.030> your<00:06:21.210> face<00:06:21.450> like

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
brighter and right in your face like

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.750 
brighter and right in your face like
that<00:06:21.900> so<00:06:22.140> that's<00:06:22.680> kind<00:06:23.340> of<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.490> effect<00:06:23.730> that

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
that so that's kind of the effect that

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.840 
that so that's kind of the effect that
I'm<00:06:23.910> going<00:06:24.090> for<00:06:24.330> there<00:06:24.920> so<00:06:25.920> again<00:06:26.310> I<00:06:26.490> had<00:06:26.730> it

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
I'm going for there so again I had it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.340 
I'm going for there so again I had it
more<00:06:27.000> def<00:06:27.330> so<00:06:27.600> let's<00:06:27.720> look<00:06:27.780> at<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.020> beginning

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
more def so let's look at the beginning

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.250 
more def so let's look at the beginning
this<00:06:28.860> is<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.130> before<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.760> this<00:06:30.540> is<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:31.080> after

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
this is the before and this is the after

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.580 
this is the before and this is the after
now<00:06:32.190> this<00:06:32.970> whole<00:06:33.270> tutorial<00:06:33.750> took<00:06:34.140> me<00:06:34.260> 6

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
now this whole tutorial took me 6

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.740 
now this whole tutorial took me 6
minutes<00:06:34.920> and<00:06:35.190> 30<00:06:35.820> seconds<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.720> do<00:06:36.900> at<00:06:37.260> this

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
minutes and 30 seconds to do at this

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.720 
minutes and 30 seconds to do at this
and<00:06:38.020> if<00:06:38.350> I<00:06:38.440> wasn't<00:06:38.920> teaching<00:06:39.070> this<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.580> you<00:06:39.670> if

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
and if I wasn't teaching this to you if

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.070 
and if I wasn't teaching this to you if
I<00:06:39.790> wasn't<00:06:40.000> talking<00:06:40.540> you<00:06:40.630> through<00:06:40.810> this<00:06:40.900> you

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
I wasn't talking you through this you

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.750 
I wasn't talking you through this you
can<00:06:41.230> see<00:06:41.440> that<00:06:41.620> you<00:06:41.770> could<00:06:41.950> have<00:06:42.070> created<00:06:42.550> this

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
can see that you could have created this

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.570 
can see that you could have created this
same<00:06:43.120> aspect<00:06:44.050> on<00:06:44.170> your<00:06:44.350> photograph<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:45.040> much

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
same aspect on your photograph and much

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.460 
same aspect on your photograph and much
less<00:06:46.000> time<00:06:46.390> because<00:06:46.780> you're<00:06:46.930> not<00:06:46.960> talking

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
less time because you're not talking

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.370 
less time because you're not talking
about<00:06:47.530> it<00:06:47.680> you're<00:06:47.950> just<00:06:48.100> doing<00:06:48.520> it<00:06:48.670> so<00:06:48.820> what<00:06:49.660> at

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
about it you're just doing it so what at

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.630 
about it you're just doing it so what at
the<00:06:50.560> beginning<00:06:50.920> it<00:06:51.160> might<00:06:51.310> be<00:06:51.430> kind<00:06:51.610> of

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
the beginning it might be kind of

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.550 
the beginning it might be kind of
difficult<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:52.270> get<00:06:52.420> that<00:06:52.570> trained<00:06:52.930> eye<00:06:53.140> to<00:06:53.200> see

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
difficult to get that trained eye to see

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.410 
difficult to get that trained eye to see
that<00:06:53.740> this<00:06:53.980> is<00:06:54.160> not<00:06:54.340> necessarily<00:06:54.880> a<00:06:55.150> great

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
that this is not necessarily a great

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.350 
that this is not necessarily a great
black-and-white<00:06:56.080> photograph<00:06:56.760> but<00:06:57.760> once<00:06:58.240> you

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
black-and-white photograph but once you

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.640 
black-and-white photograph but once you
start<00:06:58.570> using<00:06:58.810> those<00:06:58.990> clippings<00:06:59.410> and<00:06:59.590> you

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
start using those clippings and you

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.080 
start using those clippings and you
start<00:06:59.860> understanding<00:07:00.130> those<00:07:00.460> clippings<00:07:00.700> and

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
start understanding those clippings and

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.120 
start understanding those clippings and
knowing<00:07:01.660> that<00:07:01.810> this<00:07:02.080> is<00:07:02.350> a<00:07:02.410> good<00:07:02.710> black<00:07:02.950> and

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
knowing that this is a good black and

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.440 
knowing that this is a good black and
white<00:07:03.220> photograph<00:07:03.580> because<00:07:03.910> of<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.150> depth

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
white photograph because of the depth

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.540 
white photograph because of the depth
there's<00:07:04.990> white<00:07:05.320> and<00:07:05.530> there's<00:07:05.950> black<00:07:06.310> and

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
there's white and there's black and

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.370 
there's white and there's black and
there's<00:07:06.730> a<00:07:06.850> smooth<00:07:07.330> gradation<00:07:07.750> in<00:07:08.050> between

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
there's a smooth gradation in between

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.780 
there's a smooth gradation in between
just<00:07:08.830> like<00:07:08.920> I<00:07:09.130> discussed<00:07:09.550> in<00:07:09.670> the<00:07:09.760> article

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
just like I discussed in the article

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.820 
just like I discussed in the article

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
where you start getting good regular

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.910 
where you start getting good regular
