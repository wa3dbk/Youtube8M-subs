00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.430
 hello everyone welcome to an episode 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.830
 more here in drawing and creating that you 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.410
 speaks of milton core and today 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.770
 let's make a labrador dog is a 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.629
 puppy dog ​​labrador puppy and good 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.980
 then the way to do it is first 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.470
 doing the embedded what is the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.570
 initial sketch of the puppy we should 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.980
 fit rather the parts like the face 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.369
 is mining a bit of profile a bit 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.810
 side of sketch then sometimes those 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.849
 forms are a bit difficult then what 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.380
 well what we should do is look at the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.599
 things in 3-d look at things with 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.020
 perspective and do an embedded like 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.399
 as rectangular of the form then 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.649
 so it would be much easier for us 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.170
 says how often what we do is 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.270
 apply the shadows the parts that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.100
 they go of shadows we are growing the and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.860
 let's leave the illuminated parts the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.960
 parts that go of light then 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.060
 then what is most melting 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.920
 that graphite I did it here with the help 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.270
 of the blur but it is recommended that 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.380
 do not do it with the same diffuses the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.760
 video do not do it with the blurred 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.190
 do it with toilet paper with a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.570
 napkin because then he will do more 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.100
 easy to detach the pencil with the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.630
 draft on what we are doing this 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 moment we are giving defining too 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.290
 the parts the lights with the eraser 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.030
 deformable then better do it with 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 napkin or with toilet paper not 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.330
 do with him in that first step not what 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.610
 do with the blurs the say me not what 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.380
 we will use when we already need 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.390
 render the code and when we invite 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.860
 make some shadows but they will stay 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.990
 more fixed in the drawing we do not need 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 erase them then those parts the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.830
 we can make content because he 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.450
 blurred paste more graphite to the paper 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.030
 and what it does is make it more difficult 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 erase what we then begin to 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.570
 start in this way I want to put 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.149
 in slow speed is the way to go 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.280
 making each of the hairs of the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.899
 puppy like that is done with the wolves with 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 the tigers with the leopards good with 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.770
 all animals have to do it 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.990
 so hair for hair ok then for 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.180
 render these hairs of dogs 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.970
 I'm using this prism this 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.980
 prismacolor that I have this pencil comes 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.900
 being more or less 14 I see 15 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.490
 I am using it for the zones 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.200
 dark for the darker hairs of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.870
 the dark areas and also for the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.190
 dark hairs for medium hairs 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.369
 I'm using this which is a 2p pencil 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.190
 with a little lighter and for the zones 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.500
 clearer then I'm using a 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.820
 pencil ok ok if you are the one to give a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.740
 little more detail to the parties more 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.620
 clear and a little more realism too 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.170
 you can add a 2h pencil that is still 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.230
 clearer then we continue throughout 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.570
 the process then already the pencils that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.920
 I told you guys you identify the areas 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.780
 more clearly identify the most 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.700
 dark and they are using each of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 those pencils for for each month to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.600
 each area for every need ok 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 then the way to do it was born expert 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.230
 by straight shape straight hair 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.910
 when the experts go curved 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.590
 - and with some part then we must 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.150
 take that form we should do it from 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.850
 According curved shape curved shape 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.230
 expert per pelito ok is a process of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.570
 patience because it does not really delay 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.880
 a lot really is quite the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.620
 process will take much longer as 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.420
 you want more realism if you want to say 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.950
 much more realistic then you do it more 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 slowly you do it 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.209
 more detail and he had to do much more 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.489
 realistic the isaac render shape and the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.010
 nose is to apply layers first we apply 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.750
 a soft layer of a gray hue 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.209
 we merged it with the blurred 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.550
 we apply a darker layer where I go 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.920
 darker we blur it and then 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.290
 we apply the darker areas again 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 bony then we do it pretty much 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.560
 three layers with the three layers that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.049
 let's do that way we're winning 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.810
 realism in our drawings ok here 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.060
 then again I put them in shape 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.830
 slow for you to see how 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.890
 something every little hair every little bit of shape 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.400
 slow ok and that's the way to 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.890
 render these furry animals 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.840
 so then we continue with the other 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.200
 We interviewed him, we helped him with the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 blurred we also started these 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.829
 puppies from the sides of the eyes are 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.000
 dark then we do it with the pencil 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.910
 4b 5b and on the facebook page les 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.220
 placed the original image of this 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 puppy but there are many many 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.090
 images of Labrador retrievers 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.920
 google and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.660
 of all very important is the technique that 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.099
 I am explaining to you here ok in this 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.200
 part there are also some hairs that are 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.640
 whites and in that part, I did it with 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.830
 a draft a normal draft 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.190
 simply what I did was to pass or 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.440
 be cut to cut the sheet and use 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.850
 the figure part ok and finally we do 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.229
 what are the high lights these lights 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.419
 high since I'm doing it with a 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.030
 brush number 1 and with acrylic paint 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.260
 ok for high lights and the rest of the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 high lights we are doing with the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.729
 deformable eraser in this way let's 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.050
 defining the high lights we're going 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.560
 reinforcing a little if necessary 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.180
 also reinforce the areas 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.919
 dark with pencil we also do it ok 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.030
 is the final result I hope that you 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.740
 I liked it, I hope you have learned 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.770
 and leave all the questions you want 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.440
 please share what please leave

 you are not subscribed to the channel for many 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.360
 more tutorials and for many more videos 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.380
 ok we'll see each other in the next one 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.380
 super good bye
