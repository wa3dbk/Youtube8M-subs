was<00:00:48.420> unknown<00:00:48.989> how<00:00:49.379> weak<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:50.040> acacia<00:00:50.399> was

right<00:00:51.540> next<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.049> but<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:53.100> mighty<00:00:53.430> winds

the<00:00:54.150> failure<00:00:54.540> occurred<00:00:54.930> came<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.769> and<00:00:56.010> tore

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:56.189 
the failure occurred came down and tore

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.520 
the failure occurred came down and tore
out<00:00:56.369> some<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.210> primary<00:00:57.720> important

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
out some very primary important

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.710 
out some very primary important
structural<00:00:58.949> limbs<00:00:59.220> out<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.580> this<00:00:59.699> tree<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
structural limbs out of this tree this

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.689 
structural limbs out of this tree this
could<00:01:00.989> even<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.259> said<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.650> be<00:01:01.680> death<00:01:02.220> injuries

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
could even be said to be death injuries

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
could even be said to be death injuries
so<00:01:03.390> we're<00:01:03.689> not<00:01:03.809> sure<00:01:03.869> about<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> yet<00:01:04.739> we're

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so we're not sure about that yet we're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
so we're not sure about that yet we're
gonna<00:01:05.489> treat<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> wounds<00:01:06.509> we're<00:01:06.630> going

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
gonna treat all the wounds we're going

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
gonna treat all the wounds we're going
to<00:01:06.900> recut<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.009> just<00:01:08.759> see<00:01:08.880> if

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to recut some of them and just see if

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.100 
to recut some of them and just see if
the<00:01:09.119> tree<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> good

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the tree is going to have a good

the tree is going to have a good
response<00:01:11.180> big<00:01:12.180> cuts<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.750> difficult<00:01:13.530> for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
response big cuts are very difficult for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
response big cuts are very difficult for
citrus<00:01:14.040> trees<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> heal<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:15.000> tear<00:01:15.869> on

citrus trees to heal and tear on
injuries<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> even<00:01:17.009> worse<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> tear<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
injuries are even worse this tear out is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.950 
injuries are even worse this tear out is
about<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> foot<00:01:19.680> long<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.450> from<00:01:21.450> three<00:01:21.810> inches

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
wide a very very long injury very

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
wide a very very long injury very
difficult<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> tree<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> cope<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.789> an

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
difficult for the tree to cope with an

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.169 
difficult for the tree to cope with an
injury<00:01:30.179> like<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.710> if<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.979> does<00:01:32.219> close<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
injury like this if it does close this

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.510 
injury like this if it does close this
would<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.659> decades<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.499> just<00:01:34.829> years<00:01:35.219> but

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
would take decades not just years but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.379 
would take decades not just years but
decades<00:01:35.969> to<00:01:36.299> close<00:01:36.569> it<00:01:37.380> may<00:01:37.590> never<00:01:37.799> close<00:01:38.389> so

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
decades to close it may never close so

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:41.749 
decades to close it may never close so
we<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.109> to<00:01:40.200> slow<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.710> decay<00:01:41.130> process

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
we want to slow down the decay process

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
we want to slow down the decay process
slow<00:01:42.539> down<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.049> possibility<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
slow down the possibility of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
slow down the possibility of
catastrophic<00:01:44.399> emboli<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
catastrophic emboli we don't want the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.510 
catastrophic emboli we don't want the
tree<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.469> a<00:01:46.499> gasp<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.100> air<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.429> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
tree to get a gasp of air in the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.940 
tree to get a gasp of air in the
vascular<00:01:48.030> system<00:01:48.179> so<00:01:48.959> we've<00:01:49.200> painted<00:01:49.469> this<00:01:49.709> in

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
vascular system so we've painted this in

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.429 
vascular system so we've painted this in
grain<00:01:50.219> with<00:01:50.939> our<00:01:51.090> compound<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.899> orange<00:01:52.229> rind

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

oil<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:52.889> beeswax<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.670> we've<00:01:54.569> cleaned<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
oil and beeswax and we've cleaned the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.169 
oil and beeswax and we've cleaned the
wound<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.369> serious<00:01:56.789> injuries

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
wound up these are very serious injuries

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.969 
wound up these are very serious injuries
these<00:01:57.389> could<00:01:57.929> even<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.259> said<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.679> death

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
these could even be said to be death

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.879 
these could even be said to be death
wounds<00:01:59.509> if<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.780> were<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.170> wound<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
wounds if there were one wound like this

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.319 
wounds if there were one wound like this
on<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.130> tree<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.819> bad<00:02:02.999> enough<00:02:03.270> but

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
on the tree it would be bad enough but

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
on the tree it would be bad enough but
there's<00:02:03.749> about<00:02:03.869> five<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:05.279> the<00:02:05.399> failure<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there's about five from the failure of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
there's about five from the failure of
the<00:02:05.939> acacia<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.499> this<00:02:07.740> failure<00:02:07.979> could<00:02:08.280> have

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the acacia so if this failure could have

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.770 
the acacia so if this failure could have
been<00:02:08.490> predicted<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.300> could<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.660> been

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
been predicted it could have been
