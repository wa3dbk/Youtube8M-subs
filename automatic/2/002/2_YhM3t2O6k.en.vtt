00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
Underground and so the description of

Underground and so the description of
that<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.149> buried<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.260> upon<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that is in buried be there upon so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.619 
that is in buried be there upon so
that's<00:00:56.460> pretty<00:00:56.610> interesting<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.570> know

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that's pretty interesting I don't know

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.270 
that's pretty interesting I don't know
what<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> means<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.590> probably<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.190> something

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
what it means it probably has something

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.720 
what it means it probably has something
to<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> easter<00:01:01.050> egg<00:01:01.170> i<00:01:01.289> would<00:01:01.410> assume

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
to do with the easter egg i would assume

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080 
to do with the easter egg i would assume
the<00:01:02.730> next<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.769> ectoplasmic<00:01:04.769> residue<00:01:05.090> in

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the next one is ectoplasmic residue in

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
the next one is ectoplasmic residue in
buried<00:01:06.570> acquire<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> perk<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.590> free<00:01:08.299> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
buried acquire a perk for free so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
buried acquire a perk for free so
there's<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:10.170> some<00:01:10.799> way<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.189> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there's probably some way to get a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.800 
there's probably some way to get a
perfect<00:01:11.430> well<00:01:11.850> obviously<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:12.780> way

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
perfect well obviously there is some way

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
perfect well obviously there is some way
to<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> perk<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.380> free<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:14.760> know

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
to get a perk for free but I don't know

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
to get a perk for free but I don't know
how<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> might<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.409> something<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> do

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
how that might also have something to do

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.980 
how that might also have something to do
with<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.310> easter<00:01:17.610> egg<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.479> might<00:01:18.720> be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
with the easter egg or it might be

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.929 
with the easter egg or it might be
something<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:20.009> easy<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.460> i<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.850> know

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
locker so that confirms that the bank

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.080

and<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.350> weapon<00:02:26.740> locker<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.340> back<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.940> this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and the weapon locker is back on this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.390 
and the weapon locker is back on this
next<00:02:28.330> map<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.960> they<00:02:29.530> did<00:02:29.710> add<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.160> die

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
next map and they did add it in to die

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.370 
next map and they did add it in to die
rise<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.210> think<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:31.750> they're<00:02:31.870> doing<00:02:31.930> is

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
rise so I think what they're doing is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.680 
rise so I think what they're doing is
adding<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.890> into<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.790> maps<00:02:34.030> where

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
adding that into all of the maps where

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.930 
adding that into all of the maps where
the<00:02:35.050> transit<00:02:35.680> characters<00:02:36.130> are<00:02:36.400> present

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the transit characters are present

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.620 
the transit characters are present

there's<00:03:06.280> apparently<00:03:07.090> amazed<00:03:07.750> uh<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:11.170> no

revolution comes in Barry to return to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.640 
revolution comes in Barry to return to
processing<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.170> seems<00:03:35.350> pretty

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
processing so that seems pretty

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
processing so that seems pretty
interesting<00:03:36.190> once<00:03:36.370> again<00:03:36.730> kind<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.390> similar

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
interesting once again kind of similar

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.390 
interesting once again kind of similar
to<00:03:37.780> call<00:03:38.050> of<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.350> day<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.650> mob<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.130> dead<00:03:39.250> i

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
to call of the day a mob of the dead i

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.300 
to call of the day a mob of the dead i
mean<00:03:39.760> there's<00:03:40.630> two<00:03:40.989> achievements<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:42.040> kind

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
mean there's two achievements that kind

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
mean there's two achievements that kind
of<00:03:42.400> sound<00:03:42.700> like<00:03:42.880> they<00:03:43.030> might<00:03:43.270> have<00:03:43.540> something

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
of sound like they might have something

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.050 
of sound like they might have something
to<00:03:43.900> do<00:03:44.050> with<00:03:44.170> these<00:03:44.290> stray<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.880> the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
to do with these stray when the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.530 
to do with these stray when the
revolution<00:03:46.690> comes<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.380> mind<00:03:47.770> games<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.360> yeah

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
revolution comes and mind games so yeah

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.449 
revolution comes and mind games so yeah
mind<00:03:49.930> games<00:03:50.110> i'm<00:03:50.380> assuming<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.830> probably<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
mind games i'm assuming is probably the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.570 
mind games i'm assuming is probably the
bigger<00:03:51.730> easter<00:03:52.510> egg<00:03:53.160> achievement<00:03:54.160> because

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
bigger easter egg achievement because

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.630 
bigger easter egg achievement because
it's<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.180> their<00:03:55.420> pawn<00:03:56.010> which<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.160> kind<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.459> what

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
it's be their pawn which is kind of what

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.729 
it's be their pawn which is kind of what
you're<00:03:57.790> doing<00:03:57.820> in<00:03:58.300> all<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.050> older<00:03:59.440> maps

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
you're doing in all of the older maps

being<00:04:06.850> their<00:04:07.000> pawn<00:04:07.470> yeah<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.650> as<00:04:08.770> we<00:04:08.950> know<00:04:09.130> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
being their pawn yeah and as we know the

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.710 
being their pawn yeah and as we know the
zombies<00:04:09.790> eyes<00:04:09.880> are<00:04:10.060> blue<00:04:10.209> again<00:04:10.420> so

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
zombies eyes are blue again so

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.300 
zombies eyes are blue again so
Richthofen<00:04:11.320> is<00:04:11.410> in<00:04:11.590> control<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.040> we're<00:04:12.160> back

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
Richthofen is in control and we're back

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.010 
Richthofen is in control and we're back
to<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.580> normal<00:04:12.790> cast<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.180> characters<00:04:13.600> so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
to the normal cast of characters so

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.110 
to the normal cast of characters so
we're<00:04:14.140> back<00:04:14.290> in<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.650> time<00:04:15.040> era<00:04:15.510> um

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.390 

yeah<00:04:20.120> they're<00:04:20.900> they're<00:04:21.170> all<00:04:21.440> bronze<00:04:21.860> trophies

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
yeah they're they're all bronze trophies

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.830 
yeah they're they're all bronze trophies
except<00:04:22.760> for<00:04:22.940> mind<00:04:23.150> games<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.600> I'm<00:04:23.720> assuming

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
except for mind games so I'm assuming

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.830 
except for mind games so I'm assuming
that<00:04:24.260> one<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.620> big<00:04:24.770> Easter<00:04:25.100> egg<00:04:25.160> one<00:04:25.370> but

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
that one is the big Easter egg one but

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.750 
that one is the big Easter egg one but
when<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.020> revolution<00:04:27.650> comes<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.310> think<00:04:28.340> that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
when the revolution comes I think that

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.720 
when the revolution comes I think that
probably<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:30.260> part<00:04:30.620> probably<00:04:30.890> smaller

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
probably as is part probably smaller

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.980 
probably as is part probably smaller
part<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> easter<00:04:32.480> egg<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.250> yeah<00:04:34.990> that's

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
part of the easter egg so yeah that's

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.930 
part of the easter egg so yeah that's
the<00:04:36.260> mind<00:04:37.220> games<00:04:37.400> probably<00:04:37.730> gonna<00:04:37.820> be<00:04:37.910> about

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
the mind games probably gonna be about

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.750 
the mind games probably gonna be about
