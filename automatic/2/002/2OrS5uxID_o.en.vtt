 white but you could also use the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.079
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.079

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.329

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.099
 this is your time to shine this time 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.539
 to create 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.520
 then just put it in the freezer to 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.799
 stay well tough and perfect for 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.959
 people eat then take the freezer to 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.819
 We'll get this chocolate various 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.559
 small pieces to get easier 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.559
 because this very big match 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.670
 Good people, according to the recipe 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.280
 chocolate has to be white because the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.260
 people will make it colorful and black 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.210
 It was not going to work, I bought one with 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.160
 some color food colorants 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.890
 that I then mixed it with 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.890
 leave because I wanted to and it's simpler 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.900
 after that you'll put in the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.030
 Easter egg dish is famous for 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.560
 I'm done now 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.240
 wait a little bit of each color inside 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 shape and the Easter egg and with the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.650
 help from a spoon we will mix 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.790
 and will put everything cute on the wall 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.400
 thus 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.680
 you can see that the texture of the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.480
 my chocolate is a bit strange and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.760
 I do not know why it happened I think it's 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.740
 because of the dye or because of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.750
 way I should have mixed then the 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.920
 tip carefully mix calmly 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.550
 because I mixed a little with 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.930
 hurry but it was not was not a thing 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.209
 It was not a bad thing that we were 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.690
 any project not actually helped me 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.000
 at the time of knotting on the egg part 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.190
 The same way Easter was left 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.360

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.519

 I had a lot of fun

 as often as things seem 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.209
 who are going to give a ditch in the end 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.739

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.780
