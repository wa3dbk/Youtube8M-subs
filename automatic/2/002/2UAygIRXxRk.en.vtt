00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.180
 cyber valves access today I want 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.340
 talk about the game wii party ue for the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 Nintendo Wii It's a game released in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 shop on October 25, 2013 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.820
 in north america nintendo and experts 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.010
 to design family games and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 in wii party ue but we aim to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.250
 bring the players together in front of the TV for 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 a fun atmosphere 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 the title features 80 mini-games and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.240
 some interesting modes I find that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 it looks like mario party in a fact 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.150
 it's logical because it's the same 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 team took care of its development 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.460
 the first mode offers games of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 company for in has four players for 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 gain advantage by playing 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.850
 mini games very low gentlemen simon 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 found a board game whose goal 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 is to get to the end of some of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 hundreds of cars and the number of ten and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 that the choice to revive var is 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 determined each round with a mini 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 game so the most interesting part 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.910
 rest and of course the minutes that goes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.340
 to be fun too very addictive 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 found games where for example 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.820
 press the right button the most 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.650
 quickly possible 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 when you monday shot also 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 memorize by fruits put in a pot 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.580
 for parents only when a cook 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 sorry the games on offer are really 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.200
 for all families no matter 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.720
 your age a point emphasized that limit 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 jules can be earned according to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.610
 reflexes of the player but some here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.689
 can be can be the work of the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.670
 chance I specify the example the pseudo 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.799
 card games that brings together or a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.110
 poker game 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.869
 the second game mode is called jude 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.979
 living room and but the gamepad featured in 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.470
 different situations 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.079
 for example one of the games offers at 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 player who has the gamepad to perform the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.159
 same facial expression they see 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 on relative fears while the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.149
 other players sees his face from on 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740
 the TV screen so they have to the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.119
 find 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 how to express what expression 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.159
 precisely the player is in the process of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.950
 reproduce and we also find others 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 concepts a little bit different like 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.509
 a kind of pictionary that we can 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.950
 find and also note that this mode 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290
 can not play alone 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.420
 you have to be two to four players 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.310
 the third mode is called games of 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 table is a mode that plays two 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.750
 players who are fighting each other using the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.430
 gamepad only each player stands 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.930
 on each side of the gamepad and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.209
 compete at the same time in 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.200
 different mini sports games on 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.200
 the tablet screen what's how i 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.079
 proceeds here that we can play as a 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.790
 part of foosball or also played a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.889
 baseball game 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.120
 it's still pretty rustic but 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.909
 It's really interesting 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.400
 we also find mini games like 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.260
 labyrinths also there are 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.659
 Here a 2 mode that allows players 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.930
 participate in quick challenges two mini 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.970
 games 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.209
 it's something that I have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.400
 a little less explored so yes a 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.620
 slope and you propose mini games that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.239
 are fun in all the mini 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.310
 games are quite varied proposes 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.139
 several ways to play that are 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.790
 accessible to people of all ages 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.290
 which is a pity on the other hand is that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.310
 I have it much less interesting 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 when alone 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.400
 especially since there is no possibility of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.340
 To play online 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.129
 so I give the rating of 7 out of 10 ha yes 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.209
 portal where it was his bastille thank you 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.209
 and have fun
