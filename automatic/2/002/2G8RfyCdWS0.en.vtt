00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
there now we move it into the second off

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
anything so yeah we won that game we

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.150 
anything so yeah we won that game we
didn't<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.230> three<00:02:16.500> points<00:02:16.890> which<00:02:17.040> are

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
didn't get three points which are
already<00:02:17.280> expected<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.240> hopefully<00:02:18.990> they<00:02:19.140> will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
already expected but hopefully they will

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.840 
already expected but hopefully they will
they<00:02:19.620> will<00:02:19.770> count<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> future<00:02:20.550> because

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
they will count in the future because

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.309 
they will count in the future because
that<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.270> happened<00:02:21.600> when<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.110> were

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
little bit unlucky then I just before of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.069 
little bit unlucky then I just before of
time<00:03:41.790> its<00:03:41.970> Mattias<00:03:42.150> phenomenas<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.049> a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
time its Mattias phenomenas that with a

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.349 
time its Mattias phenomenas that with a
lovely<00:03:43.530> bola<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.950> victory<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.579> once<00:03:44.940> again<00:03:45.120> we

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
lovely bola to victory but once again we

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.180 
lovely bola to victory but once again we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
did get a shortened but I think it was

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.160 
did get a shortened but I think it was
nori<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:47.970> safe<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.480> yeah<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.989> picked

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
nori that what is safe so yeah we picked

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.440 
nori that what is safe so yeah we picked
up<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.350> corner<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.980> 45th<00:03:50.519> minute<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:51.060> guess

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
up a corner in the 45th minute and guess

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.270 
up a corner in the 45th minute and guess

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
see from the replay we go in a bit of a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.320 
see from the replay we go in a bit of a
bit<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.010> flare<00:04:35.280> paths<00:04:35.550> there<00:04:35.729> into<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> back

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
bit of a flare paths there into the back

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.480 
bit of a flare paths there into the back
of<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:36.600> net<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.930> make<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.320> 3-1<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.010> pretty

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
of the net to make it 3-1 and pretty

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.939 
of the net to make it 3-1 and pretty
much<00:04:38.669> make<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.090> game<00:04:39.419> over<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.199> yeah<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.860> is

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
much make it game over so yeah that is

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.140 
much make it game over so yeah that is
pretty<00:04:41.010> much<00:04:41.280> hard<00:04:41.520> at<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:41.699> game<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.060> it's

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
pretty much hard at the game and it's

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.659 
pretty much hard at the game and it's
won<00:04:42.360> 3-1<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:43.020> guess<00:04:43.500> we<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:44.040> deserved<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.460> win

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
won 3-1 I guess we we deserved that win

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.490 
won 3-1 I guess we we deserved that win
even<00:04:45.090> though<00:04:45.210> my<00:04:45.360> opponent<00:04:45.810> also<00:04:45.900> had<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> lot

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
even though my opponent also had a lot

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.469 
even though my opponent also had a lot
of<00:04:46.530> chances<00:04:47.040> but<00:04:47.220> anyway<00:04:47.669> we<00:04:48.150> picked<00:04:48.389> up

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
of chances but anyway we picked up

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.030 
of chances but anyway we picked up
another<00:04:48.720> three<00:04:49.020> points<00:04:49.380> which<00:04:49.560> means<00:04:49.830> we

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
another three points which means we

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.920 
another three points which means we
should<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.610> 12<00:04:51.000> points<00:04:51.300> right<00:04:51.419> now<00:04:51.479> so<00:04:51.780> that

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
should be on 12 points right now so that

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.150 
should be on 12 points right now so that
means<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.199> we<00:04:52.320> can't<00:04:52.530> really<00:04:52.710> relegate

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
means that we can't really relegate

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.920 
means that we can't really relegate
anymore<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.760> know<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.240> doesn't<00:04:54.389> show<00:04:54.630> up<00:04:54.780> but

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
anymore I know it doesn't show up but

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.719 
anymore I know it doesn't show up but
that's<00:04:55.440> because<00:04:55.650> Ultimate<00:04:56.220> Team<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.490> really

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
that's because Ultimate Team is really

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.950 
that's because Ultimate Team is really
really<00:04:56.880> glitchy<00:04:57.120> which<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:57.540> pretty<00:04:57.720> annoying

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
really glitchy which is pretty annoying

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.230 
really glitchy which is pretty annoying
but<00:04:58.110> anyway<00:04:58.470> we<00:04:58.919> move<00:04:59.460> on<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.669> decided<00:05:00.000> to

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
but anyway we move on I decided to

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.270 
but anyway we move on I decided to
switch<00:05:00.570> teams<00:05:01.050> because<00:05:01.410> Michael<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:02.130> do

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
switch teams because Michael and I do

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.310 
switch teams because Michael and I do
believe<00:05:02.520> our<00:05:02.699> roto<00:05:02.880> were<00:05:03.180> both<00:05:03.479> injured<00:05:04.050> so

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
believe our roto were both injured so

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.170 
believe our roto were both injured so
yeah<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:04.860> move<00:05:05.070> on<00:05:05.220> into<00:05:05.430> another<00:05:05.760> game<00:05:05.940> and

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
yeah we move on into another game and

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.879 
yeah we move on into another game and
now<00:05:06.750> we<00:05:06.810> came<00:05:06.990> up<00:05:07.080> against<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.440> really<00:05:07.650> really

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
now we came up against a really really

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.170 
now we came up against a really really

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
really early on into the game so he

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.590 
really early on into the game so he
steps<00:05:19.800> up<00:05:19.979> first<00:05:20.220> with<00:05:20.400> Ronaldo<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:21.330> he<00:05:21.449> makes

yet<00:06:17.070> again<00:06:17.340> went<00:06:17.550> to<00:06:17.610> court<00:06:17.760> Rada<00:06:17.940> which<00:06:18.180> i

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
yet again went to court Rada which i

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.360

think<00:06:18.360> is<00:06:18.660> this<00:06:18.780> vertical<00:06:19.500> so<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.010> that<00:06:20.190> means

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
think is this vertical so and that means

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.070 
think is this vertical so and that means
we<00:06:20.580> are<00:06:20.699> we<00:06:20.820> completely<00:06:21.210> set<00:06:21.570> records<00:06:21.960> here

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080
