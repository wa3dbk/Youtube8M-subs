playability and comfort style and as you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.289 
playability and comfort style and as you
can<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.650> since<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.180> whole

can see since as you can see the whole

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.710 
can see since as you can see the whole

boom<00:01:28.020> itself<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.750> gives<00:01:30.750> even<00:01:31.229> more

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
boom itself so that gives even more

earlier the video the headset on the end
of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> wire<00:02:35.670> had<00:02:36.060> two<00:02:36.900> little<00:02:37.050> black<00:02:37.380> prongs

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
of the wire had two little black prongs

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.479 
of the wire had two little black prongs
sticking<00:02:38.190> next<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.360> silver<00:02:40.019> one<00:02:40.489> those

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
sticking next to the silver one those

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.520 
sticking next to the silver one those
two<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:41.910> black<00:02:42.150> prongs<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:45.530> there

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
two little black prongs go right there

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.320 
two little black prongs go right there
and<00:02:47.420> there<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.830> main<00:02:50.070> one<00:02:50.370> goes<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
and there and the main one goes in the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.580 
and there and the main one goes in the
middle<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.800> i'll<00:02:53.130> show<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.760> that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
middle so i'll show you how to do that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060 
middle so i'll show you how to do that
you<00:02:55.590> line<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.860> all<00:02:56.130> up<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.590> kind<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.799> hard

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
you line it all up see it's kind of hard

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.460 
you line it all up see it's kind of hard
because<00:02:59.190> only<00:02:59.700> i'm<00:03:00.090> only<00:03:00.239> using<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.630> hand

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.680 

plug<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.570> seeing<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
plug it in like that and seeing the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.330 
plug it in like that and seeing the
reason<00:03:06.989> why<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.200> controls<00:03:07.769> are<00:03:07.950> at<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> end

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
reason why the controls are at the end

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.400 
reason why the controls are at the end
of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.549> wires<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.110> they're<00:03:10.110> only<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
of the wires because they're only a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640 
of the wires because they're only a
thumbs<00:03:10.769> reach<00:03:11.070> away<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.570> can<00:03:12.870> get

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
thumbs reach away so you can get

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.280 
thumbs reach away so you can get

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
knob on this particular headset is that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.370 
knob on this particular headset is that
it<00:03:24.209> tells<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.930> which<00:03:25.829> way<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.220> outer<00:03:26.640> and

it tells you which way is outer and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.370 
it tells you which way is outer and
which<00:03:28.380> way<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:29.180> makes<00:03:30.180> less<00:03:30.450> sound<00:03:30.720> see<00:03:31.140> up<00:03:31.290> a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
which way is makes less sound see up a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.759 
which way is makes less sound see up a
plus<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.890> minus<00:03:32.070> on<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.880> wheel<00:03:33.769> that's

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
plus and the minus on the wheel that's

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.200 
plus and the minus on the wheel that's
pretty<00:03:35.070> cool<00:03:36.440> see<00:03:37.440> an<00:03:37.620> accord

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
pretty cool see an accord

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.900 
pretty cool see an accord
over<00:03:39.630> here<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.680> much<00:03:41.010> longer<00:03:41.690> than<00:03:43.910> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
over here it's much longer than the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.100 
over here it's much longer than the
standard<00:03:45.420> xbox<00:03:45.780> 360<00:03:46.700> headset<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.900> much

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
standard xbox 360 headset it is much

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:58.580 
standard xbox 360 headset it is much
longer<00:03:53.150> see<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.610> wire<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.410> think<00:03:58.410> it's

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
longer see and the wire I think it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.370 
longer see and the wire I think it's
thicker<00:03:59.040> I'm<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.210> sure<00:04:00.480> pretty<00:04:00.990> sure<00:04:01.350> it's

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
thicker I'm not sure pretty sure it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.450 
thicker I'm not sure pretty sure it's
thicker<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.610> standard<00:04:03.530> I'm<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:04.800> sure

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
thicker in the standard I'm not sure

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.820 
thicker in the standard I'm not sure
about<00:04:05.490> that<00:04:05.820> I'm<00:04:06.000> off<00:04:08.270> yeah<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.650> aim<00:04:10.800> of

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
about that I'm off yeah and the aim of

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.030 
about that I'm off yeah and the aim of
this<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:11.490> less<00:04:11.790> bulky<00:04:12.450> around<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.770> part

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
this is it's less bulky around the part

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.320 
this is it's less bulky around the part
that<00:04:14.190> goes<00:04:14.310> next<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.670> eat<00:04:14.850> here<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.120> lot

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
that goes next to eat here so it's a lot

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.150 
that goes next to eat here so it's a lot
less<00:04:18.540> noticeable<00:04:18.960> for<00:04:19.290> when<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.470> kind<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:20.010> has<00:04:20.130> a

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
less noticeable for when I kind of has a

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.670 
less noticeable for when I kind of has a
little<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.610> of<00:04:20.670> hair<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.810> excessive<00:04:22.290> hair

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
little bit of hair like excessive hair

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.620 
little bit of hair like excessive hair
like<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.160> do<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:25.730> then<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:27.060> foam<00:04:27.300> has<00:04:27.600> a

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
like I do so and then the foam has a

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.590 
like I do so and then the foam has a
nice<00:04:27.930> black<00:04:28.320> color<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.130> both<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.390> boom

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
nice black color to it both on the boom

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.840 
nice black color to it both on the boom
and<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.440> hearing<00:04:31.770> part<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.370> this<00:04:34.340> has<00:04:35.340> little

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and the hearing part and this has little

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.390 
and the hearing part and this has little
I<00:04:36.210> think<00:04:36.630> it's<00:04:36.720> Robert<00:04:37.170> feels<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.280> rubber

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
I think it's Robert feels like rubber

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.940 
I think it's Robert feels like rubber
yeah<00:04:41.690> overall<00:04:42.690> it's<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> very<00:04:42.930> good<00:04:43.320> headset<00:04:43.890> i
