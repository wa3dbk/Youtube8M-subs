snatch<00:00:08.940> okay<00:00:09.510> typically<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:10.710> when<00:00:11.040> we

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
snatch okay typically we know when we

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
snatch okay typically we know when we
understand<00:00:11.639> them<00:00:11.880> through<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> snatch<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
understand them through the snatch the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.749 
understand them through the snatch the
barbell<00:00:13.110> travels<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> fairly<00:00:14.070> vertical

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
barbell travels in a fairly vertical

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.269 
barbell travels in a fairly vertical
line<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.480> has<00:00:15.540> an<00:00:15.929> axial<00:00:16.320> s-shaped<00:00:16.740> curve<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
line it has an axial s-shaped curve to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.820 
line it has an axial s-shaped curve to
it<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.199> thinking<00:00:19.560> about<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it but we want it to be thinking about a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.019 
it but we want it to be thinking about a
straight<00:00:20.250> line<00:00:20.520> okay

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
straight line okay

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.240 
straight line okay
now<00:00:21.359> multiple<00:00:21.840> people<00:00:22.500> when<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> practice<00:00:22.920> in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
now multiple people when the practice in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
now multiple people when the practice in
the<00:00:23.400> bunk<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.850> will<00:00:24.000> turn<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> bump<00:00:24.570> they

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the bunk will will turn the bump they

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
the bunk will will turn the bump they
find<00:00:25.529> when<00:00:25.769> they<00:00:25.830> hit<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> barbell<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
find when they hit the barbell the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.939 
find when they hit the barbell the
barbell<00:00:27.480> floats<00:00:27.750> straight<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> elbows

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
barbell floats straight out of elbows

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
barbell floats straight out of elbows
never<00:00:29.160> bends<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> simply<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.119> marks<00:00:30.539> all

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
never bends that simply just marks all

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.840 
never bends that simply just marks all
the<00:00:30.869> way<00:00:30.990> around<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.859> again<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.579> never

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the way around now again that's never

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.030 
the way around now again that's never
going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.570> manageable<00:00:33.989> pattern<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> keep

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
going to be a manageable pattern to keep

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680 
going to be a manageable pattern to keep
once<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> heavier<00:00:36.239> loads

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
once you get to heavier loads

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.479 
once you get to heavier loads
so<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> quick<00:00:37.380> drill<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> break

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so a quick drill just to kind of break

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
so a quick drill just to kind of break
that<00:00:38.790> chain<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> break<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.870> movement

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that chain or to break that movement

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.990 
that chain or to break that movement
pattern<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.190> call<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> bump<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pattern is what we call the bump and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.190 
pattern is what we call the bump and
high<00:00:42.210> pull<00:00:42.629> okay

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
high pull okay

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
high pull okay
now<00:00:43.940> globally<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.149> half<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.690> for

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
now globally first half of you is go for

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
now globally first half of you is go for
a<00:00:45.930> couple<00:00:46.110> position<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> show

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
a couple position so I'm going to show

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
a couple position so I'm going to show
it<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> snap<00:00:47.760> strip<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.390> doesn't<00:00:48.750> clean

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it with a snap strip if we doesn't clean

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
it with a snap strip if we doesn't clean
as<00:00:49.079> well<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.070> bit

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
as well but I think it's a little bit

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
as well but I think it's a little bit
more<00:00:50.430> preferable<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.449> snatch

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
more preferable in a snatch

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.779 
more preferable in a snatch
so<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.559> you're<00:00:52.710> pulling<00:00:53.039> steps<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so you're in you're pulling steps and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.650 
so you're in you're pulling steps and
you're<00:00:53.910> still<00:00:54.090> looking<00:00:54.149> employ<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you're still looking employ your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.139 
you're still looking employ your
children's<00:00:55.050> back<00:00:55.260> chest<00:00:55.890> high<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.760> drop

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
children's back chest high and just drop

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.270 
children's back chest high and just drop
to<00:00:57.180> high<00:00:57.690> hanging<00:00:58.199> position<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:58.890> again<00:00:59.129> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to high hanging position which again is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.910 
to high hanging position which again is
just<00:00:59.489> nice<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.000> straight<00:01:00.960> vertical<00:01:01.230> position

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just nice for straight vertical position

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
just nice for straight vertical position
from<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> position<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.120> create<00:01:03.359> our

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
from this position we create our

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.850 
from this position we create our
separation<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.229> talked<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.650> which

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
separation which we talked about which

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
separation which we talked about which
is<00:01:04.890> simply<00:01:05.309> pulling<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.299> hips<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.439> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
is simply pulling the hips back and what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.510 
is simply pulling the hips back and what
we're<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> we're<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.400> work

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
out a little bump action and then you're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490 
out a little bump action and then you're
gonna<00:01:11.130> pull<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.549> bump<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> high<00:01:13.080> pull

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
little more so is an acceleration of the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
position and pull it into contact rather
than<00:01:33.240> simply<00:01:33.570> letting<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.500> flow<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
than simply letting it flow about in
