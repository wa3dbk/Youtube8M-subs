the<00:00:02.490> hand<00:00:02.700> signal<00:00:02.790> program<00:00:03.420> and<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the hand signal program and the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.440 
the hand signal program and the
competitive<00:00:04.800> part<00:00:04.980> they<00:00:05.759> really<00:00:06.060> go<00:00:06.180> hand<00:00:06.390> in

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
competitive part they really go hand in

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.900 
competitive part they really go hand in
hand<00:00:06.509> now<00:00:07.310> I'll<00:00:08.310> just<00:00:08.370> kind<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> go<00:00:08.880> through

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
hand now I'll just kind of go through

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
hand now I'll just kind of go through
what<00:00:09.180> we<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.139> do<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.500> them

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
what we what we do with them

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
what we what we do with them
once<00:00:12.030> they<00:00:12.179> come<00:00:12.389> back<00:00:12.509> into<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.900> hand<00:00:13.080> signal

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
once they come back into the hand signal

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.919 
once they come back into the hand signal
program<00:00:13.860> gundog<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.480> explained

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
program gundog what I just explained

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
program gundog what I just explained
enhancing<00:00:16.530> those<00:00:16.650> two<00:00:17.130> total<00:00:17.490> different

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
enhancing those two total different

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
enhancing those two total different
worlds<00:00:18.680> gundog<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.890> we're<00:00:20.070> doing<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:21.260> we're

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
worlds gundog what we're doing is we're

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.840 
worlds gundog what we're doing is we're
exposing<00:00:22.740> their<00:00:23.160> strengths<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.760> their

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
exposing their strengths and their

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.509 
exposing their strengths and their
weaknesses<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:25.500> training<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.369> make

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
weaknesses and we're training to make

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
weaknesses and we're training to make
their<00:00:26.730> weaknesses<00:00:27.180> better<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.679> are

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
their weaknesses better and then we are

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.170 
their weaknesses better and then we are
we're<00:00:29.880> actually<00:00:30.230> using<00:00:31.230> their<00:00:31.560> strengths<00:00:32.180> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we're actually using their strengths you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.640 
we're actually using their strengths you
know<00:00:33.330> to<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.840> through<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.470> weak

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
know to get through some of the weak

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.590 
know to get through some of the weak
parts<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.610> hopefully<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
parts you know and hopefully that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700 
parts you know and hopefully that
strength<00:00:36.900> is<00:00:37.050> gonna<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> stronger

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
strength is gonna be a stronger

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.100 
strength is gonna be a stronger
treatment<00:00:38.190> desire<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:39.240> use<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.960> could

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
treatment desire we use that they could

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.480 
treatment desire we use that they could
see<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> birds<00:00:40.620> fall<00:00:40.830> out<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.130> sky<00:00:41.310> and

me go get that bird I saw fall well hand

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
me go get that bird I saw fall well hand
signals<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.930> totally<00:00:46.260> different<00:00:46.380> what<00:00:46.770> we're

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
signals is totally different what we're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.820 
signals is totally different what we're
doing<00:00:47.220> there<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:49.020> presetting<00:00:49.560> they're

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
doing there is we're presetting they're

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.830 
doing there is we're presetting they're
not<00:00:49.980> getting<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.400> a<00:00:50.430> whole<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
not getting to see a whole lot of

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.030 
not getting to see a whole lot of
they're<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.990> getting<00:00:52.200> see<00:00:52.320> birds<00:00:52.560> fall<00:00:52.830> out

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
they're not getting see birds fall out

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.740 
they're not getting see birds fall out
of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> sky<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:54.180> teaching<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of the sky we're teaching them how to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.160 
of the sky we're teaching them how to
run<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.800> run<00:00:56.100> lines<00:00:56.630> to<00:00:57.630> pilots<00:00:58.110> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
run and just run lines to pilots that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.990 
run and just run lines to pilots that
are<00:00:58.290> already<00:00:58.440> preset<00:00:58.860> just<00:00:59.430> called<00:00:59.610> forced<00:00:59.940> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
are already preset just called forced to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
are already preset just called forced to
the<00:01:00.090> pile<00:01:00.330> that's<00:01:00.540> the<00:01:00.720> first<00:01:00.960> stage<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:02.220> go

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the pile that's the first stage we go

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
the pile that's the first stage we go
from<00:01:02.550> walking<00:01:02.940> fetch<00:01:03.409> into<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> force<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
from walking fetch into the force to the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.719 
from walking fetch into the force to the
pile<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:05.549> we're<00:01:05.670> actually

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pile and that's where we're actually

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
pile and that's where we're actually
teaching<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.300> dog<00:01:06.510> how'd<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.800> he

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
teaching that dog how'd it go when he

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
teaching that dog how'd it go when he
feels<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> collar<00:01:08.460> once<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.660> down

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
feels the collar once we get that down

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.900 
feels the collar once we get that down
we<00:01:10.200> start<00:01:10.470> remote<00:01:10.740> casting<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.400> teach<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.730> dog

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910
