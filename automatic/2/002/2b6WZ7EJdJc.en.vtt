00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.139
 hello girls here I am with the first one 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.960
 video of 2013 that actually would be 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.580
 had to be 2012 because I wanted to 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.740
 propose this trick as a second one 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.810
 proposal for new year 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.700
 only that I did not make time and therefore 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.310
 that if only you wanted equally you have me 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.280
 everything and there despite being a 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.960
 very unique makeup not suitable for 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.700
 all occasions 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.190

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.840

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.230

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.820

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
 I give him a room, he knows it's a little bit 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.610
 nicer a little less fussy I hope that 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.220
 the trick you like is that the tutorial 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.410
 may be useful to you and nothing will leave you 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.890
 to the video I first go to hang out 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.890
 the primer 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.420
 after that I'm going to get this 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.899
 pencil that is of the line in india mon 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.949
 pearl white reve and I'm going to roll it out 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 on the whole eyelid 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.690
 from this buffon eye shadow tool I go to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 take this white what it does well 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.530
 applied the pencil 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.590
 now maybe I'm flown in to take it 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.490
 a little of this black and I'm going to trace 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 a line in the crease of the eye 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.960
 and I'm going to join it with another line 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 that goes towards the end of the massacres e 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 never 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 with a brush appeal to pelago a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.040
 more snow on the sea 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 Now 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.569
 from which it runs in the stock exchange to 20 landslides 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.560
 in hand to take this brownish e 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.560
 not just those black ones there 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.230
 above from the same ball that I go to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.530
 take this white or no fig underneath 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530
 eyebrows 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:57.810
 now I take the same pencil as before 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.810
 and twirl a line below 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.980
 I apply over a little white 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.700
 of course 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.030
 around this area to apply this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.480
 black pencil that always from my line 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.480
 Devil 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.540
 melania replied placed here in gel di 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.770
 essence this sigma panel is the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.770
 number 210 you don't remember me 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 with this pastel snow pencil 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:55.349
 cosmetics that more but I go to overlook one 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.349
 line under my line from the edges 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.620
 under this white line I go to 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.099
 draw a second tail 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.099

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.400
 material holders also with eye shadow 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.400
 black 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.970
 made a little bit of white here too 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.830
 to make an eye shadow even more 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.129
 bright to be applied in the eyelid 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.340
 mobile these many white glitter 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.050
 reflected very very nice by the way 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.629
 you always ask me where you can find the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.569
 glitter here and this is not a set 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:50.719

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.150
 he finds them in the nail art makeup department 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:55.729
 I paid them type nor are there 50 of them 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.009
 I apply a lot of them with a little bit of 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.460
 False Eyelash Glue Pat on 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.460
 eye shadow 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:15.990
 I immediately and rightly dabbed in the way 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.990
 to make them stick well 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.150
