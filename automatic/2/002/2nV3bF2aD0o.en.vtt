00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hey guys what is up Carter here today's

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey guys what is up Carter here today's
video<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.480> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.689> be<00:00:03.810> all<00:00:03.929> about<00:00:04.080> bearing

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
video is going to be all about bearing

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.980 
video is going to be all about bearing
systems<00:00:05.250> as<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.640> can<00:00:05.819> see<00:00:06.060> I've<00:00:06.299> only<00:00:06.509> got<00:00:06.750> two

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
systems as you can see I've only got two

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.230 
systems as you can see I've only got two
knives<00:00:07.440> with<00:00:07.740> bearing<00:00:07.980> systems<00:00:08.400> currently<00:00:09.150> in

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
knives with bearing systems currently in

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.299 
knives with bearing systems currently in
my<00:00:09.360> collection<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.530> micro<00:00:10.920> textile

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
my collection this is the micro textile

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.999 
my collection this is the micro textile
comb<00:00:11.460> Delta<00:00:11.880> has<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.750> captured<00:00:13.290> bearing<00:00:13.590> system

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
comb Delta has a captured bearing system

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.359 
comb Delta has a captured bearing system
in<00:00:14.250> little<00:00:14.910> plastic<00:00:15.410> insert<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:16.859> kind<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
in little plastic insert in here kind of

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.950 
in little plastic insert in here kind of
like<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.730> Kershaw<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> zero-tolerance

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
like what Kershaw and zero-tolerance

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.179 
like what Kershaw and zero-tolerance
uses<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.490> has<00:00:20.670> actual<00:00:21.119> ikbs<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.189> should

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
uses this one has actual ikbs I should

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
uses this one has actual ikbs I should
have<00:00:23.519> put<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> video<00:00:24.060> taking<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.660> apart<00:00:25.019> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
have put up a video taking this apart so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.420 
have put up a video taking this apart so
you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.350> check<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.220> what

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you can check that out to see what

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.410 
you can check that out to see what
exactly<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> there

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
exactly is in there

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.390 
exactly is in there
but<00:00:27.750> basically<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.560> loose<00:00:28.890> bearings

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
but basically it just has loose bearings

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.990 
but basically it just has loose bearings
little<00:00:29.640> tiny<00:00:29.849> ball<00:00:30.060> bearings<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:32.000> kind

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
little tiny ball bearings in there kind

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209 
little tiny ball bearings in there kind
of<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.390> there<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.620> held<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:34.950> grease

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
of in there really just held with grease

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.670 
of in there really just held with grease
you<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.700> keeping<00:00:36.000> them<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.570> yeah<00:00:37.170> but

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you know keeping them and so yeah but

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
you know keeping them and so yeah but
aside<00:00:38.340> from<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.480> multiple

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
aside from these two I have on multiple

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
aside from these two I have on multiple
knives<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.530> bearing<00:00:40.770> systems<00:00:41.250> I've<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
knives with bearing systems I've had a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
knives with bearing systems I've had a
McHale<00:00:43.170> Williamson<00:00:43.649> Alamo<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.840> ikbs<00:00:46.010> I've

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
McHale Williamson Alamo with ikbs I've

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.490 
McHale Williamson Alamo with ikbs I've
had<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.700> 0<00:00:47.940> tau<00:00:48.120> 0<00:00:48.690> 5<00:00:48.960> 5<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.710> 0<00:00:49.920> 560<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:51.870> their

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
had the 0 tau 0 5 5 or 0 560 with their

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
had the 0 tau 0 5 5 or 0 560 with their
bearing<00:00:53.309> system<00:00:53.699> they're<00:00:53.820> captured<00:00:54.210> bearing

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bearing system they're captured bearing

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.369 
bearing system they're captured bearing
system<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.020> had<00:00:56.120> my<00:00:57.120> Dyer<00:00:57.390> where<00:00:57.629> custom<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
system I had my Dyer where custom that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
system I had my Dyer where custom that
has<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> bearing<00:00:58.920> system<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> maybe<00:01:03.000> maybe<00:01:03.420> one

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
has a bearing system and maybe maybe one

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
has a bearing system and maybe maybe one
or<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> years<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> I've<00:01:05.549> had

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
or two more over the years that I've had

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.370 
or two more over the years that I've had
so<00:01:06.030> I've<00:01:06.270> had<00:01:06.420> multiple<00:01:06.630> knives<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.140> bearing

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so I've had multiple knives with bearing

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
so I've had multiple knives with bearing
systems<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.240> question<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.750> being

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
systems so the the question that's being

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.190 
systems so the the question that's being
raised<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.590> our<00:01:11.189> bearing<00:01:11.490> system<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:13.460> a

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
raised is our bearing system is just a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.740 
raised is our bearing system is just a
gimmick<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.909> does<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.270> do

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
gimmick you know does it actually do

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.200 
gimmick you know does it actually do
anything<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.280> worthwhile<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
anything is it worthwhile to put in a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.200 
anything is it worthwhile to put in a
knife<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.650> basically<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.490> marketing

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
knife and is basically just a marketing

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.160 
knife and is basically just a marketing
ploy<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.630> sell<00:01:24.659> knives

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
ploy to sell knives

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
ploy to sell knives
first<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.189> I'd<00:01:26.340> say<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.700> absolutely<00:01:27.119> not

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
first off I'd say no absolutely not

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
first off I'd say no absolutely not
bearings<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.560> been<00:01:28.710> used<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.189> many<00:01:29.549> many

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bearings have been used for many many

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.300 
bearings have been used for many many
years<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.180> reduce<00:01:30.630> friction<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.500> moving<00:01:31.950> parts

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
years to reduce friction in moving parts

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
years to reduce friction in moving parts
in<00:01:32.490> fact<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.930> introduction<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in fact you know the introduction of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
in fact you know the introduction of
bearing<00:01:34.920> systems<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.030> revolution

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
bearing systems is kind of a revolution

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
bearing systems is kind of a revolution
in<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> machining<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> things<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
in the machining and things like that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.480 
in the machining and things like that
even<00:01:39.030> something<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.509> skateboards<00:01:40.490> captured

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
even something like skateboards captured

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.210 
even something like skateboards captured
ball<00:01:42.119> bearing<00:01:42.420> system<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.320> tires

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
ball bearing system in the tires

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.219 
ball bearing system in the tires
basically<00:01:44.970> helped<00:01:45.240> move<00:01:45.450> skateboards<00:01:46.079> from

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
basically helped move skateboards from

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
basically helped move skateboards from
being<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> novelty<00:01:47.189> toy<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.960> an

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
being just a novelty toy to you know an

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.580 
being just a novelty toy to you know an
actual<00:01:49.649> legitimate<00:01:50.450> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> sport<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
actual legitimate kind of sport so you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
actual legitimate kind of sport so you
really<00:01:52.799> wouldn't<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.040> X<00:01:53.369> games<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.909> things

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
really wouldn't have X games and things

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
really wouldn't have X games and things
like<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.990> ball<00:01:55.290> bearings<00:01:55.619> hadn't<00:01:55.920> been

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
like that if ball bearings hadn't been

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.289 
like that if ball bearings hadn't been
introduced<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.229> say<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.310> bearing

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
introduced so to to say that a bearing

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.080 
introduced so to to say that a bearing
system<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.189> intrinsically<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.850> gimmick

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
system is intrinsically just a gimmick

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
system it's going into I think is a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.460 
system it's going into I think is a
funny<00:02:10.560> ignorant<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.580> being<00:02:11.849> said<00:02:12.290> does<00:02:13.290> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
funny ignorant that being said does that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
funny ignorant that being said does that
mean<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.160> necessarily<00:02:14.340> worth<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
mean that it's necessarily worth the

mean that it's necessarily worth the

money to have it in there now that's a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.540 
money to have it in there now that's a

smoother absolutely I you know and
there's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> few<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.230> didn't<00:02:28.560> do<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
there's a few that that didn't do it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that right or didn't do it well and it's

that right or didn't do it well and it's
not<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.500> smooth<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.129> would<00:02:32.280> say<00:02:32.569> no

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
not that smooth and I would say no

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.420 
not that smooth and I would say no
regular<00:02:39.080> washers<00:02:40.080> would<00:02:40.470> would<00:02:40.830> work<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.040> as

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
regular washers would would work just as

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.360 
regular washers would would work just as
well<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:42.360> for<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> most<00:02:43.440> part<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.160> knives

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
well but for the most part the knives

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
well but for the most part the knives
I've<00:02:44.610> had<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.599> implemented<00:02:46.080> bearings

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
I've had that have implemented bearings

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.490 
I've had that have implemented bearings
well<00:02:47.190> such<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.090> my<00:02:48.209> McHale<00:02:48.540> Wellington<00:02:49.050> Alamo

well such as my McHale Wellington Alamo
that<00:02:50.430> thing<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.180> mean<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.230> opened<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.739> up

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
that thing I mean you opened that up

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.130 
that thing I mean you opened that up
fortunately<00:02:53.910> I've<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.540> sold<00:02:54.900> that

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
fortunately I've actually sold that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.070 
fortunately I've actually sold that
knife<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> open<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.819> thing

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
knife but when you to open that thing

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.350 
knife but when you to open that thing
you<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.590> don't<00:02:59.250> know<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.430> hard<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> describe<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
you I don't know it's hard to describe I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.080 
you I don't know it's hard to describe I
mean<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.599> just<00:03:00.720> glide<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:02.129> glide<00:03:02.550> open<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
mean it just glide just glide open and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.110 
mean it just glide just glide open and
yet<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.269> was<00:03:03.360> completely<00:03:03.989> solid<00:03:04.650> no<00:03:05.489> movement

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
yet it was completely solid no movement

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.890 
yet it was completely solid no movement
whatsoever

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
whatsoever

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
whatsoever
you'd<00:03:07.230> open<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.459> would<00:03:08.610> assume

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you'd open that up and you would assume

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
you'd open that up and you would assume
that<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.750> pivot<00:03:10.080> was<00:03:10.200> extremely<00:03:10.650> loose

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that the the pivot was extremely loose

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.559 
that the the pivot was extremely loose
and<00:03:11.280> then<00:03:11.400> you'd<00:03:11.519> go<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> move<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> blade<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
and then you'd go to move the blade and

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.699 
and then you'd go to move the blade and
it<00:03:12.690> was<00:03:12.780> rock-solid<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.569> was<00:03:15.720> extremely

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
it was rock-solid that one was extremely

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.660 
it was rock-solid that one was extremely
smooth<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.129> Sampha<00:03:18.470> nuts<00:03:19.470> not<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.010> tongue<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
smooth the Sampha nuts not a tongue I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.940 
smooth the Sampha nuts not a tongue I
don't<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.140> can't<00:03:22.650> really<00:03:22.739> say

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
don't know I just and I can't really say

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.210 
don't know I just and I can't really say
for<00:03:22.980> sure<00:03:23.129> why<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.030> seems<00:03:24.360> like<00:03:25.220> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
for sure why but it just seems like this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.500 
for sure why but it just seems like this
would<00:03:26.430> be<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:27.000> as<00:03:27.150> good<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:29.510> regular

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
would be just as good with regular

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.050 
would be just as good with regular
washers<00:03:30.959> my<00:03:31.650> only<00:03:31.860> guess<00:03:32.069> would<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.489> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
washers my only guess would be that you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.410 
washers my only guess would be that you
know<00:03:33.150> being<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:35.090> little<00:03:36.090> bit<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.360> a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
know being that it's a little bit of a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
know being that it's a little bit of a
lower<00:03:36.569> cost<00:03:36.840> knife<00:03:37.200> although<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.099> it's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
lower cost knife although it's it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.890 
lower cost knife although it's it's
fairly<00:03:38.610> expensive<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.239> what<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.599> but

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
fairly expensive for what it is but

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.309 
fairly expensive for what it is but
still<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.500> know<00:03:40.640> produced<00:03:41.640> overseas<00:03:42.319> that

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
still you know produced overseas that

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.320 
still you know produced overseas that
maybe<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> tolerances<00:03:44.099> weren't<00:03:44.430> quite<00:03:44.700> good

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
maybe the tolerances weren't quite good

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.710 
maybe the tolerances weren't quite good
enough<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.900> bring<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:47.459> maximum<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
enough to bring the maximum out of the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.710 
enough to bring the maximum out of the
bearing<00:03:48.959> system<00:03:49.379> would<00:03:49.920> be<00:03:50.069> my<00:03:50.190> only<00:03:50.430> guess

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
bearing system would be my only guess

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.470 
bearing system would be my only guess
but<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.260> other<00:03:52.379> hand

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
but this one on the other hand

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.770 
but this one on the other hand
extremely<00:03:54.480> smooth<00:03:56.210> extremely<00:03:57.210> smooth<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
extremely smooth extremely smooth and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.730 
extremely smooth extremely smooth and
once<00:03:57.960> again<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.440> know

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
once again you know

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.710 
once again you know
no<00:04:00.920> no<00:04:01.920> bleh<00:04:02.160> bleh<00:04:02.430> or<00:04:02.550> anything<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.480> just

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
no no bleh bleh or anything and it just

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.700 
no no bleh bleh or anything and it just
I<00:04:04.310> would<00:04:05.310> let<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:06.330> fall<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.200> gonna<00:04:07.410> cut

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
I would let it fall but it's gonna cut

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.840 
I would let it fall but it's gonna cut
me<00:04:07.890> but<00:04:10.100> yeah<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.640> definitely

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
me but yeah so I think it definitely

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.760 
me but yeah so I think it definitely
increases<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.750> smoothness<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.500> knife

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
increases the smoothness of the knife

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.020 
increases the smoothness of the knife
and<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:14.790> far<00:04:15.030> as<00:04:16.640> negative<00:04:17.640> things<00:04:17.880> about

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
and as far as negative things about

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.560 
and as far as negative things about
having<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.540> bearing<00:04:18.810> system<00:04:19.700> like<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:21.060> ikbs

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
having a bearing system like with ikbs

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.230 
having a bearing system like with ikbs
you<00:04:21.900> could<00:04:22.110> say<00:04:22.790> taking<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.880> part<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
you could say taking it part in the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.910 
you could say taking it part in the
field<00:04:24.510> could<00:04:24.870> be<00:04:24.990> problematic

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
field could be problematic

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.710 
field could be problematic
you<00:04:26.550> could<00:04:26.700> easily<00:04:26.850> looser<00:04:27.330> some<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.660> those

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
you could easily looser some of those

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.450 
you could easily looser some of those
little<00:04:28.110> little<00:04:28.440> bearings<00:04:28.950> or<00:04:29.130> have<00:04:29.280> some

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
little little bearings or have some

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.340 
little little bearings or have some
trouble<00:04:29.730> getting<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.030> back<00:04:30.150> together<00:04:30.350> but

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
trouble getting it back together but

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.230 
trouble getting it back together but
with<00:04:31.500> these<00:04:31.680> thrust<00:04:32.340> bearing<00:04:32.640> systems<00:04:33.060> you

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
with these thrust bearing systems you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.390 
with these thrust bearing systems you
know<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.450> captured<00:04:33.870> bearing<00:04:34.170> systems<00:04:34.590> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
know the captured bearing systems you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.910 
know the captured bearing systems you
don't<00:04:35.520> really<00:04:35.640> have<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.150> problem

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
don't really have that problem

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.070 
don't really have that problem
it<00:04:37.920> goes<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.370> basically<00:04:38.880> like<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.300> washer<00:04:39.840> it's

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
it goes in basically like a washer it's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.200 
it goes in basically like a washer it's
no<00:04:40.260> different<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.520> don't<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:41.970> there's

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
no different so I don't think there's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.700 
no different so I don't think there's
really<00:04:42.360> any<00:04:42.600> hindrance<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.230> having<00:04:43.560> one

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
really any hindrance to having one

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.590 
really any hindrance to having one
that's<00:04:44.340> really<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.790> only<00:04:44.820> legitimate

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
that's really the only legitimate

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.410 
that's really the only legitimate
argument<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.820> worth<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.000> extra<00:04:48.240> money

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
argument is is it worth the extra money

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.960 
argument is is it worth the extra money
I<00:04:48.660> mean<00:04:48.900> usually<00:04:49.460> knives<00:04:50.460> with<00:04:50.670> bearing

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
I mean usually knives with bearing

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.490 
I mean usually knives with bearing
systems<00:04:51.420> you<00:04:51.690> know<00:04:51.780> obviously<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:52.410> more

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
systems you know obviously it's more

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.140 
systems you know obviously it's more
expensive<00:04:52.980> it's<00:04:53.160> more<00:04:53.310> expensive<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.730> machine

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
expensive it's more expensive to machine

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.740 
expensive it's more expensive to machine
all<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.840> pieces<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.360> ball<00:04:57.360> bearings

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
all the pieces so that the ball bearings

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.050 
all the pieces so that the ball bearings
actually<00:04:58.110> go<00:04:58.290> inside<00:04:58.650> some<00:04:58.920> sort<00:04:58.950> of<00:04:59.250> track

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
actually go inside some sort of track

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.580 
actually go inside some sort of track
you<00:05:00.450> know<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:00.720> not<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:01.020> easy<00:05:01.140> as<00:05:01.410> just

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
you know it's not as easy as just

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.860 
you know it's not as easy as just
throwing<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.920> washer<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.400> there<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.180> washers

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
throwing a washer in there so washers

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.200 
throwing a washer in there so washers
are<00:05:03.990> definitely<00:05:04.410> cheaper<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.880> that's<00:05:06.060> you

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
are definitely cheaper and that's you

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.550 
are definitely cheaper and that's you
know<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.480> said<00:05:06.630> that's<00:05:06.810> only<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.080> question

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
know like I said that's only a question

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
know like I said that's only a question
you<00:05:07.800> can<00:05:08.040> answer<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.669> myself<00:05:09.360> do<00:05:10.020> not<00:05:10.580> really

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
you can answer I myself do not really

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.730 
you can answer I myself do not really
have<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> sway<00:05:12.240> either<00:05:12.600> way<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:13.140> would<00:05:13.260> be<00:05:13.410> fine

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
have a sway either way I would be fine

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.590 
have a sway either way I would be fine
if<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.070> knife<00:05:14.280> didn't<00:05:14.669> have<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:14.880> bang<00:05:15.180> system

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
if this knife didn't have a bang system

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.860 
if this knife didn't have a bang system
in<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:16.550> but<00:05:17.550> at<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.850> same<00:05:17.940> time<00:05:18.180> I<00:05:18.210> appreciate

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
in it but at the same time I appreciate

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.930 
in it but at the same time I appreciate
having<00:05:19.260> it<00:05:19.350> in<00:05:19.470> there<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.070> know<00:05:20.640> I'm<00:05:20.790> not

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
having it in there so I know I'm not

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.090 
having it in there so I know I'm not
gonna<00:05:21.120> say<00:05:21.390> I<00:05:21.419> wish<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.840> did<00:05:22.020> her<00:05:22.200> I'm<00:05:22.620> glad<00:05:22.919> it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
gonna say I wish it did her I'm glad it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.190 
gonna say I wish it did her I'm glad it
I'm<00:05:23.970> sorry<00:05:24.150> it's<00:05:24.510> not<00:05:24.540> I'm<00:05:24.780> not<00:05:24.810> gonna<00:05:25.020> say<00:05:25.169> I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
I'm sorry it's not I'm not gonna say I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.650 
I'm sorry it's not I'm not gonna say I
wish<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.500> didn't<00:05:25.800> or<00:05:26.490> I'm<00:05:26.580> an<00:05:26.700> extremely<00:05:27.060> glad

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
wish it didn't or I'm an extremely glad

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.290 
wish it didn't or I'm an extremely glad
it<00:05:27.840> did<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.200> me<00:05:28.320> it's<00:05:28.500> really<00:05:28.830> not<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.150> not<00:05:30.150> an

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
it did to me it's really not a not an

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.380 
it did to me it's really not a not an
issue<00:05:30.480> I<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:31.440> smooth<00:05:31.740> knives<00:05:31.980> but<00:05:32.520> it's

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
issue I like smooth knives but it's

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.659 
issue I like smooth knives but it's
really<00:05:33.630> not<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.200> huge<00:05:34.560> deal<00:05:34.890> as<00:05:35.190> long<00:05:35.220> as<00:05:35.550> it

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
really not a huge deal as long as it

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.260 
really not a huge deal as long as it
opens<00:05:36.090> without<00:05:36.840> hindrance<00:05:37.520> I'm<00:05:38.520> fine<00:05:38.970> with<00:05:39.150> it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
opens without hindrance I'm fine with it

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.500 
opens without hindrance I'm fine with it
and<00:05:39.450> that's<00:05:39.570> just<00:05:39.630> me<00:05:39.960> but<00:05:40.490> but<00:05:41.490> yeah<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:42.120> think

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
and that's just me but but yeah I think

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.000 
and that's just me but but yeah I think
the<00:05:42.630> argument<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.169> it<00:05:43.320> doesn't<00:05:43.620> do<00:05:43.770> anything

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
the argument that it doesn't do anything

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.260 
the argument that it doesn't do anything
for<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.370> knife<00:05:44.520> or<00:05:44.730> does<00:05:44.850> an<00:05:44.970> increase

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
for the knife or does an increase

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.020 
for the knife or does an increase
smoothness<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.710> can<00:05:46.860> put<00:05:47.370> your<00:05:47.490> hand<00:05:47.700> on<00:05:47.880> any

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
smoothness you can put your hand on any

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.500 
smoothness you can put your hand on any
number<00:05:48.270> of<00:05:48.470> bearing<00:05:49.470> knives<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.730> don't<00:05:51.300> see

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
number of bearing knives and I don't see

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.310 
number of bearing knives and I don't see
how<00:05:51.660> you<00:05:51.720> can<00:05:51.930> recruit<00:05:52.260> refute<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:52.919> it

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
how you can recruit refute that it

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.480 
how you can recruit refute that it
doesn't

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
doesn't

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.879 
doesn't
I<00:05:56.580> add<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.750> smoothness<00:05:58.199> of<00:05:58.289> the<00:05:58.410> knife<00:05:58.590> um

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
I add to the smoothness of the knife um

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.080 
I add to the smoothness of the knife um
and<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.130> just<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.430> don't<00:05:59.580> really<00:05:59.729> see<00:05:59.910> how<00:06:00.030> you

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
and I just I don't really see how you

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.770 
and I just I don't really see how you
could<00:06:00.530> not<00:06:01.530> see<00:06:01.770> that<00:06:01.979> but<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.789> can<00:06:03.360> also<00:06:03.509> see

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
could not see that but you can also see

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.779 
could not see that but you can also see
why<00:06:03.960> some<00:06:04.199> people<00:06:04.319> don't<00:06:04.710> think<00:06:05.009> it's<00:06:06.410> an

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
why some people don't think it's an

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.010 
why some people don't think it's an
improvement<00:06:08.789> enough<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:09.449> want<00:06:09.630> to<00:06:09.660> pay<00:06:09.840> the

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
improvement enough to want to pay the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.629 
improvement enough to want to pay the
extra<00:06:10.199> money<00:06:10.319> for<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.889> so<00:06:10.949> that's<00:06:11.190> my<00:06:11.340> thoughts

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
extra money for it so that's my thoughts

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.820 
extra money for it so that's my thoughts
on<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.360> bearing<00:06:12.599> systems<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.740> are

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
on the bearing systems that are

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.800 
on the bearing systems that are
currently<00:06:14.099> out<00:06:14.160> there<00:06:14.310> I<00:06:14.639> prefer<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.419> capture

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
currently out there I prefer the capture

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.689 
currently out there I prefer the capture
bearing<00:06:16.080> systems<00:06:16.500> for<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.009> mention<00:06:17.340> for<00:06:17.610> the

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
bearing systems for the mention for the

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.909 
bearing systems for the mention for the
reasons<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.090> mentioned<00:06:18.240> before<00:06:18.800> easier<00:06:19.800> to

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
reasons I mentioned before easier to

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.820 
reasons I mentioned before easier to
take<00:06:20.099> down<00:06:20.310> easier<00:06:20.759> to<00:06:20.880> manage<00:06:21.680> having<00:06:22.680> those

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
take down easier to manage having those

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.550 
take down easier to manage having those
loose<00:06:23.099> bearings<00:06:23.550> in<00:06:23.669> there<00:06:23.849> is<00:06:24.199> kind<00:06:25.199> of<00:06:25.259> scary

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
loose bearings in there is kind of scary

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.100 
loose bearings in there is kind of scary
it's<00:06:25.740> kind<00:06:25.889> of<00:06:25.919> a<00:06:26.009> pain<00:06:26.509> sometimes<00:06:27.509> when<00:06:28.020> you

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
it's kind of a pain sometimes when you

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.450 
it's kind of a pain sometimes when you
go<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.289> put<00:06:28.470> it<00:06:28.500> back<00:06:28.680> together<00:06:28.830> they'll<00:06:29.220> kind

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
go to put it back together they'll kind

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.370 
go to put it back together they'll kind
of<00:06:29.520> clump<00:06:29.759> together<00:06:29.909> in<00:06:30.389> the<00:06:30.630> wrong<00:06:31.080> way<00:06:31.349> and

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
of clump together in the wrong way and

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.379 
of clump together in the wrong way and
you<00:06:32.039> struggle<00:06:32.759> getting<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:33.090> back<00:06:33.210> together

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
you struggle getting it back together

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.749 
you struggle getting it back together
and<00:06:33.750> things<00:06:33.930> so<00:06:34.199> I<00:06:34.229> definitely<00:06:35.159> have<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.520> say

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
and things so I definitely have to say

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.149 
and things so I definitely have to say
that<00:06:35.840> I'd<00:06:36.840> like<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.139> captured<00:06:37.590> bearing

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
that I'd like to captured bearing

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.370 
that I'd like to captured bearing
systems<00:06:38.580> if<00:06:38.819> I<00:06:38.940> had<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.180> choose<00:06:39.389> but<00:06:40.169> overall

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
systems if I had to choose but overall

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.529 
systems if I had to choose but overall
I'm<00:06:40.680> really<00:06:40.889> kind<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.340> indifferent<00:06:41.849> whether

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
I'm really kind of indifferent whether

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.260 
I'm really kind of indifferent whether
my<00:06:42.720> knives<00:06:42.960> do<00:06:43.229> or<00:06:43.560> don't<00:06:43.919> have<00:06:44.849> a<00:06:44.880> bearing

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
my knives do or don't have a bearing

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.689 
my knives do or don't have a bearing
system<00:06:45.659> but<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:46.319> do<00:06:46.530> definitely<00:06:46.860> notice<00:06:47.400> a

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
system but I do definitely notice a

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.059 
system but I do definitely notice a
difference<00:06:48.300> in<00:06:48.509> the<00:06:49.319> knives<00:06:49.530> and<00:06:49.710> have<00:06:49.889> them

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 
difference in the knives and have them

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.649 
difference in the knives and have them
alright<00:06:50.669> guys<00:06:50.849> take<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.300> easy

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
alright guys take it easy

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.610 
alright guys take it easy
have<00:06:51.990> a<00:06:52.020> good<00:06:52.229> day<00:06:52.620> I'll<00:06:53.190> catch<00:06:53.430> you<00:06:53.580> later
