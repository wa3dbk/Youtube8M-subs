00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
alright so on that level I believe it's

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.949

47<00:00:09.549> yes<00:00:10.549> i'm<00:00:10.850> on<00:00:11.000> level<00:00:11.180> 4<00:00:11.510> you<00:00:11.600> set<00:00:11.809> him<00:00:11.900> right

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:11.959 
47 yes i'm on level 4 you set him right

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.359 
47 yes i'm on level 4 you set him right
now<00:00:12.280> this<00:00:13.280> is<00:00:13.520> on<00:00:13.699> medium<00:00:14.949> this<00:00:15.949> is<00:00:16.100> what<00:00:16.250> I've

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
now this is on medium this is what I've

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.560 
now this is on medium this is what I've
upgraded<00:00:16.610> so<00:00:17.180> far<00:00:17.859> but<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.039> first<00:00:19.279> two<00:00:19.580> at

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
upgraded so far but the first two at

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.790 
upgraded so far but the first two at
level<00:00:21.289> 10<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.939> level<00:00:22.939> 11<00:00:23.330> level<00:00:23.960> 10<00:00:24.169> I<00:00:24.199> have<00:00:24.589> not

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
level 10 a level 11 level 10 I have not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.169 
level 10 a level 11 level 10 I have not
bought<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.220> wizard<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:27.519> want<00:00:28.519> to<00:00:28.579> max<00:00:29.029> out

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
bought the wizard I want to max out

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.210 
bought the wizard I want to max out
my<00:00:29.240> first<00:00:29.660> row<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:29.929> actually<00:00:30.259> want<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:30.679> do<00:00:30.859> it<00:00:31.039> in

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
my first row I actually want to do it in

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.920 
my first row I actually want to do it in
order<00:00:33.820> something<00:00:34.820> just<00:00:35.059> tells<00:00:35.270> me<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.899> is

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
order something just tells me that it is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.290 
order something just tells me that it is
probably<00:00:36.530> i'm<00:00:36.860> going<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.430> benefit<00:00:37.850> from<00:00:37.910> it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
probably i'm going to benefit from it

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.130 
probably i'm going to benefit from it
more<00:00:38.829> when<00:00:39.829> i<00:00:39.949> hopped<00:00:40.520> around<00:00:40.730> on<00:00:41.300> easy<00:00:41.690> i

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
more when i hopped around on easy i

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.209 
more when i hopped around on easy i
noticed<00:00:42.859> that<00:00:42.949> i<00:00:43.129> had<00:00:43.520> long<00:00:44.120> periods<00:00:44.449> of<00:00:44.899> time

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
noticed that i had long periods of time

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.220 
noticed that i had long periods of time
where<00:00:46.219> I<00:00:46.579> would<00:00:46.940> not<00:00:47.149> have<00:00:47.180> money<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.079> would

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
where I would not have money and I would

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.560 
where I would not have money and I would
have<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.500> go<00:00:48.649> back<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.129> I<00:00:50.120> would<00:00:50.239> actually

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
have to go back and I would actually

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.119 
have to go back and I would actually
have<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:50.750> do<00:00:50.989> levels<00:00:51.410> over<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.739> over<00:00:51.859> and<00:00:52.039> over

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
have to do levels over and over and over

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.369 
have to do levels over and over and over
to<00:00:52.399> get<00:00:52.550> coin<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.890> far<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.850> have<00:00:56.179> not<00:00:56.629> had<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.170> do

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
to get coin so far I have not had to do

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.419 
to get coin so far I have not had to do
that<00:00:57.620> too<00:00:57.980> much<00:00:59.530> but<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.559> don't<00:01:01.010> find<00:01:01.309> myself

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
that too much but I don't find myself

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.170 
that too much but I don't find myself
really<00:01:02.000> getting<00:01:02.480> stuck<00:01:03.580> most<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.910> levels

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
really getting stuck most of the levels

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.440 
really getting stuck most of the levels
i<00:01:05.600> can<00:01:05.870> eat<00:01:06.170> within<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.770> first<00:01:07.070> i<00:01:07.340> would<00:01:08.240> say

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
i can eat within the first i would say

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.540 
i can eat within the first i would say
minute<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.050> half<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.860> first<00:01:10.190> three

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
minute and a half to the first three

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.800 
minute and a half to the first three
minutes<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.980> most<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.510> with

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
minutes and most of that is just with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.920 
minutes and most of that is just with
using<00:01:15.320> super<00:01:16.040> gunners<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.570> super

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
using super gunners and the super

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.530 
using super gunners and the super
mortars<00:01:18.410> mainly<00:01:19.370> relying<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.180> super

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
mortars mainly relying on the super

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.300 
mortars mainly relying on the super
gunners<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.320> just<00:01:21.560> backing<00:01:22.040> them<00:01:22.160> up

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
gunners and then just backing them up

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.190 
gunners and then just backing them up
with<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.730> mortars<00:01:23.150> because<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.690> mortar<00:01:23.990> does

have a
longer<00:01:25.530> range<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:28.369> as<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
longer range to it as you see I do you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.929 
longer range to it as you see I do you
have<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> gold<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.759> my

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
have the gold all the way up I have my

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.249 
have the gold all the way up I have my
damage<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> arrows<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> level<00:01:34.770> 7<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
damage on the arrows to level 7 I

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
damage on the arrows to level 7 I
actually<00:01:37.259> turn<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.920> arrows<00:01:38.430> off<00:01:38.729> once<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.330> start

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actually turn my arrows off once I start

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.010 
actually turn my arrows off once I start
mass<00:01:39.899> producing<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> soldiers

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
mass producing a lot of soldiers

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.630 
mass producing a lot of soldiers
typically<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.289> do<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.799> only<00:01:43.979> produce<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
typically what I do is I only produce so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.710 
typically what I do is I only produce so
many<00:01:44.789> off<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.590> start<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> can

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
many off of the at the start so I can

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.109 
many off of the at the start so I can
hold<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.409> bay<00:01:49.610> once<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.140> am<00:01:52.140> content<00:01:52.680> with

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
hold them at bay once I am content with

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.169 
hold them at bay once I am content with
that<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.509> I've<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.990> hold<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
that that I've can hold it back I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.210 
that that I've can hold it back I
stopped<00:01:57.179> the<00:01:57.390> arrows<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.860> start

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
stopped the arrows and then I start

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.510 
stopped the arrows and then I start
mass-producing<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.800> haven't<00:02:01.800> really<00:02:01.979> focused

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
mass-producing I haven't really focused

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
mass-producing I haven't really focused
on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.819> range<00:02:03.090> there's<00:02:03.539> no<00:02:03.720> real<00:02:04.020> reason<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
on the range there's no real reason to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.469 
on the range there's no real reason to
to<00:02:05.580> shoot<00:02:05.819> farther<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:08.479> doesn't

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to shoot farther down right now doesn't

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.180 
to shoot farther down right now doesn't
really<00:02:09.569> matter<00:02:09.899> where<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.259> hold<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.799> most<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
really matter where you hold the most of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
really matter where you hold the most of
the<00:02:11.250> times<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.640> don't<00:02:11.790> even<00:02:12.000> max<00:02:12.239> out<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> range

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the times I don't even max out the range

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.970 
the times I don't even max out the range
anyways<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:14.750> I'm<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.959> focused<00:02:16.230> about<00:02:16.709> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
anyways so I'm not focused about that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.470 
anyways so I'm not focused about that
fire<00:02:17.670> speed<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.600> max<00:02:19.049> up<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.700> do<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:21.030> my<00:02:21.209> mana

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
fire speed I do max up I do have my mana
