00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.280
 Y 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.480
 I am Ricardo to graze the beginnings and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.029
 osteopath I am the creator of the technique 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.259
 of rp os what does education mean 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.270
 osteopathic postural is a technique that 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.020
 It has to do with the postural education 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.020
 of the body 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.680
 it's a dynamic way to solve 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.200
 shortening postural problems 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.360
 muscles or those factors that 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.489
 Induce the body to a state of rigidity 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.559
 the skill in any sport is 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.059
 achieved by the sum of different 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 factors 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.820
 No doubt talent is a condition 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.159
 essential but in parallel 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.350
 motor coordination strength 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.629
 elasticity constitute pillars 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.949
 fundamentals where the good 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.949
 body functioning 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.890
 The rb offers a wide range of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.930
 therapeutic possibilities are many 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.150
 elements that interact in the same 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.610
 scenario this allows the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.210
 treatment has repercussions in many aspects 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.210
 both 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 the people who have an activity 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.050
 labor force, such as for example 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.210
 those who work in offices with 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.730
 many hours sitting in front of a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.150
 monitor the body to bad 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.150
 postures 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.869
 the rp contemplates possibilities for 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 work on each particular problem 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.210
 one 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 age children spend growth 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.050
 by different stages in its development 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.600
 these stages are related to the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.440
 maturation of the systems that make up 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 the human body allow the freedom of 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.170
 his movements is to ensure a normal 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.690
 growth and the balance of their 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.930
 basic functions 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 as we grow we move forward 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 in age we also change our 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.770
 morphological characteristics and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.960
 physiological 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 this makes us work more 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.209
 slow and unstable 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.319
 the rp technique improves these 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:39.019
 aspects we work proprioception the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.019
 balance strength elongation 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.060
 Y 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 the postures in suspension that 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.410
 we use with the swings we 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.620
 allow to work specifically a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.650
 tissue accurately takes advantage 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.790
 well the patient's own weight and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.320
 comfort that the work system has 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.410
 getting in this way is to remove 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.230
 Chronically retracted tissues do not 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.640
 contributed by injuries or by 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.640
 postural alterations 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.970
 in the sports field players of 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.070
 soccer rugby tennis dancers prefer 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.590
 this technique for the benefits that 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.950
 they find when flexing their muscles 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.950
 and joints
