it was pretty interesting to do it I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380 
it was pretty interesting to do it I
mean<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> enjoy<00:00:34.860> driving<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.399> cars<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.270> it

stock configuration if I'm not mistaken
I<00:00:39.989> believe<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> 1367<00:00:41.190> yes<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.059> 1367<00:00:43.250> like

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I believe was 1367 yes it was 1367 like

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.459 
I believe was 1367 yes it was 1367 like
97<00:00:44.940> mile<00:00:45.090> an<00:00:45.239> hour<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.450> believe<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
97 mile an hour I believe so a really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
97 mile an hour I believe so a really
impressive<00:00:46.980> car<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.850> wanted<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> add<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
impressive car but we wanted to add a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.369 
impressive car but we wanted to add a
little<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.539> power<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> nothing

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little more power to it and nothing

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900 
little more power to it and nothing
better<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.920> pro<00:00:50.129> charger<00:00:50.340> tell<00:00:50.730> me<00:00:50.820> about

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
better than a pro charger tell me about

it takes the intake charge that comes

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.960 
it takes the intake charge that comes
out<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> supercharger<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.850> you're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
out of the supercharger because you're

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
out of the supercharger because you're
compressing<00:01:18.270> air<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:18.869> makes<00:01:19.140> heat<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.950> it
