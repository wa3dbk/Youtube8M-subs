00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.030 
so the battery also said a little better
in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.250> galaxy<00:03:20.670> s3<00:03:21.260> but<00:03:22.260> I'm<00:03:22.530> sure<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:22.890> gonna

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
in the galaxy s3 but I'm sure it's gonna

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
in the galaxy s3 but I'm sure it's gonna
be<00:03:23.220> better<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:23.580> perform<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.360> if<00:03:24.480> you're<00:03:24.690> gonna

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
be better in perform so if you're gonna

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.480 
be better in perform so if you're gonna
have<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.260> along<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.800> battery<00:03:26.100> life<00:03:26.250> with

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
have it along your battery life with

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.490 
have it along your battery life with
because<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.630> lot<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.050> do<00:03:28.170> with<00:03:28.350> your

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
because that's a lot to do with your

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.220 
because that's a lot to do with your
software<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.690> plastic<00:03:36.690> stickers

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
software to have some plastic stickers

00:03:37.230 --> 00:04:02.380 
software to have some plastic stickers
here<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.830> side

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.880 

interesting

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.500 

in<00:04:07.890> some<00:04:08.070> videos<00:04:08.490> let<00:04:08.670> me<00:04:08.760> get<00:04:08.910> forget<00:04:09.210> to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
in some videos let me get forget to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.530 
in some videos let me get forget to
remove<00:04:09.900> these<00:04:10.110> plastic<00:04:10.380> things<00:04:11.010> inside<00:04:14.540> here

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
remove these plastic things inside here

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.660 
remove these plastic things inside here

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
we go you see me now how do we get this

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.100 
we go you see me now how do we get this
back<00:04:20.970> off<00:04:21.300> I<00:04:22.880> don't<00:04:23.880> think<00:04:24.210> we're<00:04:24.300> gonna<00:04:24.420> turn

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
back off I don't think we're gonna turn

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:37.360 
back off I don't think we're gonna turn
on<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.530> phone<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.100> video<00:04:26.400> though<00:04:34.790> okay

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
on the phone in this video though okay

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.050 
on the phone in this video though okay
we<00:04:38.370> go<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:40.350> plug<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.890> in<00:04:41.100> we<00:04:43.220> go<00:04:44.220> got<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.820> nice

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
we go and plug that in we go got a nice

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.690 
we go and plug that in we go got a nice
weight<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:49.560> my<00:04:49.800> picture<00:04:50.130> camera<00:04:50.610> of

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
weight to it if my picture camera of

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.420 
weight to it if my picture camera of
course<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.800> don't<00:04:52.800> mind

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
course I don't mind

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.660 
course I don't mind
I<00:04:53.580> think<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.570> LG<00:04:55.050> Prada<00:04:55.530> lucky<00:04:56.130> phone<00:04:58.670> and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
I think of the LG Prada lucky phone and

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.700 
I think of the LG Prada lucky phone and
I<00:04:59.820> think<00:05:00.240> we<00:05:00.360> have<00:05:00.540> some<00:05:00.720> more<00:05:00.900> plastic<00:05:01.260> here

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
I think we have some more plastic here

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.750 
I think we have some more plastic here
on<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.370> sides<00:05:02.700> used<00:05:03.620> some<00:05:04.620> small<00:05:04.770> stickers

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
on the sides used some small stickers

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.620 
on the sides used some small stickers
protecting<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.480> side<00:05:08.630> see<00:05:10.400> okay<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:12.120> think

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
protecting the side see okay so I think

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.150 
protecting the side see okay so I think
it<00:05:12.720> feels<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.050> little<00:05:13.170> bit<00:05:13.320> heavier<00:05:13.380> than<00:05:14.130> a

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
it feels a little bit heavier than a

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.250 
it feels a little bit heavier than a
Galaxy<00:05:14.580> s3<00:05:14.700> but<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.510> mean<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.780> has<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.990> bigger

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
Galaxy s3 but I mean it has a bigger

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.820 
Galaxy s3 but I mean it has a bigger
battery<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:16.890> that's<00:05:17.460> nothing<00:05:17.760> weird

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
battery so that's nothing weird

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.630 
battery so that's nothing weird
