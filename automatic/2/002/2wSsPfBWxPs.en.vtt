00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.390
 good afternoon today we will continue 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.280
 develop the theme of Lego brick production 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.320
 I only other more traditional for 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.810
 of our materials latitudes in particular we 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.240
 let's talk brick production from 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.610
 industrial waste during crushing 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.980
 stones in quarries accumulates huge 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.790
 the amount of waste in the form of sills 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 the fact is that the product fraction is like 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.829
 Rule stones in size from 5 millimeters 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.470
 fraction from zero to five millimeters 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.320
 that a sufficiently large volume to be 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.020
 inevitably remain with crushing often 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.720
 not used at all or her 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.400
 use is extremely limited on 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.920
 many quarries over the years of their work 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.500
 literally millions have accumulated 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.610
 tons of these calving from strength either not worth it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 nothing is always conditional 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.759
 there are always transportation costs and 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 costs associated with loading these 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.960
 assets 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.049
 either these assets are extremely cheap at 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.420
 in fact the accumulation of this waste in 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.609
 dumps it's a big ecological 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.850
 problem that we can help solve 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.069
 using our technology and so from 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.450
 waste that is from the forces can 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.350
 produce high quality cladding 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.649
 brick 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.259
 including the brick league we strongly 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.560
 recommend using whole soft 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.539
 sedimentary rock is limestone shell rock 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.189
 marble travertine 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.450
 in some cases you can use and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.459
 other sedimentary rocks 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.819
 particular dolomite has its own 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.920
 features soft breeds beautiful 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.990
 compacted at high pressures and from 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.729
 they make a very high quality brick 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.080
 with brand strength of 200 and above then 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.660
 there is absolutely easy to get 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.599
 brick with vintage strength and 250 and 300 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.110
 i.e. this is not some kind of exception this 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.750
 the rule 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.130
 besides this brick is extremely 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.500
 low water absorption often 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.350
 that's 34 percent so it is much 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.720
 below the guest that brings some 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.170
 difficulty even sometimes when laying quaker 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 sad these difficulties are solved 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.460
 most importantly because of the low here 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.390
 this water absorption this brick has 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.840
 excellent frost resistance that is it 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.520
 maintains 100 cycles and more and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.910
 this brick is beautiful 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.620
 geometry high surface quality 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 there is the usual ordinary brick there 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.420
 facing brick of this and the name is 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.640
 of these soft rock assets due to 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.440
 their natural plasticity under high 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.820
 pressure you can get a brick with a very 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.459
 just very beautiful bricks from very 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.030
 ugly geometry and smooth edges 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.980
 such brick are perfect for 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.709
 facades for external some works for 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.019
 decor and so on then there is such a brick 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.850
 always more expensive than ordinary private 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:35.680
 brick and it costs more what kind of image 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.420
 eat three times and up 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.940
 The important point is that with 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.350
 brick production using this technology 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.390
 only about thirty are used 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.140
 percent of energy which is usually 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.140
 spent on the production of bricks in 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.930
 jig technology where about that from 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.140
 brick firing 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.769
 most countries of the world go to their 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.370
 sunset 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.299
 but not everywhere and not equally everywhere 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.910
 i.e 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.100
 but in places where expensive 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.760
 energy where expensive gas is 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.099
 is an absolute rule 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.230
 here's the kiln bricks now 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.400
 going through new arina sand 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.820
 let's say so in iran and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.889
 in usa to usa on this until recently 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.039
 past almost all closed 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.560
 factories but they again open connections with 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:34.960
 the fact that they have become cheaper gas and so for 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.030
 brick production and for this 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.930
 technology required from sedimentary forces 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.210
 rocks with a fraction of 0 2 3 millimeters with 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.669
 adding about 9 10 percent 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.530
 cement and iron oxide required 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.150
 pigment 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.080
 only if needed 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.250
 some sort of painted products 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.720
 products are very important point is 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.550
 Messi adequately mixed with a mixture of 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.740
 very small and therefore 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 the particles are small and in order to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.440
 cement is well mixed with inert 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.449
 materials that are very small 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.199
 special mixers required 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.849
 Kira Mihan activator but it is separate 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.760
 topic for discussion 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.110
 we'll probably talk about that too 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.240
 there is what mixers Mihan 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:27.510
 activators which are very important 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.770
 component in brick making and so 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.139
 as for the press itself 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.210
 equipment necessary for 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.320
 brick production from here these 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.870
 rock assets then usually 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.050
 need pressing force 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.030
 from 80 100 tons and one standard brick 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.650
 standard brick as always with us in 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:54.940
 250 by 120 by 65 is the Soviet guest and 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:58.780
 as regards the specific pressures 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.760
 this pressure is at least from 220 250 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.740
 kilogram per square centimeter too 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.130
 severe pressure 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.880
 and up to 300 400 kilograms per centimeter 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.870
 square product surface we 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.979
 we produce a wide range of presses for 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.380
 the release of such a high-quality 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.720
 facing bricks and waste 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.580
 all our presses are automatic and 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.210
 collected from the best quality 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.389
 components 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.169
 our press have different options and 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.520
 modifications the fastest of them have 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.780
 just phenomenal speed 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.780
 work time cycle for some 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.400
 of our fit compound 45 seconds but 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.190
 for most of our presses time 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.490
 cycle is order under order 9 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.860
 10 seconds less 11 that is it is enough 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:53.880
 fast and high performance 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:57.400
 presses that really have such 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.110
 such high speed our press by 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.479
 customer request are completed 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.150
 automatic depositors systems 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.419
 automatic dosing of raw materials and 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.860
 wet processing cameras which 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.710
 also support 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:15.430
 auto mode defined 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:18.479
 modes and so erase the following if you 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:22.930
 will be used as raw material 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:25.830
 screenings from crushing rocks you need 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.500
 powerful press that will be able to 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:32.560
 provide the right you need the highest 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.370
 pressure indicators use 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.780
 waste from crushing sedimentary rocks in 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.270
 as a raw material for brick production 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.380
 it's a great way 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.800
 environmentally friendly and profitable 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:49.919
 business desired success your business 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.919
 from the blood of your such a machine and the novel of wolves
