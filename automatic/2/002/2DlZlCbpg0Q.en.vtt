the<00:00:00.780> next<00:00:01.050> time<00:00:01.230> you<00:00:01.380> buy<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.560> can<00:00:01.920> soft<00:00:02.280> drink

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659 
the next time you buy a can soft drink

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.960 
the next time you buy a can soft drink
consider<00:00:03.659> this<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.710> aluminum<00:00:05.250> can<00:00:05.310> will

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
consider this that aluminum can will

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.810 
consider this that aluminum can will
always<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:06.690> recyclable<00:00:07.610> unlike<00:00:08.610> plastic

always be recyclable unlike plastic

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.839 
always be recyclable unlike plastic
aluminum<00:00:09.690> never<00:00:10.200> deteriorates<00:00:10.670> no<00:00:11.670> matter

aluminum never deteriorates no matter

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
aluminum never deteriorates no matter
how<00:00:12.090> often<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.660> melted<00:00:13.080> down<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> used

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
how often it's melted down and used

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.290

again aluminum cans are so lightweight

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
again aluminum cans are so lightweight
that<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.320> hard<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> believe<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.310> made
