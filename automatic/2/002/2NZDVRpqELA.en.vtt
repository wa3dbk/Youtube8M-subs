we<00:01:57.360> start<00:01:57.630> from<00:01:57.660> scotts<00:01:58.020> from<00:01:58.470> zero<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
we start from scotts from zero from the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.570 
we start from scotts from zero from the
ground<00:01:59.640> up

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.999 

compare<00:02:03.450> Ian<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> welding<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:07.009> we

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
compare Ian I'm the welding for me we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
compare Ian I'm the welding for me we
actually<00:02:08.220> lay<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.729> our<00:02:08.759> chances<00:02:09.330> we'll<00:02:09.750> start

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually lay out our chances we'll start

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
actually lay out our chances we'll start
building<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.979> walls<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:13.020> after<00:02:13.740> we've

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
building the walls and then after we've

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
building the walls and then after we've
got<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> walls<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.580> back<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.060> front<00:02:15.240> end

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
got the walls are back in the front end

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.700 
got the walls are back in the front end
then<00:02:15.750> we'll<00:02:15.900> start<00:02:16.080> showing<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.500> all<00:02:16.560> together

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
then we'll start showing it all together

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.330 
then we'll start showing it all together
and<00:02:17.130> then<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:18.120> put<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.390> roof<00:02:18.570> on

just measure out what I need to do we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.880 
just measure out what I need to do we
usually<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> metal<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.140> pig<00:03:12.470> pallets

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
usually get the metal in the pig pallets

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.310 
usually get the metal in the pig pallets
and<00:03:13.300> most<00:03:14.300> time<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.570> have<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.750> culties<00:03:15.200> me

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
and most time we have the culties me

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
and most time we have the culties me
down<00:03:17.230> jetset<00:03:18.230> they<00:03:18.440> order<00:03:18.680> no<00:03:18.860> screws<00:03:19.160> is
