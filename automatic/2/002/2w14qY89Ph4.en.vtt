but a better good news I've got a nice

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.649 
but a better good news I've got a nice
pair<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:48.990> feet<00:04:49.259> go<00:04:49.949> out<00:04:49.979> with<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.580> he<00:04:51.270> puts

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
pair of feet go out with you and he puts

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.869 
pair of feet go out with you and he puts
them<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.349> I<00:04:52.530> was<00:04:52.770> thinking<00:04:53.220> right<00:04:53.250> first

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
them on and I was thinking right first

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.490 
them on and I was thinking right first
of<00:04:54.030> all<00:04:54.150> washing<00:04:54.900> up<00:04:55.020> what<00:04:55.199> would<00:04:55.319> that<00:04:55.440> be

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
of all washing up what would that be

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.430 
of all washing up what would that be
like<00:04:57.169> steep<00:04:58.169> I<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.940> tricky<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:01.020> then<00:05:01.349> the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
like steep I be tricky and then the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.279 
like steep I be tricky and then the
second<00:05:01.800> thing<00:05:01.830> was<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:03.240> probably<00:05:03.629> ruined<00:05:03.900> that

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
second thing was it probably ruined that

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.740 
second thing was it probably ruined that
sort<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> shape<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.979> your<00:05:05.009> jumper<00:05:05.750> yes

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
sort of the shape of your jumper yes

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.540 
sort of the shape of your jumper yes
he's<00:05:06.990> putting<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.289> feet<00:05:07.469> for<00:05:07.650> them<00:05:07.800> yeah<00:05:08.310> and

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
he's putting the feet for them yeah and

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.980 
he's putting the feet for them yeah and
then<00:05:08.819> I<00:05:08.849> thought<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.389> could<00:05:09.719> still<00:05:10.250> cycle<00:05:11.250> in

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
then I thought I could still cycle in

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.899

the thing like you'd be really fast well

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.439 
the thing like you'd be really fast well
that's<00:05:17.580> what<00:05:17.729> i<00:05:17.759> was<00:05:17.819> thinking<00:05:17.879> i<00:05:18.150> thought<00:05:18.330> i

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
that's what i was thinking i thought i

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.879 
that's what i was thinking i thought i
could<00:05:18.629> still<00:05:18.840> cycle<00:05:19.409> cuz<00:05:19.530> i<00:05:19.590> could<00:05:19.710> balance

could still cycle cuz i could balance

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.170 
could still cycle cuz i could balance
and<00:05:20.310> then<00:05:20.400> i<00:05:20.430> thought<00:05:20.639> but<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.849> only<00:05:20.969> thing<00:05:21.060> is

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
and then i thought but the only thing is

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.950 
and then i thought but the only thing is
i<00:05:21.300> probably<00:05:21.539> couldn't<00:05:21.840> pull<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.050> brakes

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
i probably couldn't pull the brakes

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.020 
i probably couldn't pull the brakes
because<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.110> thought<00:05:25.710> things<00:05:26.099> yeah<00:05:26.310> yeah<00:05:26.639> and

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
because I thought things yeah yeah and

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.670

then<00:05:27.300> like<00:05:27.599> you<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.810> thought<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.409> then<00:05:28.560> again

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680
