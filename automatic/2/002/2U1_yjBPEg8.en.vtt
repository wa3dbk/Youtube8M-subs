00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
easy week for him he's probably gonna be

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.179 
easy week for him he's probably gonna be
off<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.659> motorcycle<00:01:40.899> but<00:01:41.439> what<00:01:41.859> does<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.069> look

a<00:01:46.600> lot<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.049> mean<00:01:47.729> before<00:01:48.729> Anaheim<00:01:49.299> one<00:01:49.539> in<00:01:49.810> 07<00:01:50.439> he

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
a lot I mean before Anaheim one in 07 he

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.709 
a lot I mean before Anaheim one in 07 he
was<00:01:51.100> broken<00:01:51.670> way<00:01:51.850> worse<00:01:52.060> than<00:01:52.090> he<00:01:52.329> was<00:01:52.359> right

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
was broken way worse than he was right

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.779 
was broken way worse than he was right
now<00:01:52.869> he<00:01:52.929> had<00:01:53.170> seven<00:01:53.530> days<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.859> heal<00:01:54.039> up<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.549> and

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
now he had seven days to heal up and and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.749 
now he had seven days to heal up and and
he<00:01:55.299> finished<00:01:55.479> third<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.350> if<00:01:56.649> he<00:01:57.249> could<00:01:57.459> kind<00:01:57.700> of

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
he finished third so if he could kind of

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.419 
he finished third so if he could kind of
stay<00:01:57.969> on<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:59.289> healing<00:01:59.799> schedule<00:02:00.279> that

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
stay on that that healing schedule that

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.129 
stay on that that healing schedule that
he<00:02:00.520> did<00:02:00.700> know<00:02:01.029> seven<00:02:01.479> we'll<00:02:01.659> see<00:02:01.869> what<00:02:02.020> happens

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
he did know seven we'll see what happens

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.199 
he did know seven we'll see what happens
I<00:02:02.499> mean<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:03.189> can't<00:02:03.429> really<00:02:03.639> predict<00:02:03.999> anything

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
I mean you can't really predict anything

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.989 
I mean you can't really predict anything
at<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.600> point<00:02:04.719> but<00:02:05.499> with<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> rider<00:02:06.639> with<00:02:06.850> that

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
at this point but with a rider with that

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:08.430 
at this point but with a rider with that
much<00:02:07.149> heart<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.600> mean<00:02:07.779> we're<00:02:07.990> hoping<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
much heart I mean we're hoping for the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.440 
much heart I mean we're hoping for the
best<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.160> mean<00:02:09.369> we're<00:02:09.819> happy<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.269> leaving
