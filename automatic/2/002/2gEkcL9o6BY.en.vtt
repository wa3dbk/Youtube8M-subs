00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.190 

for<00:00:03.179> us<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:03.480> kind<00:00:03.659> of<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.899> extraordinary

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
for us it kind of is extraordinary

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.660 
for us it kind of is extraordinary
because<00:00:04.500> it's<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.859> one<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.160> keeps<00:00:05.279> us<00:00:05.460> alive

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
because it's the one that keeps us alive

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.750 
because it's the one that keeps us alive
so<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.150> sort<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.330> important<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.109> sense

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
so it's sort of important in that sense

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.070 
so it's sort of important in that sense
but<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> probably<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
but one of the one of the probably the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.330 
but one of the one of the probably the
biggest<00:00:10.260> lesson<00:00:10.440> that's<00:00:10.830> come<00:00:11.190> out<00:00:11.219> of

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
biggest lesson that's come out of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.879 
biggest lesson that's come out of
astronomy<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:11.969> last<00:00:12.240> 500<00:00:12.450> years<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
astronomy in the last 500 years is the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.169 
astronomy in the last 500 years is the
fact<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.219> we're<00:00:14.549> really<00:00:14.759> nothing<00:00:15.150> special

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
fact that we're really nothing special

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210 
fact that we're really nothing special
you<00:00:15.929> know<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.199> used<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.500> think<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.190> earth

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you know we used to think that the earth

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
you know we used to think that the earth
was<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.580> center<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> universe<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.720> then

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
was the center of the universe and then

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.210 
was the center of the universe and then
actually<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.260> discovered<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.710> isn't<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> Sun

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
actually we discovered it isn't the Sun

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
actually we discovered it isn't the Sun
is<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.939> center<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> solar<00:00:21.480> system<00:00:21.810> at

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
is is the center of the solar system at

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.390 
is is the center of the solar system at
least<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> while<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.070> thought<00:00:23.250> well

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
least then for a while we thought well

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.470 
least then for a while we thought well
maybe<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.789> Sun<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> center<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
maybe the Sun is the center of the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.730 
maybe the Sun is the center of the
universe<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.170> discovered<00:00:25.529> actually

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
universe and then we discovered actually

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
universe and then we discovered actually
no<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> Suns<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.400> boring<00:00:26.910> suburbs<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
no the Suns in the boring suburbs of a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
no the Suns in the boring suburbs of a
galaxy<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> things

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
galaxy and so on so one of the things

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
galaxy and so on so one of the things
sort<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> slightly<00:00:30.300> depressing<00:00:30.660> lessons<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
sort of slightly depressing lessons of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
sort of slightly depressing lessons of
astronomy<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.669> nothing

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
astronomy is we're really nothing

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
astronomy is we're really nothing
special<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> sense<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.770> suppose<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
special and in that sense I suppose it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.440 
special and in that sense I suppose it
really<00:00:35.579> shouldn't<00:00:35.760> come<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> surprise<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
really shouldn't come as a surprise that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
really shouldn't come as a surprise that
the<00:00:36.690> sun's<00:00:36.899> nothing<00:00:37.290> special<00:00:37.500> either<00:00:37.800> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the sun's nothing special either it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.549 
the sun's nothing special either it's
just<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.340> many<00:00:38.610> billions<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> other<00:00:39.300> stars

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
really big massive stars well there are

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
really big massive stars well there are

Roman mythology one of the useful

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.249 
Roman mythology one of the useful
symbols<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> symbol<00:01:10.229> that

symbols that we use is the symbol that

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.800 
symbols that we use is the symbol that
represents<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.100> Sun<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.180> Sun<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
represents the Sun because the Sun is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
represents the Sun because the Sun is
one<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.290> near<00:01:13.619> benchmarks<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.640> something

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
one of our near benchmarks for something

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.810 
one of our near benchmarks for something
that's<00:01:15.210> big<00:01:15.509> something<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.500> massive<00:01:17.039> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that's big something that's massive so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
that's big something that's massive so
sometimes<00:01:18.539> when<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.840> talk<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.410> mass<00:01:19.649> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sometimes when we talk about the mass of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.639 
sometimes when we talk about the mass of
large<00:01:20.310> astronomical<00:01:20.700> objects<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.110> simply<00:01:22.530> add

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
large astronomical objects we simply add

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.740 
large astronomical objects we simply add
up<00:01:22.679> how<00:01:23.130> many<00:01:23.190> masses<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> Sun<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> would

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
up how many masses of the Sun it would

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.050 
up how many masses of the Sun it would
take<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.200> make<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> object<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> mean

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
take to make that object so here I mean

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.219 
take to make that object so here I mean
one<00:01:27.179> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> things<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.780> often<00:01:28.020> put

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
one of the things that you often put

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
one of the things that you often put
kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.740> end<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.069> textbook<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
kind of at the end of a textbook is just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.620 
kind of at the end of a textbook is just
a<00:01:29.970> bunch<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> useful<00:01:30.780> numbers<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.800> one<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.069> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
a bunch of useful numbers and one of the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.969 
a bunch of useful numbers and one of the
sets<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.690> numbers<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.080> astronomers<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:34.619> all

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
sets of numbers that astronomers use all

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.040 
sets of numbers that astronomers use all
the<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.610> things<00:01:36.240> relating<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> Sun

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
the time are things relating to the Sun

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.510 
the time are things relating to the Sun
so<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.409> example<00:01:37.679> we<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.800> from<00:01:37.950> weightings<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so for example we are from weightings in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
so for example we are from weightings in
units<00:01:39.149> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.330> mass<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> Sun<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:39.899> there's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
units of the mass of the Sun so there's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200 
units of the mass of the Sun so there's
the<00:01:40.350> mass<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> Sun<00:01:40.950> quoted<00:01:41.819> to<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> number

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the mass of the Sun quoted to the number

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.460 
the mass of the Sun quoted to the number
of<00:01:42.300> significant<00:01:42.780> figures<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.080> know<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
of significant figures we know it so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
of significant figures we know it so
it's<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.800> 2<00:01:44.280> times<00:01:44.850> 10<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> 30<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it's about 2 times 10 to the 30 to with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's about 2 times 10 to the 30 to with
30<00:01:46.259> zeros<00:01:46.740> after<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.100> kilograms<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
30 zeros after it kilograms is the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
30 zeros after it kilograms is the
radius<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> Sun<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:50.219> is<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.579> 700

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
radius of the Sun which is about 700

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.760 
radius of the Sun which is about 700
million<00:01:51.329> meters<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.049> there's<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
million meters and there's the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
million meters and there's the
luminosity<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> Sun<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.630> 3<00:01:55.200> times

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
luminosity of the Sun which is 3 times

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.039 
luminosity of the Sun which is 3 times
10<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> 2603<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.909> 26<00:01:57.360> zeros<00:01:57.689> after<00:01:57.869> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
10 to the 2603 with 26 zeros after it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
10 to the 2603 with 26 zeros after it
what's<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.039> means<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
what's so that means if you look in a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.950 
what's so that means if you look in a
textbook<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.770> number<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.670> see

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
textbook and you see a number you see

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
textbook and you see a number you see
10,000<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> next<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> big<00:02:05.579> M

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
10,000 and next to it you see a big M

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.969 
10,000 and next to it you see a big M
with<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.479> symbol<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.140> circle<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> dot

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
with this symbol a circle with the dot

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.069 
with this symbol a circle with the dot
in<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.850> means<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.539> whatever<00:02:09.750> they're

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
in it that means that whatever they're

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.250 
in it that means that whatever they're
talking<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.619> weighs<00:02:11.329> 10,000<00:02:12.329> times<00:02:12.570> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
talking about weighs 10,000 times the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
talking about weighs 10,000 times the
mass<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.500> our<00:02:13.769> Sun<00:02:13.829> so<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> symbol<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.880> we

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
mass of our Sun so the symbol that we

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.699 
mass of our Sun so the symbol that we
use<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.420> there's<00:02:15.630> an<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.840> circle<00:02:16.320> with<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> dot

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
use is there's an all circle with a dot

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.720 
use is there's an all circle with a dot
in<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:16.950> middle<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
in the middle of it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.310 
in the middle of it
astronomers<00:02:18.269> tend<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> refer<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> 0<00:02:19.049> dot

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
astronomers tend to refer to a 0 dot

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.229 
astronomers tend to refer to a 0 dot
which<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.609> little<00:02:20.820> suffix<00:02:21.150> that

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
which is just the little suffix that

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.960 
which is just the little suffix that
comes<00:02:21.510> after<00:02:21.780> all<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.049> things<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:23.430> lot<00:02:23.940> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
comes after all these things a lot of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.270 
comes after all these things a lot of
times<00:02:24.090> people<00:02:24.630> ask<00:02:24.780> me<00:02:25.049> what's<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> closest

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
times people ask me what's the closest

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910 
times people ask me what's the closest
star<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> universe<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.720> say<00:02:27.930> well<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
star in the universe and I say well the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.970 
star in the universe and I say well the
Sun<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.079> easily<00:02:31.320> forgotten<00:02:31.859> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
Sun it's kind of easily forgotten that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.740 
Sun it's kind of easily forgotten that
the<00:02:32.160> star<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.640> our<00:02:32.760> Sun<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.269> actually<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.660> star

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the star that our Sun is actually a star

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.849 
the star that our Sun is actually a star
is<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:35.010> typical<00:02:35.910> star<00:02:36.150> well<00:02:37.079> no<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.530> we

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
is it a typical star well no because we

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.970 
is it a typical star well no because we
live<00:02:38.160> around<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.900> compared<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:40.829> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
live around it but compared to all the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.770 
live around it but compared to all the
other<00:02:41.100> stars<00:02:41.459> we've<00:02:41.700> actually<00:02:41.880> observed<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
other stars we've actually observed it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.620 
other stars we've actually observed it
is<00:02:43.340> typical<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.760> really<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.090> about<00:02:45.269> as<00:02:45.420> bog

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
is typical it really it's about as bog

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.280 
is typical it really it's about as bog
standards<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.500> yeah<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> mean<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
standards you can get yeah I mean it's a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
standards you can get yeah I mean it's a
star's<00:02:49.290> you're<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.130> range<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.519> masses<00:02:50.700> of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
star's you're the range of masses of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.059 
star's you're the range of masses of
stars<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.450> example<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.319> tend<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.800> from

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
stars for example they tend to go from

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.250 
stars for example they tend to go from
about<00:02:53.340> 1/10<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.150> mass<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> Sun<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:55.050> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
about 1/10 the mass of the Sun up to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.250 
about 1/10 the mass of the Sun up to
maybe

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
maybe

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.020 
maybe
a<00:02:56.319> hundred<00:02:56.620> times<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.069> mass<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> Sun<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:57.819> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
a hundred times the mass of the Sun is a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.420 
a hundred times the mass of the Sun is a
really<00:02:58.390> massive<00:02:58.720> star<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.950> Sun<00:03:00.099> sort<00:03:00.370> of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
really massive star so the Sun sort of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.589 
really massive star so the Sun sort of
right<00:03:00.579> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.819> middle<00:03:00.970> where<00:03:01.180> somewhere

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
right in the middle where somewhere

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.789 
right in the middle where somewhere
there<00:03:01.930> are<00:03:02.019> some<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.319> are<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.470> bit<00:03:02.650> less

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
there are some that are a bit less

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.289 
there are some that are a bit less
massive<00:03:03.099> there's<00:03:03.400> some<00:03:03.519> more<00:03:03.819> massive<00:03:04.150> there

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
massive there's some more massive there

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.339 
massive there's some more massive there
are<00:03:04.360> some<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.629> brighter<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.140> are<00:03:05.230> some

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
are some of the brighter there are some

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.899 
are some of the brighter there are some
that<00:03:05.470> are<00:03:05.530> fainter<00:03:05.920> but<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.459> really<00:03:06.579> is<00:03:06.760> pretty

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
that are fainter but it really is pretty

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.690 
that are fainter but it really is pretty
typical<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.500> star<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.189> a<00:03:09.849> big<00:03:10.180> ball<00:03:11.079> of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
typical so a star is a big ball of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.780 
typical so a star is a big ball of
nuclear<00:03:12.700> fusion<00:03:12.970> there's<00:03:13.659> lots<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.170> gases

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
nuclear fusion there's lots of gases

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.550 
nuclear fusion there's lots of gases
that<00:03:15.790> are<00:03:15.849> condensed<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.629> center<00:03:16.930> nuclear

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that are condensed in the center nuclear

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.869 
that are condensed in the center nuclear
reactions<00:03:18.040> happen<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.519> that's<00:03:18.640> where

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
reactions happen and that's where

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.149 
reactions happen and that's where
chemical<00:03:19.720> elements<00:03:20.140> are<00:03:20.290> created<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.980> that's

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
chemical elements are created so that's

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.550 
chemical elements are created so that's
where<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.430> build<00:03:21.640> your<00:03:22.319> carbon<00:03:23.319> and<00:03:23.470> your

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
where you build your carbon and your

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.229 
where you build your carbon and your
bigger<00:03:23.769> elements<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.489> fill<00:03:24.640> up<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.879> periodic

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
bigger elements and fill up the periodic

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.640 
bigger elements and fill up the periodic
table<00:03:25.659> there<00:03:25.810> when<00:03:26.109> there<00:03:26.230> are<00:03:26.290> astronomers

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
table there when there are astronomers

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.110

who spend their entire career studying
the<00:03:28.329> Sun<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> reason<00:03:29.950> why<00:03:30.040> they<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> is

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
the Sun and the reason why they do it is

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.430 
the Sun and the reason why they do it is
partly<00:03:31.180> because<00:03:31.329> actually<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:31.840> have<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:31.989> sort

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
partly because actually we have a sort

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.660 
partly because actually we have a sort
of<00:03:32.470> vested<00:03:32.829> interest<00:03:33.099> in<00:03:33.190> knowing<00:03:33.340> what<00:03:33.549> the

of vested interest in knowing what the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.740 
of vested interest in knowing what the
Sun<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.909> going<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> do<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.420> Sun<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.659> going

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
Sun is going to do if the Sun is going

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.910 
Sun is going to do if the Sun is going
to<00:03:34.840> go<00:03:34.930> out<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.319> would<00:03:35.440> be<00:03:35.500> useful<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.829> know

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
to go out it would be useful to know

to go out it would be useful to know
about<00:03:36.129> it<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.090> isn't<00:03:37.359> nice<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.780> point<00:03:37.959> out<00:03:38.139> when

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
about it it isn't nice to point out when

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.649 
about it it isn't nice to point out when
you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.069> these<00:03:39.250> nuclear<00:03:39.940> reactions<00:03:40.480> they

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
you have these nuclear reactions they

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.059 
you have these nuclear reactions they
actually<00:03:41.019> release<00:03:41.349> little<00:03:41.650> bits<00:03:41.799> of<00:03:41.920> energy

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069

Sun once a photon escapes it actually

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
Sun once a photon escapes it actually

astronomers<00:04:04.359> are<00:04:04.419> just<00:04:04.540> interested<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
astronomers are just interested in the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.839 
astronomers are just interested in the
Sun<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:05.260> because<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.769> typical<00:04:06.129> star<00:04:06.310> he

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
Sun just because it's a typical star he

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:07.619 
Sun just because it's a typical star he
just<00:04:07.030> happens<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.239> be<00:04:07.329> one<00:04:07.510> that's

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
just happens to be one that's

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.800 
just happens to be one that's
conveniently<00:04:08.260> close<00:04:08.379> in<00:04:09.010> physical<00:04:10.000> size<00:04:10.419> the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
conveniently close in physical size the

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.250 
conveniently close in physical size the
Sun<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:12.250> big<00:04:12.549> something<00:04:12.970> like<00:04:13.329> 700

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
Sun is very big something like 700

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.789 
Sun is very big something like 700
thousand<00:04:14.650> kilometres<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.190> don't<00:04:15.699> you<00:04:16.209> can<00:04:16.359> take

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
thousand kilometres I don't you can take

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.500 
thousand kilometres I don't you can take
100<00:04:17.799> earths<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.459> line<00:04:18.820> them<00:04:19.000> up<00:04:19.030> next<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.479> each

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
100 earths and line them up next to each

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.569 
100 earths and line them up next to each
other<00:04:19.780> across<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.260> diameter<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.829> Sun<00:04:21.010> so

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
other across the diameter of the Sun so

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.800 
other across the diameter of the Sun so
it's<00:04:21.760> it's<00:04:22.389> huge

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
it's it's huge

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.420 
it's it's huge
so<00:04:23.410> if<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.830> learn<00:04:23.979> something<00:04:24.250> about

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
so if you want to learn something about

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.129 
so if you want to learn something about
the<00:04:24.669> sort<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.849> generic<00:04:25.120> properties<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.870> stars

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
the sort of generic properties of stars

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.409 
the sort of generic properties of stars
then<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.190> Sun<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.520> very<00:04:27.580> good<00:04:27.820> example<00:04:27.940> just

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
then the Sun is a very good example just

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.939 
then the Sun is a very good example just
because<00:04:28.630> it's<00:04:28.990> right<00:04:29.199> nearby<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.740> we<00:04:29.800> can

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
because it's right nearby and we can

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.010 
because it's right nearby and we can
study<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.340> in<00:04:30.479> excruciating<00:04:31.479> detail<00:04:31.599> we<00:04:31.900> can

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
study it in excruciating detail we can

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.240 
study it in excruciating detail we can
learn<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.169> whole<00:04:32.410> lot<00:04:32.470> more<00:04:32.650> about<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.099> Sun

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
learn a whole lot more about the Sun

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.219 
learn a whole lot more about the Sun
than<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.610> about<00:04:33.820> any<00:04:33.970> other<00:04:34.150> star<00:04:34.419> when

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
than we can about any other star when

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.490 
than we can about any other star when
when<00:04:36.010> we<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:36.310> solar<00:04:36.639> flares<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.210> prominences

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
when we see solar flares and prominences

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.520 
when we see solar flares and prominences
from<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.680> surface<00:04:38.979> of<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.250> Sun<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:40.000> can<00:04:40.030> fit

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
from the surface of the Sun you can fit

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.080 
from the surface of the Sun you can fit
save<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.710> entire<00:04:41.919> earth<00:04:42.220> inside<00:04:42.789> of<00:04:42.970> those

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
save the entire earth inside of those

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.570 
save the entire earth inside of those
prominences<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.349> whole<00:04:44.530> Sun<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.130> just

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
prominences so the whole Sun is just

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.430 
prominences so the whole Sun is just
massive<00:04:45.849> you<00:04:46.599> can<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:46.840> mean<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.110> need<00:04:47.260> very

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
massive you can I mean you need very

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.659 
massive you can I mean you need very
specialized<00:04:47.949> equipment<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.400> really

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
specialized equipment you really

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.430 
specialized equipment you really
absolutely<00:04:49.210> do<00:04:49.330> not<00:04:49.479> want<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.720> go<00:04:49.930> staring<00:04:50.289> at

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
absolutely do not want to go staring at

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.409 
absolutely do not want to go staring at
the<00:04:50.560> Sun<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.460> absolutely<00:04:51.760> don't<00:04:52.150> want<00:04:52.360> to

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
the Sun and you absolutely don't want to

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.250 
the Sun and you absolutely don't want to
look<00:04:52.479> through<00:04:52.599> a<00:04:52.690> telescope<00:04:52.720> or<00:04:53.199> binoculars

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
look through a telescope or binoculars

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.320 
look through a telescope or binoculars
at<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.070> Sun<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.340> can<00:04:54.490> really<00:04:54.789> do<00:04:54.909> your<00:04:55.090> eyes

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
at the Sun you can really do your eyes

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.939 
at the Sun you can really do your eyes
permanent<00:04:55.870> damage<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.260> way<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:56.409> don't<00:04:56.680> do<00:04:56.800> it

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
permanent damage that way so don't do it

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.310 
permanent damage that way so don't do it
but<00:04:57.729> with<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.940> appropriate<00:04:58.360> equipment<00:04:58.510> you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
but with the appropriate equipment you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.170 
but with the appropriate equipment you
really<00:04:59.590> can<00:04:59.770> so<00:04:59.949> we<00:05:00.310> use<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.699> know<00:05:00.789> you<00:05:00.849> never

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
really can so we use you know you never

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
really can so we use you know you never
look<00:05:01.360> directly<00:05:01.870> at<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.260> Sun<00:05:02.289> but<00:05:02.650> astronomers

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
look directly at the Sun but astronomers

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.440 
look directly at the Sun but astronomers
use<00:05:03.280> detectors<00:05:03.760> which<00:05:03.909> are<00:05:04.000> capable<00:05:04.360> of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
use detectors which are capable of

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.790 
use detectors which are capable of
dealing<00:05:04.570> with<00:05:04.719> those<00:05:04.900> incredibly<00:05:05.380> high<00:05:05.560> light

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
dealing with those incredibly high light

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.140 
dealing with those incredibly high light
levels<00:05:05.830> without<00:05:06.370> getting<00:05:06.610> damaged<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.060> way

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
levels without getting damaged the way

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.290 
levels without getting damaged the way
and<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.389> would<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:08.500> can<00:05:08.710> actually

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
and I would and can actually

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.610 
and I would and can actually
Brod<00:05:09.419> enormous<00:05:10.139> amounts<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.470> information

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
Brod enormous amounts of information

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.260 
Brod enormous amounts of information
about<00:05:11.159> the<00:05:11.280> Sun<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.639> really<00:05:11.879> can't<00:05:12.090> see

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
about the Sun that we really can't see

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.119 
about the Sun that we really can't see
in<00:05:12.360> any<00:05:12.509> other<00:05:12.599> store<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.229> completely

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
in any other store a completely

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.390 
in any other store a completely
coincidental<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:14.970> in<00:05:15.840> our<00:05:16.530> sky<00:05:16.860> when<00:05:17.250> we

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
coincidental that in our sky when we

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.730 
coincidental that in our sky when we
look<00:05:17.580> out<00:05:17.729> from<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.120> earth<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.720> Sun<00:05:18.990> our<00:05:19.289> Sun

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
look out from the earth the Sun our Sun

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.820 
look out from the earth the Sun our Sun
and<00:05:19.979> our<00:05:20.220> Moon<00:05:20.360> look<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.960> be<00:05:22.080> exactly<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.800> same

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
and our Moon look to be exactly the same

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.029 
and our Moon look to be exactly the same
size<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:24.090> when<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.870> moon<00:05:25.050> crosses<00:05:25.409> in<00:05:25.740> front

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
size so when the moon crosses in front

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.450 
size so when the moon crosses in front
of<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.340> Sun<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:27.030> see<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.240> solar<00:05:27.539> eclipse<00:05:27.720> it's

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
of the Sun we see a solar eclipse it's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.159 
of the Sun we see a solar eclipse it's
completely<00:05:29.460> coincidental<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.509> could<00:05:30.750> be<00:05:30.900> that

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
completely coincidental it could be that

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.779 
completely coincidental it could be that
maybe<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.949> moon<00:05:32.129> was<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.310> little<00:05:32.550> farther

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
maybe if the moon was a little farther

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.520 
maybe if the moon was a little farther
away<00:05:32.970> than<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.449> would<00:05:33.569> look<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.930> lot<00:05:34.169> smaller

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
away than it would look a lot smaller

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.559 
away than it would look a lot smaller
and<00:05:34.919> then<00:05:35.129> we<00:05:35.250> wouldn't<00:05:35.520> see<00:05:35.699> a<00:05:35.729> total<00:05:36.240> solar

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
and then we wouldn't see a total solar

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.990 
and then we wouldn't see a total solar
eclipse
