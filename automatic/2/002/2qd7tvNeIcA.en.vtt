00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
time to kind of figure out what I wanted

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.210

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
to do as an artist I grew up around my

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.430 
to do as an artist I grew up around my
house<00:00:49.430> there<00:00:49.790> was<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.910> lot<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.210> like<00:00:50.930> scrolls

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
house there was a lot of like scrolls

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.760 
house there was a lot of like scrolls
and<00:00:51.860> calligraphic<00:00:52.850> kind<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.750> paintings<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.380> I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
and calligraphic kind of paintings and I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.350 
and calligraphic kind of paintings and I
understood<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.340> importance<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:56.090> the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
understood the importance of the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.209 
understood the importance of the
calligraphy<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.530> guess<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
calligraphy and I guess the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.910 
calligraphy and I guess the
understanding<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.149> gesture<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.469> know<00:01:00.500> I

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
understanding of gesture you know I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.619 
understanding of gesture you know I
didn't<00:01:01.219> realize<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:01.760> at<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:01.910> time<00:01:02.030> but<00:01:02.480> then

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
didn't realize it at the time but then

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.539 
didn't realize it at the time but then
as<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:03.110> got<00:01:03.379> older<00:01:03.559> I'm<00:01:04.009> like<00:01:04.189> wow<00:01:04.309> that's

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
as I got older I'm like wow that's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.050 
as I got older I'm like wow that's
really<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:06.110> know<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.740> art<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.670> I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
really you know that's the art so I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.459 
really you know that's the art so I
wanted<00:01:08.329> to<00:01:08.390> approach<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.200> with<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
wanted to approach that with the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.800 
wanted to approach that with the
painting<00:01:09.709> by<00:01:10.159> creating<00:01:11.060> shapes<00:01:11.389> that<00:01:11.659> were

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
painting by creating shapes that were

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.010 
painting by creating shapes that were
kind<00:01:12.109> of<00:01:12.259> very<00:01:13.069> abstract<00:01:13.639> but<00:01:13.759> then<00:01:14.060> all<00:01:14.359> too

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
kind of very abstract but then all too

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.449 
kind of very abstract but then all too
technically<00:01:15.560> like<00:01:15.770> kind<00:01:16.039> of<00:01:16.130> put<00:01:16.340> together

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459 
technically like kind of put together

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.449 
technically like kind of put together
into<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.179> whole<00:01:17.479> universe<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.409> when<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.130> made

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
into a whole universe and when I made

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.219 
into a whole universe and when I made
those<00:01:19.819> kind<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.149> paintings<00:01:20.569> I<00:01:20.659> realized<00:01:21.079> that

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
those kind of paintings I realized that

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.450

fuse<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:50.700> those<00:02:50.940> things<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
fuse all those things but really in a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.490 
fuse all those things but really in a
gestural<00:02:53.160> way<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.579> my<00:02:53.730> own<00:02:53.880> way<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:55.320> all
