00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:20.770
 In today’s fast-paced and rapidly evolving energy and transportation industry, 

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.023
 The machining of gear parts is crucial. 

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:27.152
 In many applications, gears are the most important, expensive, and processed. 

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.487
 The most time consuming part, 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.198
 Not only strict technical specifications, 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.868
 And production needs are also increasing. 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.705
 For gear manufacturers in all industries, optimizing their gear processing is critical. 

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.751
 The good news is that the industry is booming. 

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:47.255
 The global gear processing industry is enjoying rapid growth. 

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:53.219
 At the same time, it is under tremendous pressure, which is also an opportunity for us to introduce new technologies. 

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.680
 Although for machine tools, in some cases our technology 

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.767
 There are still improvements, and for industry professionals, 

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.185
 We certainly have some shortcomings. 

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.271
 But for the industry, in the manufacturing process 

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:08.651
 Use a more intelligent machine tool and a more powerful combination tool 

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.072
 And the accessories are very helpful. 

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.783
 We are able to improve productivity through 

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:20.121
 To make up for the shortage of employees or labor. 

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.041
 To help customers stay ahead, 

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:27.879
 Sandvik Coromant develops new gear cutting tools and solutions 

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.132
 Investing a lot of time, money and resources, 

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:35.303
 Compared to traditional gear cutting tools and techniques, 

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.682
 Most of our solutions increase productivity by up to 300%. 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.893
 Today, when I talk to our customers about our 

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.313
 When they are new to technology and products, they are convinced of our innovative solutions. 

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:49.442
 This is exactly what we are happy to see. 

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.904
 The customer’s understanding of us stems from our global general processing. 

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.156
 Market leader in the field. 

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:59.703
 And they also know the power behind what we do. 

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.289
 We communicate more than just a promise to our customers. 

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.001
 More importantly, what is behind us 

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.169
 Strong technical strength and economic strength. 

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.796
 And we are far-sighted. 

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.591
 Sandvik Coromant's full range of indexable insert knives 

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.679
 It can help customers complete all kinds of gear milling tasks from roughing to finishing. 

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.016
 In addition, the new technology of Sandvik Coromant is gear milling 

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.435
 Brought a huge change. 

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:28.481
 I will show you an example of machining a gear with a high speed steel hob. 

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:32.402
 This example took a conventional method of processing for 32 minutes. 

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:36.031
 With our new products, processing time is reduced to 4 minutes. 

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:39.826
 Shortened from 32 minutes to just 4 minutes. 

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.204
 This is not an improvement, but a revolution! 

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.874
 Invo-milling process is the gear milling industry 

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.459
 A major technological breakthrough. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.295
 Its purpose is to provide you with full use 

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.797
 The opportunity for this cutting technology, 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.051
 This technology is programmed for five-axis machining. 

00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:00.638
 Gears are produced using this standard and using this combination. 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.309
 Previously, you could only use non-standard tools on a dedicated machine. 

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:08.605
 Now, with the help of special software, you can machine gears on standard machines using standard tools. 

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.399
 To ensure the highest level of R&amp;D, 

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.028
