00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
spots these are what we like to call

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.330 
spots these are what we like to call
wisdom<00:00:17.510> spot<00:00:18.140> if<00:00:18.440> we<00:00:18.530> get<00:00:18.680> them<00:00:18.830> from<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.100> Sun

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340

wisdom spot if we get them from the Sun
you<00:00:19.460> can<00:00:19.610> see<00:00:19.640> we<00:00:20.270> hate<00:00:20.450> them<00:00:20.630> more<00:00:20.840> likely

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
you can see we hate them more likely

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.960 
you can see we hate them more likely
here<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:21.710> less<00:00:21.890> likely<00:00:22.279> on<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.490> underside<00:00:22.939> of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
here and less likely on the underside of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.179 
here and less likely on the underside of
our<00:00:23.150> arm<00:00:23.330> usually<00:00:23.960> on<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.290> top<00:00:24.500> because<00:00:24.800> this

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
our arm usually on the top because this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.429 
our arm usually on the top because this
is<00:00:25.310> where<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:25.550> get<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.820> most<00:00:25.849> sun<00:00:26.270> exposure<00:00:26.660> we

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
is where we get the most sun exposure we

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.660 
is where we get the most sun exposure we
can<00:00:27.560> do<00:00:27.680> something<00:00:28.010> pretty<00:00:28.130> simple<00:00:28.580> with

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
can do something pretty simple with

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.310 
can do something pretty simple with
these<00:00:28.850> this<00:00:29.000> little<00:00:29.330> liquid<00:00:29.630> nitrogen<00:00:29.660> spray

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
these this little liquid nitrogen spray

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.010 
these this little liquid nitrogen spray
this<00:00:30.440> is<00:00:30.560> really<00:00:30.800> cold<00:00:31.100> and<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.980> kind<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:35.020> don't

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
this is really cold and I kind of don't

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.950 
this is really cold and I kind of don't
do<00:00:36.199> it<00:00:36.350> too<00:00:36.620> aggressive<00:00:37.480> but<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.600> actually

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
do it too aggressive but I actually

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.540 
do it too aggressive but I actually
trying<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.620> induce<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.160> little<00:00:40.430> frostbite<00:00:40.879> here

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
trying to induce a little frostbite here

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.889 
trying to induce a little frostbite here
so<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.760> they'll<00:00:43.940> lighten<00:00:44.239> up<00:00:44.390> with<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.660> lot<00:00:44.780> of

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
so that they'll lighten up with a lot of

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.270 
so that they'll lighten up with a lot of
them<00:00:44.989> aren't<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:45.290> difficult<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:45.829> skin<00:00:46.040> enough

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
them aren't as difficult as skin enough

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880 
them aren't as difficult as skin enough
I<00:00:46.399> just<00:00:46.430> freeze<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.090> surface<00:00:47.510> off<00:00:47.770> like<00:00:48.770> it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
I just freeze the surface off like it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.549 
I just freeze the surface off like it
kind<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.100> like<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.280> chemical<00:00:49.610> peel<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:51.350> can

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
kind of like a chemical peel you can

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.610 
kind of like a chemical peel you can
freeze<00:00:51.950> most<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.579> my<00:00:52.700> notes<00:00:53.059> cold<00:00:56.590> take<00:00:57.590> a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
freeze most of my notes cold take a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.650 
freeze most of my notes cold take a
break<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:03.670> don't<00:01:04.670> want<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.910> be<00:01:05.000> very<00:01:05.210> aggressive

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
break I don't want to be very aggressive

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.510 
break I don't want to be very aggressive
with<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:05.899> spray<00:01:06.229> because<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.009> do<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.310> too

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
with this spray because if I do it too

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.609 
with this spray because if I do it too
much<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:07.910> can<00:01:08.090> actually<00:01:08.240> destroy<00:01:09.110> your

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
much I can actually destroy your

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.440 
much I can actually destroy your
melanocytes<00:01:10.130> affair<00:01:10.700> your<00:01:10.850> pigment<00:01:11.270> cells

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
melanocytes affair your pigment cells

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.930 
melanocytes affair your pigment cells
and<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.899> get<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.110> permanent<00:01:12.670> white<00:01:13.670> patch

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and you get a permanent white patch

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.570 
and you get a permanent white patch
there<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:14.899> don't<00:01:15.080> want<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.320> do<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:15.590> you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
there so we don't want to do that you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.520 
there so we don't want to do that you
know<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.840> we're<00:01:17.959> gonna<00:01:18.080> kind<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.350> get<00:01:18.440> the

before some fancies that you want to put

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.029 
before some fancies that you want to put
at<00:01:26.270> least<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.690> probably<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.530> month<00:01:27.800> before

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
at least a probably a month before

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.980 
at least a probably a month before
because<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.759> might<00:01:29.030> be<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.179> little<00:01:29.420> red<00:01:29.599> even

though these little spots for but you
can<00:01:32.209> see<00:01:32.420> I'll<00:01:33.050> do<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.349> side<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.740> then<00:01:33.860> won't

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
can see I'll do this side and then won't

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.169 
can see I'll do this side and then won't
come<00:01:34.160> back<00:01:34.310> you'll<00:01:34.459> see<00:01:34.490> them<00:01:34.729> already<00:01:34.910> have

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
turned darker let's get beat so these

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.380 
turned darker let's get beat so these
are<00:01:39.470> called<00:01:39.709> lentil<00:01:40.190> balls<00:01:40.310> or<00:01:40.670> solo<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.209> for

those sunspots we never call them age
spots<00:01:46.130> that's<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.520> bad<00:01:46.759> word<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:49.310> wisdom<00:01:56.770> we're

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
spots that's a bad word in wisdom we're

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.400 
spots that's a bad word in wisdom we're
just<00:01:57.950> trying<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> get<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:58.700> ones<00:01:58.910> darkest<00:01:59.720> you

general area you can do you know like a
local<00:02:05.780> peel<00:02:05.989> that<00:02:06.380> would<00:02:06.560> potentially<00:02:07.369> be

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
local peel that would potentially be
