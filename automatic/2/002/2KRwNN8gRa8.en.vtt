developing<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.420> wager<00:02:42.750> match<00:02:42.900> game<00:02:43.170> modes<00:02:43.440> we

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
developing the wager match game modes we

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.410 
developing the wager match game modes we
went<00:02:43.890> through<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.130> whole<00:02:44.370> bunch<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.760> ideas<00:02:44.940> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
went through a whole bunch of ideas to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.940 
went through a whole bunch of ideas to
find<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> four<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.380> were<00:02:46.530> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> use

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
find the four that we were going to use

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.509 
find the four that we were going to use
to<00:02:47.820> ship<00:02:48.030> inside<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.570> game<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.109> really<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
to ship inside the game and really if it

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.120 
to ship inside the game and really if it
wasn't<00:02:51.000> people<00:02:51.540> screaming<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.320> joy<00:02:52.799> and
