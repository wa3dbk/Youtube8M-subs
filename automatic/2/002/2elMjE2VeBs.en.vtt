 and today tell you about the lost 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.730
 the vikings the lost vikings is 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.550
 unique heroes as instead of one 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.880
 hero you get three olafa pain yeah 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.770
 Erica Olaf is a kind of tank with him 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.780
 large amount of health as well 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.940
 accelerated health regeneration 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.579
 if it is not in the fight for 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 four seconds 1 8 seconds he does 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.310
 snatch dried apricots and slows it down but injections 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.140
 very small software damage from a black during 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.420
 auto attack he does damage to all 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.020
 opponents behind the goal which he 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.970
 attacks 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.860
 he has an average health a 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.410
 also a short attack range 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.880
 Eric has the smallest amount of health 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.070
 but he has very high speed 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.899
 movement and long range 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.969
 firing combined with high speed 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.759
 movement will help finish the runaway 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.619
 opponents and so these heroes can 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.270
 play by size you can borrow as 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.159
 several lines and run straight 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.260
 heroes they very quickly demolish 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.840
 enemy buildings as well as protect 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.970
 creeps lines but their not minus it is small 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.040
 health reserve let's move on to abilities 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 initially the Vikings have no abilities 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.790
 on the qw buttons of her but they open in 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.860
 talents 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.450
 first ability that opens 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.490
 you want to live know how to spin 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 when used every viking deals 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.090
 damage to all opponents around him 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 This ability will greatly help with 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.650
 stripping the line and also if you put 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.260
 damage to all three heroes on the enemy 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.430
 hero damage will be tangible jump on 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 one and a half second 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.689
 makes all Vikings invulnerable and gives 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.880
 opportunity to fly over opponents 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.830
 This ability is very strong and necessary 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.409
 vikings so how can you use 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.479
 her and fly out oh e opponents who 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.400
 will be for you deadly or control 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.140
 the same mafurion that uses on 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.049
 you root when using the ability 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.540
 jump you will leave them very much increase 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.700
 viking survival nordic power 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.400
 imposes on the Viking shield absorbing 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.739
 a lot of damage the more vikings 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.909
 living the stronger will shield this 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.640
 ability to increase survival 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:15.400
 viking even though she has a great cool down 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.959
 but do not forget for her 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 three restart passive ability 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.189
 Viking which reduces time 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.819
 the revival of all the Vikings to 25 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.370
 percent 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.200
 heroic abilities 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.299
 vikings jumps into the ship and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.670
 shelling the enemy as well as possible 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.680
 fire from a mortar that causes 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.480
 damage to the area the more vikings 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.670
 jumped the ship the more will be y 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.470
 it needs hp to use 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.900
 all the Vikings were nearby 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.819
 but if there was one viking you have so 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.980
 can you use this ability 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.109
 but health will be much less if 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.940
 Drakkar destroy something on the Vikings will 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.980
 the effect of stunning a half 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.239
 seconds this ulta is very strong 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.190
 helps as when pushing 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.709
 so in team fights only requires 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.569
 positioning let's play again one of 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.790
 vikings calls stone gem 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.799
 not immediately called 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 maintain for two seconds after 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.189
 the call is put a stone which 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.810
 revives fully heals and 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.730
 brings all Vikings to him 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.010
 not bad ulta who will revive everyone 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.109
 the vikings have no mounts 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.730
 they have the ability to jump which 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.310
 increases the speed of movement of all 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.909
 vikings at 40 percent move on to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.949
 talents 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.900
 on the first level all talents will do. 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.940
 it all depends on how you want to play 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 Viking stash is suitable if you will 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.750
 stand every viking in line 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.730
 the most you can collect spheres from three 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.980
 lines and greatly increase the regeneration 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.989
 health talent spy games dust 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.329
 Erica disguise and increase the radius 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.790
 Review this talent will do if you 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.470
 erica put just stand on the line he 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.250
 will become in disguise mode and will 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.109
 collect experience 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.209
 and you will occupy the other two 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.400
 another line so you'll get experience 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.379
 from two lines talent is strong 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.720
 will give the opportunity to block 75 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.040
 percent damage auto attack such 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.510
 charges can accumulate 2 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.639
 this talent will increase a little 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.010
 paw survival on the fourth level 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.260
 take the first ability you want to live 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.540
 know how to spin which will raise well 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.879
 the damage of all the vikings is sabotage 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.459
 auto attack erica anti 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.709
 of buildings reduces 5 units of ammunition in 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.479
 for 10 seconds this talent is not bad 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.879
 will be suitable if you are only configured to push 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.979
 lines on the seventh level take the second 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.620
 jump ability on the tenth level 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.539
 raid on drakar I prefer this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.200
 ulta as it is as effective as 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.820
 pushe and in team battles at level 13 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.990
 flaming olaf olaf does damage to all 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.730
 nearby 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.140
 opponents this talent a little 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.210
 will raise damage 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.850
 afterburner and forward when the stock of health 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.200
 viking at less than 50 percent their speed 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.170
 movement increases by 20 percent 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.300
 slightly increase the survival rate but if 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.670
 play all the Vikings at the same time 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.620
 talent impatience is also a blessing 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.360
 effective as auto attacks will 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.190
 reduce the recovery time of all 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.660
 abilities given talent will give 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.150
 ability to live our abilities 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.820
 much more often as will increase the damage 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.650
 so increase survival by 16 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.660
 level big bang theory 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.270
 when allah makes a breakthrough on the enemy 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.670
 he stuns his extra camp 1 8 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.350
 seconds a 16 bit marathon 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.210
 using ability drove 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.460
 viking speed increases by 40 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.500
 percent and then gradually decreases in 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 for four seconds for one second 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.460
 Vikings become unstoppable and 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.320
 gets immunity control given 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.970
 the talent will be quite good on the dragon card not 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.920
 edge as you can very quickly 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.810
 get to shrines simultaneously to 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.180
 several and also we can take on 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.770
 this level the ability of the nordic village 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.140
 at level 20 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.120
 Improve the ul Drakkar now can 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.400
 attack two targets will increase range 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.560
 action mortars twice what will 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.110
 very effective in both push and 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.030
 team battles how to behave in battle 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.740
 You can play differently as 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.960
 take a few lines so go 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.850
 all vikings on one line about the game 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.490
 all the Vikings on the same line you will 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.810
 to chuck very much after taking 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.800
 abilities at the fourth level you want 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.270
 know how to live spin 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.980
 push and trimming clips will 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.720
 be done much faster 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.790
 and we can take it alone 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.830
 siege camps I mainly play with everyone 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.320
 Vikings at the same time team battles 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.060
 they also show themselves well for 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.440
 ability damage score 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.500
 you want to live know how to spin 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.180
 Auto and ulti I really liked 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.710
 play for vikings is unique 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.140
 gameplay which I advise you
