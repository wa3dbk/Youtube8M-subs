some parchment paper so that nothing

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
some parchment paper so that nothing
sticks<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.520> great<00:02:22.730> thing<00:02:22.970> about<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.330> recipe

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
sticks the great thing about this recipe

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.720 
sticks the great thing about this recipe
is<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.440> essentially<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.490> your

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
is that this essentially is your

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.190 
is that this essentially is your
measuring<00:02:26.090> cup<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.050> vanilla

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
measuring cup this is just a vanilla

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.130 
measuring cup this is just a vanilla
yogurt<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> six<00:02:28.280> ounce<00:02:28.490> 170<00:02:29.450> gram<00:02:29.660> container

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
yogurt is a six ounce 170 gram container

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.190 
yogurt is a six ounce 170 gram container
and<00:02:30.520> there's<00:02:31.520> no<00:02:31.820> other<00:02:32.120> measuring<00:02:32.660> cup<00:02:32.990> other

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
and there's no other measuring cup other

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.580 
and there's no other measuring cup other
than<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.520> one<00:02:34.820> part<00:02:35.150> yogurt<00:02:35.990> which

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
we're going to put right in here and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.720 
we're going to put right in here and
this<00:02:39.140> pretty<00:02:39.650> much<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:40.010> all<00:02:40.190> go<00:02:40.430> into<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
this pretty much can all go into the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.410 
this pretty much can all go into the
same<00:02:40.970> Bowl<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.170> simple<00:02:43.180> let's<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.330> it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
same Bowl it's that simple let's get it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.260 
same Bowl it's that simple let's get it
all<00:02:44.540> out<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.870> there<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> will<00:02:45.830> say<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.310> my

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
all out of there now I will say this my

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.420 
all out of there now I will say this my
mom<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.810> remember<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> child<00:02:48.860> she<00:02:48.980> used

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
mom I remember this as a child she used

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.540 
mom I remember this as a child she used
to<00:02:49.519> use<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.760> banana<00:02:50.060> yogurt<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.019> tried<00:02:51.650> both<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
to use a banana yogurt I tried both the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.820 
to use a banana yogurt I tried both the
recipe<00:02:52.910> calls<00:02:53.090> for<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.300> banana<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:54.050> don't<00:02:54.680> think

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
recipe calls for a banana I don't think

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.890 
recipe calls for a banana I don't think
it<00:02:54.950> makes<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.190> difference<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:55.910> I'm<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.750> using

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
it makes a difference so I'm just using

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.720 
it makes a difference so I'm just using
vanilla<00:02:57.230> because<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.680> always<00:02:57.920> have<00:02:58.400> vanilla

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
vanilla because I always have vanilla

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.310 
vanilla because I always have vanilla
yogurt<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.239> hand<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.660> just<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.290> it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
yogurt on hand so I just really like it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.790 
yogurt on hand so I just really like it
so<00:03:00.709> you've<00:03:01.430> got<00:03:01.610> one<00:03:01.910> part<00:03:02.180> yogurt<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:03.410> part

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
so you've got one part yogurt one part

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.220 
so you've got one part yogurt one part
vegetable<00:03:04.730> oil<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.630> there's<00:03:05.780> no<00:03:05.930> butter<00:03:06.170> in
