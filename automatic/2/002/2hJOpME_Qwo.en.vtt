00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
the Julie do line for so long so I'm

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.590 
the Julie do line for so long so I'm
actually<00:02:39.610> wearing<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.240> my<00:02:40.390> toe<00:02:40.450> nails

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
actually wearing this on my toe nails

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.210 
actually wearing this on my toe nails
right<00:02:40.990> now<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.620> such<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> pretty

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
right now I think it's such a pretty

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.400 
right now I think it's such a pretty
pink<00:02:42.520> color<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.660> was<00:02:43.810> between<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
pink color and I was between this and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.050 
pink color and I was between this and
bikini<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.100> thought<00:02:45.340> about<00:02:45.520> getting<00:02:45.760> them<00:02:45.880> both

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
bikini I thought about getting them both

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.760 
bikini I thought about getting them both
but<00:02:46.330> they<00:02:46.450> were<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.780> similar<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.440> couldn't

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
but they were so similar that I couldn't

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.320 
but they were so similar that I couldn't
really<00:02:47.860> justify<00:02:48.460> it<00:02:48.520> especially<00:02:49.030> because<00:02:49.150> I

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
really justify it especially because I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.270 
really justify it especially because I
can't<00:02:49.660> wear<00:02:49.780> nail<00:02:49.900> polish<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.260> often<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
can't wear nail polish that often so I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.770 
can't wear nail polish that often so I
went<00:02:51.460> ahead<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.480> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
went ahead and got this one and I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.970 
went ahead and got this one and I
definitely<00:02:53.080> think<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.470> will<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.860> going

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
definitely think that I will be going

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.220 
definitely think that I will be going
back<00:02:54.130> for<00:02:54.490> more<00:02:54.700> next<00:02:55.450> time<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> may<00:02:55.960> be<00:02:56.020> in

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
back for more next time that I may be in

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.720

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
mist from victoria secret this is just a

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.300 
mist from victoria secret this is just a
little<00:04:53.940> mini<00:04:54.180> travel<00:04:54.690> one<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.080> this<00:04:55.979> was

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
little mini travel one and this was

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.310 
little mini travel one and this was
originally<00:04:56.729> eight<00:04:57.150> dollars<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.750> then<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:58.200> was

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
originally eight dollars and then it was

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.260 
originally eight dollars and then it was
like<00:04:58.350> half<00:04:58.680> off<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.040> i<00:04:59.100> gotta<00:04:59.280> stir<00:04:59.460> for<00:04:59.729> which

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
like half off so i gotta stir for which

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.730 
like half off so i gotta stir for which
i<00:05:00.389> think<00:05:00.450> eight<00:05:00.720> dollars<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.200> kind<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.590> lot

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
i think eight dollars is kind of a lot

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.890 
i think eight dollars is kind of a lot
to<00:05:01.919> pay<00:05:02.040> for<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.280> little<00:05:02.430> baby<00:05:02.700> missed<00:05:03.120> but<00:05:03.870> i
