00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 I'm gonna kick you out for a long time now 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.089
 it will also play that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.370
 that kick out a bit, too 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.730
 that you are really out of the half distance 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.730
 first play 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:28.950
 14 body just when I have this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.659
 Pick out and then accelerate 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.819
 you have to bring the body down with it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.740
 then she can not work up there 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.770
 Although the strike approach but then it works 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770
 downhill 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.079
 So personally surprised me 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.850
 you made it very well because it was fast 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.630
 Balls are the way out 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.280
 accelerate 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.810
 maybe it was through the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.489
 or maybe you have one else there 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.790
 strength or has a bit too 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790
 surprised 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.900
 my favorite joints are best 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.090
 but the super used the body 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.859
 Proposal approach always automatically 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.440
 chosen and was not going to pull now 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.790
 and has even difficult balance and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.739
 then by the fact that the body 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.299
 important introduced and also the ball 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.160
 you have not got up 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.230
 Just wait here to shoot the ball 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.269
 but you are always with that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.010
 also meet impact that could 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.050
 you can see quite well if he ends up then 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.120
 really close to the table 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.990
 and in the beginning that would be really 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.030
 that we came to the front and that too 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.020
 That's why it has only been very useful 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.020
 nice hit boats
