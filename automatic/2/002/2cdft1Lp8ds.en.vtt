00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.130
 only thing they have to do is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.969
 and this thing that says here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.820
 Y 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.100
 and you're going to let you register for 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.940
 those that are not registered well 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.940
 what are we going to see 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.460
 if he asks for a password or something 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.130
 ok they only give you that and one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.710
 register good when this is active 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.010
 good good here appears a doll like 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.690
 can see when a style appears 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.420
 well guys we have already loaded my account 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.450
 and as you can see there a sting came out 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.740
 a stip skin and how can you see this 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.710
 It's the game 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.890
 here the only thing they have to do is the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.250
 server will choose you 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.600
 if you are a hunter or you are a block or if 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.400
 you are a block the only thing that has to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.410
 do hide in a very good way 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 until the game is over so 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.060
 win they made a hunter because you have 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 have to look for all the blocks to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.640
 finish the game as fast 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.840
 possible a subscribed friends that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 write like this 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.980
 ready thank you the one who told me that I know what 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 I thank you enormously and I send you a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.320
 greeting I do not remember his name but 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 okay, let's hope that 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.540
 start the game if I show you that 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.320
 It's my turn not and how sometimes it's your turn 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.150
 weather 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.150
 the first is that look is to play a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.610
 single game I put a block of a 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.180
 watermelon 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.190
 and then when they kill you then you become 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.830
 a hunter and you have to look for the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.080
 others and when you're watermelon too 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.820
 you can attack the hunters since you 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.600
 they give a sword the only disadvantage that 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.260
 the hunters have in their 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.930
 his iron armor and sword of 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.750
 diamond and you have a stone but 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.210
 that's all it's worth we'll hope that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.800
 start if you start 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.150
 good for those who have not understood me 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.319
 if they are going to register only you 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.890
 they have to give the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.690
 and place your password and you're not 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.770
 need to place more nothing only 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.770
 a little 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.140
 to see when here now begins this 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.310
 and this 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.720
 where 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.040
 fuck 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.760
 he got watts 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.420
 and this is worth as you can see to me I put 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.720
 a block I am a block of this from 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.300
 pumpkin 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.460
 so let's see let's see where 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.560
 we can do, I think you have to 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.950
 make yourself a more strategic part by 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.950
 example there 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.540
 and you stay there still and that and up 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.490
 until the heel until you 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.259
 encounter ends the game good as 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.060
 can see is not stone and the 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.490
 hunters have a diamond kind 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.400
