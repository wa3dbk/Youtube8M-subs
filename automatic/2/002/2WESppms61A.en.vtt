00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.360
 Naval official school 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.680
 Hey, my captains, everyone! 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.070
 In the previous series 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.390
 We mentioned combat ships and cruisers. 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 Today, let’s talk about the aircraft carrier. 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 The emergence of this type of ship has greatly changed the naval battle pattern. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.330
 The first aircraft carrier is just an extension of the reconnaissance base. 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 At the time, aviation technology was still very primitive. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 The carrier aircraft is also not divided into different types. 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.780
 Therefore, these ships have limited attack capabilities. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 However, progress is inevitable 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.770
 Early multi-wings were quickly replaced by highly reliable and well-controlled biplanes 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.910
 Later evolved into a portable 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.760
 Heavy-duty torpedo and bomb monoplane 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.180
 at the same time 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.870
 The carrier-based fighter also became a model for hunting enemy attack aircraft. 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.890
 The United States and Japan are the first countries to recognize the importance of naval air power 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.690
 Also the UK is 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.080
 These countries operated the most during World War II. 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 And the most advanced aircraft carrier fleet 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 US and Japanese aircraft carriers are different 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.320
 The main difference is in mobility and secondary arming 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.850
 In any case, the biggest difference in the game is the performance of the aircraft. 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.700
 And flight team 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.980
 Each aircraft carrier has several squadrons 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.230
 Enough for multiple tasks 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.080
 For most aircraft carriers, torpedo attack aircraft serve as the main anti-ship mission 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.850
 Their torpedoes can destroy thick skin slow targets 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 For example, an enemy battleship or an aircraft carrier 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 Dive bombers are more effective for light armored vessels or destroyers 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.180
 The HE bomb they dropped can cause a lot of damage and cause a fire. 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.370
 At the same time, carrier-based fighters can gain air superiority 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 Their ability to deal with aircraft is more effective than ship anti-aircraft guns. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.370
 In addition, all squadrons can be used for investigation 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.990
 You can adjust the composition of your aviation team on board. 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.800
 For example, emphasizing one of the abilities 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 You can use this to adjust the battle mode of the aircraft carrier and establish your role in the team. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.230
 All in all, the ability to diversify 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.410
 Make the aircraft carrier's play way very special 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.950
 The first US aircraft carrier was USS Langley: a coal ship transformation aircraft carrier 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.520
 She is the first of the US aircraft carrier spurs in Warship World. 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.540
 This ship can carry two squadrons 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.070
 Make her a good carrier novice ship 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.730
 Langley's only two squadrons 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.730
 Make her a good aircraft management exercise boat 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.120
 All aircraft carriers behind her technology tree have better armor 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.570
 Faster speed, better secondary arming and air defense system 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.950
 But most importantly, there are more flying squadrons. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.750
 The plane flies faster and more durable 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.780
 Armed, torpedo and bomb power have made great progress. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.650
 Tiers V, VI, and VII, players will get a light escort aircraft carrier Bogue 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.820
 Independence, and Ranger. 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.330
 Using these ships will make you more familiar with game tactics. 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.770
 Each ship carries three types of aircraft, giving players a more diverse choice. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.790
 Tiers VIII and IX for heavy aircraft carriers Lexington and Essex. 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.770
 Compared with their predecessors, these two ships have more abundant armor protection. 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.570
 More powerful secondary armaments, of course, better aircraft 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.420
 At the top of the US technology tree you will find the aircraft carrier Midway 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.390
 She was the largest aircraft carrier at the time. 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.390
 Even carrying a jet fighter 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.330
 American fighters are worth mentioning 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680
 Each squadron has more planes 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.160
 US aircraft carrier is very good at snatching air superiority 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.950
 Usually you can beat your opponent's bag. 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.690
 Despite this, the Japanese aircraft carrier still has some weapons that can be countered. 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.770
 The characteristics of the Japanese aircraft carrier make the player more aggressive 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.840
 The Japanese air force is relatively small, but the number of squadrons is relatively large. 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.070
 The power of these aircraft carriers is reflected in the aviation torpedoes. 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.310
 Few ships can survive the attacks of several squadrons. 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.580
 Japanese aircraft carrier branch line from Hōshō (literally meaning "flying phoenix") 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.490
 Unlike American rivals, Hōshō was built in the name of the aircraft carrier. 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.250
 This makes her better than Langley in all aspects. 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.850
 However, her smaller hangar size allows you to make no mistakes 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.210
 Every loss is very serious for you. 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.380
 The next aircraft carrier Zuihō ("Ruifeng") 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.180
 It was transformed from the watership mothership. 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.800
 She is bigger and faster than her predecessor, Zuihō can carry more planes 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.000
 And provide more tactical options 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.320
 Tiers VI and VII, Ryūjō ("Dragonfly") 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.080
 With Sōryū ("Canglong"), the legendary "Dragon" word 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.420
 Representing the strong attack and protection of their aviation team 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.880
 As a result, players can use a variety of tactics. 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.980
 From investigative missions to anti-ship attacks 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.480
 Shōkaku and Taihō ("Shanhe" and "Dafeng") 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.750
 For Tiers VIII and IX aircraft carriers 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.350
 Less restrictions on international treaties 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.480
 They really show the majesty of the Great Japanese Imperial Navy. 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.700
 With heavy armor, high speed and a large number of flying squadrons 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.120
 These ships are on par with the same level of enemy ships in all kinds of performance. 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.770
 Heavy aircraft carrier Hakuryu ("White Dragon") is the apex of the Japanese aircraft carrier spur 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.400
 This is a planned warship that was not actually built. 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.630
 The large number of flying squadrons will make the enemy nervous: 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.730
 This aircraft carrier can operate eight squadrons at the same time. 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.260
 Therefore, it is not easy to avoid her attack. 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.570
 In the next episode, we will discuss how to be an expert in dodging enemy attacks. 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.270
 Ready to review "World of Warships" 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.960
 The most reckless and fierce warrior – the destroyer 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.560
 Everyone
