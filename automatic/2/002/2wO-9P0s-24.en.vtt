treat the water first the treated water
will<00:00:43.640> then<00:00:43.670> undergo<00:00:44.180> some<00:00:44.629> processes<00:00:45.260> such<00:00:46.129> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
will then undergo some processes such as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.090 
will then undergo some processes such as
microfiltration<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.329> ultrafiltration<00:00:48.100> you

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
microfiltration and ultrafiltration you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.729 
microfiltration and ultrafiltration you
will<00:00:49.219> also<00:00:49.460> undergo<00:00:49.789> reverse<00:00:50.269> osmosis<00:00:50.739> to

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
will also undergo reverse osmosis to

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.250 
will also undergo reverse osmosis to
filter<00:00:52.129> out<00:00:52.339> inorganic<00:00:53.269> substances<00:00:53.870> such<00:00:54.230> as

metals nitrates and chloride

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.069 
metals nitrates and chloride
finally<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:58.879> will<00:00:58.999> undergo<00:00:59.329> ultraviolet

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
finally you will undergo ultraviolet

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.479 
finally you will undergo ultraviolet
disinfection<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.879> remove<00:01:02.089> all<00:01:02.329> substances

disinfection to remove all substances

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
disinfection to remove all substances
then<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.850> water<00:01:05.030> will<00:01:05.239> be<00:01:05.360> safe
