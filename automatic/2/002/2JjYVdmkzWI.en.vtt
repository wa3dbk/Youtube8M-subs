00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
people are really futuristic they really

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160 
people are really futuristic they really
could<00:01:34.470> give<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:35.130> less<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
could give a less about the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
could give a less about the
established<00:01:37.770> norms<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.150> society<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:40.290> is

established norms in society which is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
established norms in society which is
great<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.420> norms

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
great because I think that those norms

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
great because I think that those norms
are<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.200> crumbling<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.520> time

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
are really crumbling down at this time

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
are really crumbling down at this time
in<00:01:45.060> history<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.200> Pluto<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
