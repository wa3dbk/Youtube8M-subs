that<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:26.159> could<00:01:26.340> swing<00:01:26.670> his<00:01:26.820> his<00:01:27.479> arm<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that he could swing his his arm for the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
that he could swing his his arm for the
lightsaber<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:28.950> right<00:01:29.159> arm<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.090> very

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
figure out hey would mic that was from

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.880 
figure out hey would mic that was from
you<00:02:48.120> know<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.720> version<00:02:48.960> or<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you know this version or but this is a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.000 
you know this version or but this is a
2005<00:02:50.460> figure<00:02:50.760> probably<00:02:51.000> evolutions

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
2005 figure probably evolutions

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.290 
2005 figure probably evolutions
evolutions<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.490> we<00:02:53.850> were<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> three

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
evolutions it's the I we were the three

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300 
evolutions it's the I we were the three
different<00:02:54.480> figures<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.890> could<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.070> there

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
different figures so it could be there

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
different figures so it could be there
to<00:02:56.400> sip<00:02:56.580> evolutions<00:02:57.030> pack<00:02:57.240> but<00:02:58.080> again<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> could

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
to sip evolutions pack but again I could

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
to sip evolutions pack but again I could
be<00:02:58.590> wrong<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:59.100> feel<00:02:59.250> free<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.430> collect<00:02:59.640> correct

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
be wrong so feel free to collect correct

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.120 
be wrong so feel free to collect correct
