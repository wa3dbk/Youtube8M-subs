sense<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.550> like<00:05:51.940> this<00:05:52.060> one<00:05:52.120> they<00:05:52.330> sort<00:05:52.600> of

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
sense I like this one they sort of

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.930 
sense I like this one they sort of
really<00:05:53.650> get<00:05:53.980> in<00:05:54.100> touch<00:05:54.280> with<00:05:54.490> what<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:54.760> class

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
really get in touch with what the class

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.120 
really get in touch with what the class
should<00:05:55.389> be<00:05:55.540> about<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.020> sort<00:05:56.230> of<00:05:56.260> structure

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130

the<00:05:57.220> gameplay<00:05:57.520> around<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.790> kind<00:05:57.940> of<00:05:57.970> arms

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
the gameplay around it kind of arms

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.700 
the gameplay around it kind of arms
versus<00:05:58.480> fury<00:05:58.690> is<00:05:58.780> a<00:05:58.810> good<00:05:58.930> example<00:05:59.020> about<00:05:59.440> arms

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
versus fury is a good example about arms

dealing<00:06:03.970> playstyle<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.389> that<00:06:04.570> makes<00:06:04.750> sense

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
dealing playstyle and that makes sense

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.659
