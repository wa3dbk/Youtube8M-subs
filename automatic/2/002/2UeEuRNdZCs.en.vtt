00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
but honestly it's not perfect if you get

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
but honestly it's not perfect if you get
too<00:02:35.489> cocky<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.969> try<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.180> rapidly<00:02:36.540> tap<00:02:36.780> the

too cocky and try and rapidly tap the
screen<00:02:37.019> too<00:02:37.290> fast<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.799> might<00:02:37.920> confuse<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
screen too fast you might confuse the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.890 
screen too fast you might confuse the
game<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.849> thinking<00:02:39.150> they're<00:02:39.299> slashes<00:02:39.719> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
game into thinking they're slashes and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.679 
game into thinking they're slashes and
like<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.650> said<00:02:40.709> earlier<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:42.090> game<00:02:42.299> focuses

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
like I said earlier the game focuses

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.420 
like I said earlier the game focuses
more<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.230> attacking<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> early<00:02:44.250> chapters

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
more on attacking in the early chapters

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.569 
more on attacking in the early chapters
so<00:02:45.560> early<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.680> game<00:02:46.950> feels<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
so early in the game feels like the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.039 
so early in the game feels like the
games<00:02:47.730> running<00:02:47.939> on<00:02:48.120> autopilot<00:02:48.359> since<00:02:48.900> all

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
games running on autopilot since all

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.420 
games running on autopilot since all
you're<00:02:49.200> really<00:02:49.230> doing<00:02:49.439> is<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.799> stroking<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
you're really doing is just stroking and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.339 
you're really doing is just stroking and
tapping<00:02:50.819> without<00:02:51.390> any<00:02:51.569> blocking<00:02:51.959> whatsoever

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349

tapping without any blocking whatsoever
my<00:02:53.189> biggest<00:02:53.519> complaint<00:02:54.030> comes<00:02:54.209> from<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
my biggest complaint comes from the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
my biggest complaint comes from the
elements<00:02:55.019> outside<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> combat<00:02:56.099> platform

elements outside of the combat platform
elements<00:02:57.480> are<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.659> huge<00:02:58.590> rarity<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.280> when<00:02:59.400> they

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
elements are a huge rarity and when they

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.879 
elements are a huge rarity and when they
do<00:02:59.579> appear<00:02:59.819> they're<00:03:00.689> very<00:03:00.900> wonky<00:03:01.170> you'll

into<00:03:45.510> wondering<00:03:45.840> what<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.169> game<00:03:46.349> might<00:03:46.500> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
into wondering what the game might have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.629 
into wondering what the game might have
looked<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.829> if<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.159> designers<00:03:47.430> went

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
looked like if the designers went

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.729 
looked like if the designers went
entirely<00:03:48.120> 3d<00:03:48.659> instead<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.199> resin<00:03:49.470> evil

entirely 3d instead of the resin evil
cheap<00:03:49.919> maybe<00:03:50.639> we'll<00:03:50.819> see<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.180> when<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.449> team

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
cheap maybe we'll see that when the team

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.539 
cheap maybe we'll see that when the team
