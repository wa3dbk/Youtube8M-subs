put<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> sidebar<00:00:44.430> everything<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> use<00:00:45.239> what

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
put in the sidebar everything I use what

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.510 
put in the sidebar everything I use what
I<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.370> eyes

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
I like about this look is that the eyes

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.270 
I like about this look is that the eyes
are<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.390> dramatic<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
are really really dramatic and then it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
are really really dramatic and then it
just<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> draws<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.149> attention<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
just kind of draws your attention to the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.000 
just kind of draws your attention to the
eyes<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.170> everything<00:00:52.530> else<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> very

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
eyes because everything else is very

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
eyes because everything else is very
neutral<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.600> cool

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
neutral and I think that's really cool

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
neutral and I think that's really cool
um<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.699> really

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
um I don't know if this is really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340 
um I don't know if this is really
something<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> could<00:00:57.510> wear<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.719> during<00:00:58.199> like

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
something you could wear out during like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
something you could wear out during like
the<00:00:58.379> day<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> normal<00:00:59.699> day<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.149> two

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the day just on a normal day or two

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.400 
the day just on a normal day or two
school<00:01:00.510> whatever<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> definitely

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
school whatever but it's definitely

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.020 
school whatever but it's definitely
something<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> could<00:01:02.190> wear<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> party

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
something you could wear to like a party

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.679 
something you could wear to like a party
or<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.559> fancy<00:01:05.070> night<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.360> still

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
or a more like fancy night out I still

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.850 
or a more like fancy night out I still
think<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.110> cool<00:01:07.229> though<00:01:07.500> even<00:01:07.710> if

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
think it's really cool though even if

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
think it's really cool though even if
you<00:01:07.979> can't<00:01:08.159> wear<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:08.729> makes<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you can't wear it all the time makes it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
you can't wear it all the time makes it
a<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> special<00:01:10.950> occasion

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a little bit like for a special occasion

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.789 
a little bit like for a special occasion
or<00:01:11.340> whatever<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.530> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
or whatever but it's really I think it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
or whatever but it's really I think it's
cool<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.310> draws<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> attention<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.240> your

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
