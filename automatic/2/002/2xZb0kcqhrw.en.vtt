geothermal heating and cooling so with

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.200 
geothermal heating and cooling so with
the<00:01:51.440> resource<00:01:51.800> like<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.250> hot<00:01:52.400> springs<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:53.030> was

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
really a very natural decision and I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.820 
really a very natural decision and I

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
think that relates to stewardship of the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.960 
think that relates to stewardship of the
place<00:02:01.700> itself<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.740> legacy<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.820> we've
