number one variants we also have a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.449 
number one variants we also have a
Batman<00:02:30.430> print<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:32.109> looks<00:02:32.349> cool<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.890> no

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
Batman print that looks cool actually no

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.890 
Batman print that looks cool actually no
there's<00:02:33.700> no<00:02:33.790> branding<00:02:34.299> on<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:34.689> it's<00:02:34.840> not

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
there's no branding on it so it's not

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.599 
there's no branding on it so it's not
advertising<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.709> doesn't<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.069> comic<00:02:36.400> block

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
advertising it doesn't have comic block

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.479 
advertising it doesn't have comic block
branding<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.209> doesn't<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:38.129> DC<00:02:39.129> Comics

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
branding it doesn't have DC Comics

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.129 
branding it doesn't have DC Comics
branding<00:02:39.970> does<00:02:40.359> not<00:02:40.510> even<00:02:40.659> anything<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.049> the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
branding does not even anything on the

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.360 
branding does not even anything on the
back<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> guess<00:02:41.769> that's<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.219> nice

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
back so I guess that's just a nice

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.819 
back so I guess that's just a nice
little<00:02:42.400> bonus<00:02:42.819> for<00:02:43.209> Batman<00:02:43.930> fans<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.560> people

that collect art fun Batman prints and a
couple<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.609> cards<00:02:49.079> if<00:02:50.079> I<00:02:50.470> could<00:02:50.650> have<00:02:50.799> any

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
seems to be the most practical but

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.920 
seems to be the most practical but
invisibility<00:02:57.819> would<00:02:58.180> allow<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.720> have<00:02:58.810> the
