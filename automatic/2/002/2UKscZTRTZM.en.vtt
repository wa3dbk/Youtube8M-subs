00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.090
 with that, the counter stands for tens of possibly hundreds of feyenoord supporters 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 the one with the end of Wednesday that I saw so going out of control 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.939
 she shares several 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.919
 There is a reason for concern if we have one 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.269
 many feyenoord supporters about whining 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.749
 I understand very well again in the supporters who are also just one of one 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.470
 want to enjoy a nice competition to travel to Amsterdam 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.050
 and then end up in the wrong boxes, that would be a lot of trouble 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.949
 come and care the crime with a feyenoord I also put in my colleague 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.640
 I also did Amsterdam with the police forces in Amsterdam and in 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 rotterdam and that's why my advice is not her 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.760
 we let the catfish to those feyenoord supporters and ruin it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.590
 not 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.130
 well I am not too keen on taking risks for yourself and me 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.830
 am still for the weekend because I hear stories from people who 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.240
 maybe with kids they would then travel less 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.620
 and you run the risk that you did shares because the because 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 Amsterdam police with support from Rotterdam colleagues 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.580
 was prepared to stop rotterdammers that will be a 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.140
 disappointment is that calf street is delivering 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 and if you did slip through the control and still walk inside 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.740
 You run the risk that you end up with the wrong course and wrong gestures 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.159
 wrong people applaud in bruges at a wrong time and on you 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.290
 risk comes across better insight and that is not worth staying at home 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 watch on TV yes I am not often moralizing but in this case I say 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 please do not go to feyenoord then watch tv 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.730
 with what we now know, so dozens or hundreds of supporters 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.220
 going with that one anyway 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.680
 Joel colleague deeldellaan would like to recommend the entire game perhaps 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.120
 not to go ahead next Wednesday anp colleagues there is man enough to 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.490
 even its own public policy turns out to be the public policy 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.310
 talk neighborhood 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.760
 not together certainly not four cameras and microphones as I have my colleagues 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.980
 to report then I call him would come 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 that itself does not have to secretly hide a spot somewhere hidden 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.829
 skybox 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.430
 as my supporters from rotterdam but no longer for fellow human beings 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.770
 admitted to the arena the rotterdam mayor stays at home 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.189
 watch TV
