00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
instead of my empty room I think it'll

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.969 
instead of my empty room I think it'll
look<00:01:28.619> more<00:01:29.009> professional<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.979> yeah

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
look more professional that way and yeah

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.660 
look more professional that way and yeah
so<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.439> reason<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.890> got<00:01:35.369> rid<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> the

happens<00:02:02.020> like<00:02:02.500> when<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.340> expect<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.820> enemy

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
happens like when you expect the enemy

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.660 
happens like when you expect the enemy
to<00:02:04.210> notice<00:02:04.690> somebody<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.590> go<00:02:06.460> for

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
to notice somebody and not and go for

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.070 
to notice somebody and not and go for
them<00:02:06.820> instead<00:02:07.150> because<00:02:07.420> they<00:02:07.450> pose<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> major

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
them instead because they pose a major

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:19.070 
them instead because they pose a major
threat<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.500> them<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> do<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.520> don't<00:02:17.400> okay

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
threat to them and you do you don't okay

threat to them and you do you don't okay
all<00:02:20.080> right<00:02:20.170> guess<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.410> didn't<00:02:20.740> explain<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
all right guess I didn't explain that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.660 
all right guess I didn't explain that
very<00:02:21.340> well<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.610> mean<00:02:21.790> sometimes<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.780> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
very well I mean sometimes like I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.949 
very well I mean sometimes like I
predict<00:02:24.670> my<00:02:24.850> enemy<00:02:25.209> will<00:02:25.360> notice<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> guy

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
predict my enemy will notice the guy

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.600 
predict my enemy will notice the guy
that<00:02:26.200> poses<00:02:26.410> an<00:02:26.709> immediate<00:02:26.830> threat<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.370> him

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
that poses an immediate threat to him

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.320 
that poses an immediate threat to him
but<00:02:28.510> instead<00:02:28.630> he<00:02:29.620> goes<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.070> me<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:33.040> just
