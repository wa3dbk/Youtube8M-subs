00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.300 
I'm looking at the alignments right now
to<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.269> sure<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.810> straight<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:19.010> looked<00:02:19.250> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
to make sure it's straight it looked to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.440 
to make sure it's straight it looked to
me<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.519> quite<00:02:19.760> straight<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.330> is

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
me as quite straight and there it is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.710 
me as quite straight and there it is
okay<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.349> looks<00:02:21.980> quite<00:02:22.220> good<00:02:22.480> next<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:23.629> is

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay so looks quite good next thing is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.710 
okay so looks quite good next thing is
of<00:02:23.750> course<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:25.040> add<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> solar<00:02:25.640> lights<00:02:25.879> but

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
of course is to add the solar lights but

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.990 
of course is to add the solar lights but
what<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.050> end<00:02:27.349> up<00:02:27.470> doing<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.980> get<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.489> smart

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
what I end up doing is get this smart

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.890 
what I end up doing is get this smart
energy<00:02:29.989> solar<00:02:30.349> light<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:31.000> 100<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.690> light

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
energy solar light it's a 100 so light

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.699 
energy solar light it's a 100 so light
LED<00:02:33.500> light<00:02:34.120> has<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.180> power<00:02:35.450> by<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:36.050> course<00:02:36.110> solar

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
LED light has a power by of course solar

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.680 
LED light has a power by of course solar
panel<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> very<00:02:37.610> tiny<00:02:37.879> one<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.540> probably

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
panel a very tiny one it's probably

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.199 
panel a very tiny one it's probably
about<00:02:39.019> 1<00:02:39.620> or<00:02:39.650> 2<00:02:39.769> watt<00:02:40.069> panel<00:02:40.730> there's<00:02:40.940> two<00:02:41.090> of

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
about 1 or 2 watt panel there's two of

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.460 
about 1 or 2 watt panel there's two of
them<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.470> think<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.610> had<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:44.300> set<00:02:44.629> those<00:02:44.870> 200

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
them so I think I had to set those 200

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.970 
them so I think I had to set those 200
LED<00:02:46.459> lights<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.000> got<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.690> sale<00:02:47.989> last<00:02:48.470> Christmas

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
LED lights I got on sale last Christmas

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.130 
LED lights I got on sale last Christmas
for<00:02:49.190> around<00:02:49.340> 5<00:02:49.760> bucks<00:02:50.090> well<00:02:50.330> 10<00:02:50.510> bucks<00:02:50.720> each

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
something like that and then I test it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.480 
something like that and then I test it
out<00:02:56.930> first<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.320> make<00:02:57.410> sure<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.740> works<00:02:57.950> right<00:02:58.100> so

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
out first to make sure it works right so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.690 
out first to make sure it works right so
here<00:02:59.090> we<00:02:59.120> go<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.980> ensure<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.250> light<00:03:01.520> is

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
here we go I ensure that the light is

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.460 
here we go I ensure that the light is
actually<00:03:01.730> working<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.360> both<00:03:02.510> sides<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.350> I'm

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
actually working in both sides so I'm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.370 
actually working in both sides so I'm
looking<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:04.070> there's<00:03:04.700> light<00:03:04.910> there<00:03:05.210> yeah<00:03:05.600> okay

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
looking at there's light there yeah okay

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.770 
looking at there's light there yeah okay
it's<00:03:06.560> working<00:03:06.740> and<00:03:07.190> then<00:03:07.910> I'm<00:03:08.150> testing<00:03:08.510> also

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
it's working and then I'm testing also

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.820 
it's working and then I'm testing also
on<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.440> other<00:03:09.820> solar<00:03:11.050> light<00:03:12.050> as<00:03:12.200> well<00:03:12.380> so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
on the other solar light as well so

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.250 
on the other solar light as well so
there's<00:03:13.130> 200<00:03:13.550> LED<00:03:14.090> light<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.420> there<00:03:14.630> it's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
there's 200 LED light in there it's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.160 
there's 200 LED light in there it's
everything<00:03:15.770> seems<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.190> work<00:03:16.700> fine<00:03:17.140> right<00:03:18.140> I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
the lamp post there we go

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.610 
the lamp post there we go
try<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.280> my<00:03:31.490> best<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.940> get<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.360> there<00:03:32.620> 200

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
try to do my best to get it in there 200

try to do my best to get it in there 200
LED<00:03:34.070> lights<00:03:34.310> okay<00:03:34.960> now<00:03:35.960> this<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.740> this<00:03:37.070> is

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
LED lights okay now this is this is

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.910 
LED lights okay now this is this is
gonna<00:03:37.730> be<00:03:37.880> awesome<00:03:38.030> for<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> summer<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.740> even

know enjoy the night there we go I'm
trying<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.370> align<00:03:58.670> them<00:03:58.970> make<00:03:59.900> sure<00:04:00.110> all<00:04:00.380> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
trying to align them make sure all the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.400 
trying to align them make sure all the
wires<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.190> okay<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.030> notice<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
wires in there okay you notice the the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.070 
wires in there okay you notice the the
solar<00:04:03.680> light<00:04:03.950> panel<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.430> actually<00:04:04.780> glued<00:04:05.780> hot

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
solar light panel is actually glued hot

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.910 
solar light panel is actually glued hot
glue<00:04:06.320> on<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.650> top<00:04:07.040> see<00:04:07.670> one<00:04:08.630> facing<00:04:09.110> east<00:04:09.560> and

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
glue on the top see one facing east and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.310 
glue on the top see one facing east and
ones<00:04:10.040> facing<00:04:10.310> west<00:04:10.790> or<00:04:11.300> north<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.960> south<00:04:12.200> it

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
ones facing west or north to south it

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.200 
ones facing west or north to south it
doesn't<00:04:12.680> matter<00:04:12.800> but<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.190> mean<00:04:13.580> will<00:04:13.700> opposite

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
doesn't matter but I mean will opposite
