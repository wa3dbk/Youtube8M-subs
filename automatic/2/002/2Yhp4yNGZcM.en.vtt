orientations<00:02:24.510> by<00:02:24.959> simply<00:02:25.260> finding<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.799> angle

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
orientations by simply finding the angle

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.670 
orientations by simply finding the angle
that<00:02:26.219> works<00:02:26.459> best<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.969> adjusting<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.989> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that works best and adjusting it so you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.559 
that works best and adjusting it so you
cannot<00:02:29.069> however<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.819> find<00:02:30.060> any<00:02:30.239> kind<00:02:30.480> of

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
cannot however really find any kind of

cannot however really find any kind of
typing<00:02:30.989> angle<00:02:31.250> really<00:02:32.250> about<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
typing angle really about that is the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.449 
typing angle really about that is the
only<00:02:33.269> typing<00:02:33.840> angle<00:02:33.989> there<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.439> it's<00:02:35.220> kind<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
only typing angle there is it's kind of

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.429 
only typing angle there is it's kind of
missing<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:35.970> opposite<00:02:36.510> flip<00:02:36.780> around<00:02:36.930> style

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
missing that opposite flip around style

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.770 
missing that opposite flip around style
but<00:02:37.799> I<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.250> find<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.879> sort<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.299> works<00:02:39.569> as

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
but I do find that this sort of works as

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750 
but I do find that this sort of works as
a<00:02:39.810> typing<00:02:40.260> angle<00:02:40.409> depending<00:02:41.129> on<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> surface
