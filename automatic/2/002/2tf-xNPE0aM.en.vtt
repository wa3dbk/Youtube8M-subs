00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 they are such friends who follow my videos 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.240
 we are in another video 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.430
 and everyone 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.160
 and 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.680
 reality 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 it's sad to walk 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.850
 and for everything 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 where to look 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 my life 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 d 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.500
 and me 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.310
 the world 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.310
 whoever 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.780
 yes 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.780
 the Lord 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.580
 yes 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.880
 the chords with a single major my 7 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 I bring about four we will occupy my 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 less 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.620
 the youngest of the 7 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.460
 recent 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.460
 greater 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 what we have seen primary and secondary 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.000
 it is quickly commented which are the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.330
 let's go when they have a chord 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.490
 for example a low first sun is going to be 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.630
 the sixth string and the second on the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.630
 fourth in that way 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.870
 for my seven brothers in the sixth and the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.870
 second the fifth 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.070
 and for the minor the fifth and sixth 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.400
 we also continue to occupy the fifth 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.849
 6th recent occupying a fourth and the 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.849
 fifth 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.480
 for the minor however make the sixth 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.480
 and the second in this way 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:20.700
 we do not occupy the fifth and the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.700
 lasexta we do this let's put down 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.900
 we stepped on this one of dollars exactly that 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.900
 fret and we go like this 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 you can put both fingers so you can 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:44.189
 leave you know brother in the fifth 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.170
 second with the sixth if they put them like this 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.510
 the ropes of that for the lamb 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.349
 we are touching of the fifth agreement 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.349
 rope is low 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.830
 and so you give me something similar with the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.239
 fifth and the second with the sixth and 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.239
 going up and down but 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.819
 if you want you can also transform 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.819
 remember 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.220
 and everyone 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.500
 but for the introduction we are going to take 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.960
 slowly let's start to enter 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.320
 you feel a third string in this 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.320
 shape 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.849
 one 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.740
 Y 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:04.250
 to play the part that follows from that 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:04.250
 Moment are cookies and frets 7 too 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.320
 let's play the third string while 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.810
 of 7 and also the first one in 7 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.810
 At the same time that way 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.990
 in this way last part of the 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.820
 production that is this area of this 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.630
 way let's see more slowly 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.389
 Clear 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.389
 the third the third in the second 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.740
 we end up in the air
