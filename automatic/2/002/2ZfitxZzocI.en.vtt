00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.440
 the cell of an airplane is composed of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.000
 four different parts the fuselage 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.950
 wings 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.790
 empennage 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.790
 and the landing gear 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.180
 the fuselage is used to carry the load 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.640
 useful to the aircraft so that's where that is 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.340
 placed the cockpit 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.950
 its structure made of frames and iss 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.750
 is covered by a coating of 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.190
 plywood or aluminum 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.190
 if she is not in you 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.700
 it ensures lift this phenomenon 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.790
 is due to the formation of an overpressure 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.420
 below and a depression above 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:03.760
 of the ale the overpressure represents 25% 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 of lift and depression 75% to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.229
 the front of the board attacks 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.850
 and at the back the trailing edge 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.840
 the killer amp and the part of the ale 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.540
 attached to the fuselage while the salmon 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.630
 corresponds to its end the top of 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.800
 the ale is called extrados and the underside 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.950
 intrade where each one is constituted 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.560
 of a langeron connected to the fuselage and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.300
 several ribs like the fuselage 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.080
 it can be covered with 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.030
 aluminum plywood or canvas and 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.759
 the wings can be mounted to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.509
 different heights so we find 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:50.200
 lower wings of the middle wings and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.960
 high wings an aircraft with a 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 only pair of them is a monoplane a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.390
 device possessing two lose it 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.180
 so will be called biplane the wings 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.760
 can adopt different profiles by 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.479
 convex symmetric by convex 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.200
 dissymmetry hollow convex plane 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.790
 or double curvature depending on the type 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.330
 aircraft to which they are 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.000
 for 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.849
 and they can have an elongation 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 low moderate or high wings to a 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.769
 low elongation confers a more 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 great maneuverability to the device and are 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.989
 better adapted to the supersonic flight 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.799
 wings at a high elongation are 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.349
 mainly ride on gliders 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.170
 the rope and the line connecting the center 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.019
 of curvature of the board attack and the edge 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.480
 of profile leakage so it varies in 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.269
 according to the type of it we find 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.109
 wing wings constant wings 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:58.220
 elliptical wings and nets and 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:01.280
 trapezoidal wings the angle of arrows 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.970
 corresponds to the angle formed by the ale and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.140
 the transverse axis of the fuselage 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.160
 we find wings right in arrow in 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:18.019
 inverted arrow with variable geometry and 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.419
 delta wings to be there and the angle 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.169
 formed by the plane of each wing and the 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.169
 horizontal plane 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:33.440
 it can be negative positive negative or 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.989
 compose there are also wings 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.989
 seagulls and less is reversed 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.870
 the empennage is a set of plans 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.900
 fixed and mobile which ensures stability 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.969
 of the aircraft around the pitch axes 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:04:00.260
 is lassay it can be classic 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:04:03.650
 cruciform haunt in v multi drift 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.650
 Bouby Beam 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.989
 the plane can be represented in the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:19.989
 reference trihedral formed by the x axis 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:23.260
 lax is there access lakes 6 corresponds 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.820
 at the longitudinal axis or roll axes 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:34.249
 lax y equals the transverse axis or 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.949
 pitch axes the z axis and the weary kz2 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:40.519
 the fins are placed at the end 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.129
 wings and commanded by the handle their 

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:45.439
 asymmetrical movement allow to 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:49.219
 change the inclination of the plane on the 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:52.609
 kz2 roll the rudder 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:57.199
 is on the horizontal plane 

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:59.929
 of the empennage on an aircraft endowed with a 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.929
 duck plane so it will be at 

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:04.519
 the front of the fuselage 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:06.799
 it is also controlled by the handle 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:11.179
 and allows to modify the base of 

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:13.489
 the device on the kz2 pitching the 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:16.459
 rudder is placed on the 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:20.949
 drift it is controlled by the rudder 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:23.719
 and allows to change the angle of these 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.809
 each of the control surfaces can be equipped 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.329
 of a compensator these small surfaces 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.099
 movers placed on their trailing edge 

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.789
 serve to keep them in a 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.559
 position ensuring the balanced of the plane 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.719
 the depth compensator allow 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:42.159
 also to cancel the felt effort 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.159
 in the neck during takeoff 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.149
 high lift devices 

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:51.789
 increase the lift of 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:55.339
 wings at low speeds 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:58.550
 we distinguish the shutters located on the 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:02.839
 trailing edge and the beaks placed on the 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.779
 leading edge the shutters is on 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.659
 the inner part of the ale between the 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:11.400
 fuselage and fins 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:14.850
 there are different types 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.100
 shutters date raft the shutters of 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:22.500
 curvature curvature shutters 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.720
 face the shutters of the type fohrer the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.150
 attacking beaks increases the 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.979
 camber and the surface of the ale and 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.580
 delays the detachment of air streams 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:37.039
 by slit effect they can be 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.039
 automatic fixed or order 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.800
 there are three types 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.380
 landing gear the very classic 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.710
 which is composed of a main train and 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.560
 of a roulette that the tricycle train 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:57.090
 which includes a main feature and a 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.180
 train before the single-spoke train that gets 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.460
 consists of an hour or principal of a 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.850
 roulette of tail and two balancine 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.560
 fixed under each wing the roulette of 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.660
 tail and the front gear are 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.630
 usually coupled to the rudder for 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.060
 make the train easier 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.680
 landing can be fixed or 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.990
 retractable 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.360
 in this case they fall back into 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.790
 housings located in the fuselage in 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.720
 wings 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.720
 or in the pods
