00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
Abby's ultimate meet complex and so it

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.870 
Abby's ultimate meet complex and so it
helps<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.670> body<00:02:11.790> metabolize<00:02:12.480> fats<00:02:13.110> and

proteins<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> carbs<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.660> take<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:15.989> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
proteins and carbs so I take one of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.890 
proteins and carbs so I take one of
these<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> day<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.830> find<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.150> believe

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
these a day I find that it I believe

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.650 
these a day I find that it I believe
this<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.980> makes<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.910> pee<00:02:20.970> like

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
this is the one that makes my pee like

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.910 
this is the one that makes my pee like
bright<00:02:22.019> yellow<00:02:22.850> take<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> vitamin<00:02:24.180> E<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.049> just<00:02:25.739> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
bright yellow take a vitamin E so just a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.890 
bright yellow take a vitamin E so just a
good<00:02:26.130> antioxidant<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.180> good<00:02:27.329> milk<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.780> then

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
good antioxidant for good milk and then

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.990 
good antioxidant for good milk and then
also<00:02:28.340> magnesium<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.549> just<00:02:29.670> started<00:02:29.790> taking

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
also magnesium so I just started taking

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.110 
also magnesium so I just started taking
this<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.840> obviously<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.519> an<00:02:32.519> electrolyte

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
this one it's obviously a an electrolyte

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990 
this one it's obviously a an electrolyte
so<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.750> trying<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.350> prevent<00:02:35.040> Kyoto<00:02:35.610> flow<00:02:35.850> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so I'm trying to prevent Kyoto flow this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
so I'm trying to prevent Kyoto flow this
time<00:02:36.209> around<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> these<00:02:37.829> men<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.329> taking<00:02:40.320> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
time around one of these men so taking a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.160 
time around one of these men so taking a
calcium<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.250> vitamin<00:02:41.579> D<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.900> good

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
calcium and vitamin D just for like good

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
calcium and vitamin D just for like good
bones<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:43.920> through<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.430> stuff

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
bones and going through all that stuff

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.690 
bones and going through all that stuff
and<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.810> don't<00:02:46.170> know<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:46.560> way<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.400> i

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and I don't know which way it is but i

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.479 
and I don't know which way it is but i
believe<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.510> vitamin<00:02:48.930> D<00:02:49.500> helps<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.070> calcium

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
believe the vitamin D helps the calcium

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.880 
believe the vitamin D helps the calcium
absorb<00:02:50.970> more<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.750> other<00:02:51.930> way<00:02:52.079> around<00:02:52.110> so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
absorb more or the other way around so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.780 
absorb more or the other way around so
that's<00:02:53.070> why<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that's why it's good to have a

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.490 
that's why it's good to have a
combination<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.230> then<00:02:55.739> my<00:02:56.220> last<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
combination and then my last one is the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.250 
combination and then my last one is the
omega<00:02:58.500> three<00:02:59.340> six<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.670> nine<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.329> fatty<00:03:00.780> acids

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
omega three six and nine so fatty acids

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.110 
omega three six and nine so fatty acids
only<00:03:01.590> take<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.950> those<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.070> day<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.640> haven't
