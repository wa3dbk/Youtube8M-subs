00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
smells like the hair has been dyed a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.480 
smells like the hair has been dyed a
little<00:02:59.540> bit<00:02:59.660> but<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.110> could<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:01.100> from

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
little bit but that could just be from

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.720 
little bit but that could just be from
the<00:03:01.790> steam<00:03:02.090> process<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:03.470> curly<00:03:03.980> virgin<00:03:04.550> hair

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the steam process that curly virgin hair

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.220 
the steam process that curly virgin hair
grows<00:03:05.030> through<00:03:05.330> especially<00:03:05.540> stuff<00:03:06.050> like

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
grows through especially stuff like

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.410 
grows through especially stuff like
stuff<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.550> it's<00:03:07.790> gonna<00:03:07.940> go<00:03:08.120> through<00:03:08.390> a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
stuff like this it's gonna go through a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.150 
stuff like this it's gonna go through a
steam<00:03:08.630> process<00:03:09.080> which<00:03:09.620> does<00:03:09.830> not<00:03:09.980> necessarily

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
steam process which does not necessarily

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.620 
steam process which does not necessarily
mean<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.320> it's<00:03:12.320> been<00:03:12.560> dyed<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.640> will<00:03:14.030> make

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
mean it's it's been dyed but I will make

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.840 
mean it's it's been dyed but I will make
a<00:03:14.690> video<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.440> washing<00:03:16.040> hair<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.640> only

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
bit dry looking but not too bad like

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.590 
bit dry looking but not too bad like
it's<00:03:25.340> not<00:03:25.520> like<00:03:25.580> fixable

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
you know that is not fixable and this is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.040 
you know that is not fixable and this is
what<00:03:28.820> her<00:03:28.940> label<00:03:29.180> looks<00:03:29.510> like<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.930> then

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
what her label looks like and then

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.330 
what her label looks like and then
