00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hello, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 connect the xbox to the computer 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.880
 these videos for those who have 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.040
 old attitudes of wifi and its router 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.330
 for example as in my case in the living room 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.270
 what you need will be a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.910
 internet cable that usually comes with the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.420
 as always with the Xbox as always no 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.850
 let's hope and connect it to the port of 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.510
 computer in case it's a laptop 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.510
 I say 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.450
 the control panel is there 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 where they put networks on the internet we are going to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.550
 wake up in front 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.220
 adapter configuration 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.750
 then we will stress 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.380
 ordered milestones 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.380
 and good 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.490
 it will not come out 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.490
 this wireless 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.970
 and in the carpool sale 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.719
 two 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.550
 then the configuration 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.250
 this is that it starts that is connected 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.320
 to the xbox we are eliminating this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.410
 also that is all projects 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.440
 marked then we will accept and accept 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.440
 we only have to turn on the xbox 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.620
 Y 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 here when I put network cable not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.450
 identified even though you put that already 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.950
 here is the unidentified king is already 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 Conected to internet 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.530
 although sometimes it usually happens that it takes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.310
 much in showing our profile 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.590
 means that we will have to go back to 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.050
 make the step from earl to properties and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.160
 to accept it again then it will not come out 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.160
 and here, too 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.170
 As you can see, it has already come out quite soon 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.170
 and we go to my profile 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 and they are already connected and for 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.290
 that you see that it is not a false 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.290
 nothing you see that is the xbox 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.230
 normal stream does not have wifi or anything 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.360
 then to check it we go 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.400
 directly 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.080
 the configuration in system 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 then network configuration 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.540
 the one that we have and we're going to test connection 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.849
 to live xbox and then it 's all 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.190
 right and good up here the video 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.010
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.340
