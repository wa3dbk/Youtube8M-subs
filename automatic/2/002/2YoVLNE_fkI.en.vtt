 megapixels the front of 2 megapixels 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.179
 and inside a ram giga apart 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.829
 to process a gig of ram and 8 16 gb of 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.039
 internal memory that we can expand with 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.549
 another 32 through a micro card 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.590
 sd battery 4 thousand 290 million is now 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.039
 an android 4.4 we do not know if it's going to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.110
 launch with power to upgrade to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.970
 lollipop and an important thing has 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.799
 support the price of these new 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.939
 8-inch tablet models 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.619
 lenovo is 179 american dollars 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.299
 we also have the again is 2 to 10 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.909
 on a tablet that changes a lot in 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.530
 explanations and everything else because 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.530
 It is a 10 inches available to be 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.810
 exact a resolution of 1920 x 1200 in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.280
 its screen ips the processor is a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 mediatek helmet 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.130
 to one with 5 gigahertz with support 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.600
 64 bits 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.040
 the frames here are a little more united 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.040
 but they are not small, of course, to the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 back we found this band of 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.140
 speaker with the technology we would say the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.800
 camera and again the stage that protects 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.260
 the ports for microsd and for 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.590
 cards and that as we said it gives 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.230
 support for connectivity lte has two 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.240
 cameras the rear of 8 the front of 5 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.010
 and inside we find 2 gigas of ram 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.300
 it's probably the combination of the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.220
 teacher make it possible that in 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.260
 this case does not go integrated 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.140
 android 5.0 the only difference of 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.270
 8-inch model are again 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.710
 protagonist both the connectivity as 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.430
 the two-way support that we had 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.760
 seen in the 7,000 and also in the 68 and 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.190
 the price of this model is 279 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.150
 dollars with the last of stable 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.950
 novelty of lenovo is the mix with 210 300 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.650
 8-inch is a tablet that instead 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.950
 from android is passed to windows 8.1 once 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.420
 what to remove contributes more to that extra 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.430
 productivity the operating system of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.319
 microsoft an 8 inch screen with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.590
 resolution of 1280 x 8 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.959
 pixels acb or is an intel atom of the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 Family 23 has up to 2 GB of memory 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.700
 ram up to 64 gigabytes of capacity 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.099
 overcrowding and in cameras 5 in the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.780
 rear 2 on the front and as we say 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.079
 the most prominent feature is the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.329
 Windows 8 support that good that 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.069
 allows us to have at our disposal a 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.260
 8-inch tablet with a price 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.260
 really attractive 149 euros 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.500
 the tablet again and the design of people 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.599
 apart , that finish that simulates 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.689
 the metallic finish the band of 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.670
 speakers and the camera in this case 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.590
 we have a micro sd but be careful because 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.620
 as opposed to those that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.140
 tablets that we've seen with lte there's no 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.140
 lt there is no tlc support in this model
