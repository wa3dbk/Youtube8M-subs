 impressive the city also has a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 singular history 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.730
 in the port of imperia lends face to 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.259
 this story and evokes the council the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.000
 local historian tells the 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.369
 visitors anecdotes of that congress 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 medieval ecclesiastical in which certain 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.370
 ladies also played a role 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.550
 we know that constanza had then 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.470
 about 5000 inhabitants during the council 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.290
 of 1400 14,418 they were overwhelmed by 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.230
 the arrival of 35,000 people from all 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.600
 type of origin and trades we know 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.260
 for example that they worked about 700 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.640
 joyful women 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.770
 Courtesans are not likely 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.769
 were present in the cathedral of 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.629
 ecclesiastics and scholars 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.330
 they argued about who would be the new 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.350
 dad and they set out to end the dark 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.350
 time of the schism 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.500
 the conclave the papal election 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 properly said here the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 council building had a function 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.479
 rather earthly it was a center 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 commercial of 1,388 was used for the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 only papal election held to the north 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 of the Alps because unlike the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.510
 conclave hall in the east cathedral 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.140
 great bazaar was safer easier to 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:40.980
 close and control with 1,417 king 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 fifth was elected pope in this room 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.360
 but now we have to hoist the sails or 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 give them to the pedals and set course on 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.670
 next destination a lane 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 bicycles surround the lake of constanza 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 from constanza you can go for example 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.750
 to the nearby monastery island of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 arraijanal an agricultural paradise the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.330
 growing vegetables or fishing have 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.880
 a long tradition 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.830
 the monks of the monastery introduced 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.380
 agriculture in reichenau centuries ago 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.619
 an economic structure that remains 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.619
 until today 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.280
 well worth a visit but also for 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 another reason 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.700
 there is something very interesting and it is that 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.980
 we keep our three churches 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.350
 Romanesque products are also declared 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 World Heritage are churches 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.340
 very interesting that allow to be made 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.120
 an idea of â€‹â€‹the monastic architecture of 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.769
 in the ninth century it is famous for its 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.080
 Fresh one of the reasons why 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.730
 Reichenau occupies an important place in 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.730
 the history of European art of the time 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.889
 still missing the cathedral and the church of 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.989
 san pedro and san pablo to which the 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.350

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.990
 The center of interest of the island is the 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.600
 palace inhabited until today by the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.060
