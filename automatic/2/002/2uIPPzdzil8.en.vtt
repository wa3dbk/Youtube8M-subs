00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
inventor of the Momo bike motor we're

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.690 
inventor of the Momo bike motor we're
here<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.910> Danville<00:00:09.179> Virginia<00:00:09.480> USA<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:11.099> is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
here in Danville Virginia USA it is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610 
here in Danville Virginia USA it is
about<00:00:11.910> thirty<00:00:12.240> five<00:00:12.450> degrees<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.200> now<00:00:13.230> it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
about thirty five degrees right now it's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220 
about thirty five degrees right now it's
cold<00:00:13.889> freezing<00:00:14.730> um<00:00:15.179> yeah<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.109> pretty

freezing basically I came up with the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
freezing basically I came up with the
idea<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.550> bike<00:00:20.789> motor<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.390> just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
idea of this bike motor it was just

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.970 
idea of this bike motor it was just
something<00:00:21.779> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.140> crazy<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.680> everybody

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
something kind of crazy and everybody

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
something kind of crazy and everybody
told<00:00:23.160> me<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.400> wouldn't<00:00:23.609> work<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.539> works

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
told me it wouldn't work and it works

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.259 
told me it wouldn't work and it works
great<00:00:24.949> I've<00:00:25.949> had<00:00:26.189> every<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.789> bike<00:00:26.970> motor

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
great I've had every kind of bike motor

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
great I've had every kind of bike motor
there<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.570> I've<00:00:28.410> had<00:00:28.680> friction<00:00:29.189> drive<00:00:29.460> I've

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
there is I've had friction drive I've

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.130 
there is I've had friction drive I've
had<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.390> cycles

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
had two cycles

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
had two cycles
I<00:00:31.170> sold<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.189> cycle<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> internet<00:00:33.149> for

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I sold the two cycle on the internet for

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
I sold the two cycle on the internet for
about<00:00:33.989> ten<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.559> well<00:00:34.739> several<00:00:35.670> years

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
about ten get well several years

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
about ten get well several years
this<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.340> gets<00:00:38.760> approximately

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this one right here gets approximately

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.650 
this one right here gets approximately
120<00:00:40.290> miles<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> gallon<00:00:41.190> pivot<00:00:42.149> our<00:00:42.329> three

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
120 miles to the gallon pivot our three

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
120 miles to the gallon pivot our three
and<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.809> half<00:00:43.020> horsepower<00:00:43.379> let<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
and a half horsepower let me show you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.540 
and a half horsepower let me show you
over<00:00:44.160> here

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
over here

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.569 
over here
now<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> rough<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.469> rough<00:00:47.190> prototype

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
now this is a rough a rough prototype

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.090 
now this is a rough a rough prototype
right<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.410> rust<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
right now so it's got some rust and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
right now so it's got some rust and
stuff<00:00:50.309> I've<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> powder-coated

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
stuff I've got to get a powder-coated

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
stuff I've got to get a powder-coated
