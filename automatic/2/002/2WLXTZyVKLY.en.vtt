00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
eventually they want to support like a

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.030 
eventually they want to support like a
mile<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.380> to<00:00:43.470> do<00:00:43.560> something<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
do a boardslide on a hand now you need

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
do a boardslide on a hand now you need
to<00:00:53.790> start<00:00:54.059> by<00:00:54.270> having<00:00:54.480> board<00:00:54.870> slides<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.950> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to start by having board slides so you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.350 
to start by having board slides so you
want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.670> something<00:00:57.000> small

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
want to do this on something small

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.869 
want to do this on something small
escape<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> black<00:00:58.800> bar<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.430> low<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
escape like a black bar that's low the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
escape like a black bar that's low the
grounded<00:01:00.330> you<00:01:00.600> feel<00:01:00.809> safe<00:01:04.010> once<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.250> home

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
grounded you feel safe once you get home

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.140 
grounded you feel safe once you get home
and<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and do it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
and do it
you<00:01:06.480> then<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.870> it<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.230> a<00:01:07.260> handrail<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you then take it to a handrail on this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210 
you then take it to a handrail on this
base<00:01:09.210> part<00:01:09.480> that's<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.350> down<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.950> stairs

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
base part that's going down some stairs

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
base part that's going down some stairs
so<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.490> start<00:01:11.850> getting<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.210> feeling<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so you start getting a feeling of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.980 
so you start getting a feeling of
falling<00:01:13.110> onto<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.740> Ryland<00:01:14.280> coming<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
falling onto a Ryland coming down so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
falling onto a Ryland coming down so
you've<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.560> confidence<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you've got your confidence now and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
you've got your confidence now and
you're<00:01:17.670> ready<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> legitimate

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you're ready to take it to a legitimate

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
you're ready to take it to a legitimate
handrail<00:01:19.860> there's<00:01:20.220> something<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.550> six<00:01:20.850> or

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
handrail there's something like a six or

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
handrail there's something like a six or
a<00:01:21.090> seven<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.659> eight<00:01:21.690> static<00:01:22.260> handrail<00:01:22.620> in<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a seven or an eight static handrail in a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
a seven or an eight static handrail in a
skatepark<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.700> great<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.120> practice<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.600> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
skatepark is great to practice on so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240 
skatepark is great to practice on so
first<00:01:25.170> things<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> gauge

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
first things first you want to gauge

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.250 
first things first you want to gauge
speed<00:01:26.940> you're<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> handle<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
speed you're going to do the handle you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.930 
speed you're going to do the handle you
don't<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.710> too<00:01:28.770> slow<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.760> go<00:01:29.880> too

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
don't want to go too slow if you go too

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.050 
don't want to go too slow if you go too
slow<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.590> clear<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.520> rail<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.940> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
slow you will not clear the rail if you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
slow you will not clear the rail if you
bail<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.930> land<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.380> balls<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
bail and you can land on your balls so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.290 
bail and you can land on your balls so
this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.490> important<00:01:35.910> thing<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
this is a very important thing when you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.690 
this is a very important thing when you
do<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> handrail<00:01:36.870> you<00:01:37.080> need<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.410> have<00:01:37.530> speed<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
do a handrail you need to have speed so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
do a handrail you need to have speed so
you're<00:01:38.850> always<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.360> clear<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.810> steps<00:01:40.080> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you're always gonna clear the steps and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.860 
you're always gonna clear the steps and
the<00:01:40.440> rail<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.860> anything<00:01:41.280> happens<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> need<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
the rail if anything happens you need to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.290 
the rail if anything happens you need to
approach<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.470> rail<00:01:43.590> parallel<00:01:44.190> then<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.150> you

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
approach the rail parallel then as you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.240 
approach the rail parallel then as you
get<00:01:45.480> close<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.050> you're<00:01:46.230> gonna<00:01:46.320> hop<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
get close or you're gonna hop and do a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.610 
get close or you're gonna hop and do a
90<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.760> grow<00:01:47.940> ollie<00:01:48.150> into<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.810> hand<00:01:49.050> round<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
90 to grow ollie into the hand round you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.950 
90 to grow ollie into the hand round you
want<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.040> real<00:01:50.370> good<00:01:50.790> pop<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
want to get a real good pop and get you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.570 
want to get a real good pop and get you
high<00:01:52.350> above<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.950> round<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:53.430> you're

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
high above the round so you're

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.600 
high above the round so you're
positioned<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.050> good<00:01:55.320> balance<00:01:56.010> point
