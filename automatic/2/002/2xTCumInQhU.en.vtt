00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.880
 let's proceed to clean the ham 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.310
 for its very fundamental tasting the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.450
 hoof up 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.730
 it's a day up 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.460
 deep cut at the height of the choir 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.879
 best 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.879
 rigid blade knife and butcher 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.220
 then let's clean it with art and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.490
 very slowly water breaks the popular and 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.490
 Diego 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.380
 do not 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 do not 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.710
 ah 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.420
 i 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.420
 i 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.050
 here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 do not 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.160
 now 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 all right 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.000
 not wish you good government 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.870
 with the cut of ham 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.490
 every time one more language is created 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.640
 encoded 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.400
 that sometimes establishes relationships 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.880
 with the world and the language of art and 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.260
 that is an art the subject of the ham arrived 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.209
 let's play a little por soleÃ¡ 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.280
 there are four pillars that sustain the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.129
 cutting of ham and tasting and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.189
 tasting that on the color the flavor the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.379
 texture and aromas but for those 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.200
 four points are in their pure state 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.989
 there is a fundamental basis to cut the ham 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.590
 at the right temperature and a soap does not 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.140
 it should be tasted at less than 24 degrees 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 since soap is cardiosaludable is 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.069
 anti aggressive communicate meets penetrates 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.579
 the senses and the language he has is 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.190
 universal I say that gathers because here my 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.640
 friends have eaten the almost a quarter 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.740
 of soap 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.280
 you know if I keep cutting or not 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.280
 I follow the portal 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.290
 that penetrates two senses clear that 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.140
 penetrates the senses 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.560
 why 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.569
 soap 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.620
 the tasting 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.620
 it's an art 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.420
 and in each of its slices 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.020
 this chalk 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.420
 all the magic of our land in what 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:31.330
 which makes him perhaps the greatest 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.330
 ambassador of our culinary culture
