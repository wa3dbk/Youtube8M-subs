00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.100 

to<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:33.570> handy<00:01:33.960> dandy

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

to get it out you need this handy dandy
little<00:01:35.509> special<00:01:36.509> socket<00:01:37.020> ooh<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.829> Cleary

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
little special socket ooh that's Cleary

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.050 
little special socket ooh that's Cleary
and<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.939> these<00:01:39.650> ridges<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.060> better

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and it's got these ridges on it better

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.770 
and it's got these ridges on it better
I'll<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> better<00:01:43.740> on

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.690 

that<00:01:48.780> one's<00:01:49.079> too<00:01:49.320> flashy<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> see

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
that one's too flashy but you can see

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
that one's too flashy but you can see
there<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> regular<00:01:52.320> socket

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there it's not like a regular socket

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
there it's not like a regular socket
it's<00:01:53.070> got<00:01:53.219> these<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.399> ridges<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.270> does

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it's got these little ridges but it does

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.679 
it's got these little ridges but it does
have<00:01:55.340> flat<00:01:56.340> sides<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:56.969> guess<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.450> could<00:01:57.659> use

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
have flat sides so I guess you could use

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
have flat sides so I guess you could use
a<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.229> big<00:01:58.350> ass<00:01:58.679> deep<00:01:59.130> sealed<00:01:59.429> socket<00:01:59.850> if

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
a really big ass deep sealed socket if

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
a really big ass deep sealed socket if
you<00:02:00.030> wanted<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.960> could<00:02:01.049> try<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.350> can't

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you wanted to you could try it can't

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.080 
you wanted to you could try it can't
promise<00:02:02.399> anything<00:02:03.229> anyway<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:05.700> better<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
promise anything anyway it's better to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.080 
promise anything anyway it's better to
use<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.780> regular<00:02:07.590> sized<00:02:07.979> socket<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.729> medium

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
use a regular sized socket the medium

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.259 
use a regular sized socket the medium
size<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:10.170> an<00:02:10.289> extension<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.970> adapter

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
size with an extension and this adapter

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.820 
size with an extension and this adapter
that<00:02:12.720> goes<00:02:12.870> from<00:02:13.049> 3/8<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.830> 1/2<00:02:14.180> or<00:02:15.319> got<00:02:16.319> 3/8<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
that goes from 3/8 to 1/2 or got 3/8 to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.550 
that goes from 3/8 to 1/2 or got 3/8 to
1/2<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.629> use<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.019> socket<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
1/2 and then use that socket the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.120 
1/2 and then use that socket the
extension<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.910> adapter<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.680> socket

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
extension or the adapter and the socket

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.620 
extension or the adapter and the socket
the<00:02:23.340> socket<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.599> $10<00:02:25.220> mix

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
the socket is going to be like $10 mix

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.110 
the socket is going to be like $10 mix
adapter<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:27.989> was<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.200> 5<00:02:29.120> anyway<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
adapter I think was like 5 anyway so the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.400 
adapter I think was like 5 anyway so the
problem<00:02:33.450> you're<00:02:33.569> going<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> come<00:02:33.930> into<00:02:34.079> when

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
problem you're going to come into when

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.430 
problem you're going to come into when
you<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.620> back<00:02:34.799> there<00:02:35.069> though<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:36.140> hands<00:02:37.140> on

this<00:02:47.549> thing<00:02:48.769> that's<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.950> class<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> had

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
this thing that's the class for it I had

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.740 
this thing that's the class for it I had
a<00:02:51.120> break<00:02:51.780> cap<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.410> class<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.370> anyway

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
a break cap the class off but anyway

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.910 
a break cap the class off but anyway
there's<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:55.019> back<00:02:55.500> clasp<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:57.120> faces<00:02:57.600> down

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
there's this back clasp that faces down

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.430 
there's this back clasp that faces down
and<00:02:58.920> it's<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.739> clasp<00:03:02.040> face<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.900> driver's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
and it's the clasp face the driver's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.360 
and it's the clasp face the driver's
side<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.170> can't<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.739> them<00:03:07.859> because<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
side and you can't see them because the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.039 
side and you can't see them because the
distributor<00:03:08.880> caps<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.359> way<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.870> just

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
distributor caps in the way so you just

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.430 
distributor caps in the way so you just
kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.290> guess<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:11.209> did<00:03:12.239> let's<00:03:12.870> stick<00:03:13.079> my<00:03:13.230> phone

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
kind of guess I did let's stick my phone

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.400 
kind of guess I did let's stick my phone
down<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.780> videotape<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.200> would

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
down there and videotape it but would

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.319 
down there and videotape it but would
and<00:03:16.680> eventually<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.639> got<00:03:17.910> pissed<00:03:18.180> off

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
and eventually I just got pissed off

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.020 
and eventually I just got pissed off
jiggling<00:03:18.870> around<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.579> might<00:03:20.730> be<00:03:20.760> better

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
jiggling around and it might be better

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.129 
jiggling around and it might be better
for<00:03:21.150> anybody<00:03:21.780> else<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.620> -

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
for anybody else just to do this -

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.199 
for anybody else just to do this -
there's<00:03:25.139> two<00:03:25.410> parts<00:03:25.799> there's<00:03:26.579> this<00:03:26.700> plastic

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
there's two parts there's this plastic

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.789 
there's two parts there's this plastic
piece<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.590> actual<00:03:28.920> metal<00:03:29.519> screw<00:03:30.799> that

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
piece and the actual metal screw that

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.599 
piece and the actual metal screw that
goes<00:03:31.980> into<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
goes into it

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.240 
goes into it
and<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:34.790> if<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.090> see<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.389> orange<00:03:36.630> line

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
and it's if you can see that orange line

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.140 
and it's if you can see that orange line
that's<00:03:38.250> where<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.549> plastic<00:03:39.060> connects<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
that's where the plastic connects to the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.080 
that's where the plastic connects to the
metal<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.169> little<00:03:43.349> gasket<00:03:43.620> thing

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
metal it's like a little gasket thing

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.129 
metal it's like a little gasket thing
anyway<00:03:45.090> what<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.359> do<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.630> mine<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.079> just

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
anyway what I do with mine is I just

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.599 
anyway what I do with mine is I just
jiggled<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:47.329> until<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.480> plastic<00:03:48.900> piece<00:03:49.609> broke

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
jiggled it until the plastic piece broke

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.509 
jiggled it until the plastic piece broke
off<00:03:51.019> along<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.739> know<00:03:52.829> broke<00:03:53.069> away<00:03:53.190> from<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
off along you know broke away from the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.370 
off along you know broke away from the
adapter<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:55.019> fits<00:03:55.200> together

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
adapter and it fits together

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.020 
adapter and it fits together
like<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.740> just<00:03:59.920> jiggle<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.670> until<00:04:00.910> that

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
like so and I just jiggle it until that

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.680 
like so and I just jiggle it until that
snapped<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.590> when<00:04:02.710> that<00:04:02.830> snapped<00:04:03.220> apart

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
snapped and when that snapped apart

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.670 
snapped and when that snapped apart
would<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.810> very<00:04:05.050> careful<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.590> don't

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
would be very careful so you don't

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.930 
would be very careful so you don't
damage<00:04:06.040> your<00:04:07.470> claps<00:04:08.470> or<00:04:09.370> your<00:04:10.200> connector

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
damage your claps or your connector

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.130 
damage your claps or your connector
anyway<00:04:12.940> when<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.240> break<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.480> you're<00:04:13.930> able

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
anyway when you break that you're able

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.400 
anyway when you break that you're able
to<00:04:14.170> do<00:04:14.380> jiggle<00:04:14.740> it<00:04:14.830> up<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.640> can<00:04:15.760> see<00:04:15.910> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
to do jiggle it up and you can see the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.600 
to do jiggle it up and you can see the
clamps<00:04:17.410> will<00:04:17.560> better<00:04:17.830> stick<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> flathead

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
clamps will better stick a flathead

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.130 
clamps will better stick a flathead
under<00:04:18.820> there<00:04:18.970> pop<00:04:19.270> it<00:04:19.420> out<00:04:19.860> so<00:04:20.860> this<00:04:21.700> thing<00:04:22.140> is

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
under there pop it out so this thing is

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.640 
under there pop it out so this thing is
piece<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.770> junk<00:04:23.980> it's<00:04:24.550> probably<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.210> original

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
piece of junk it's probably the original

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.730 
piece of junk it's probably the original
you<00:04:26.650> can<00:04:26.830> see<00:04:26.980> all<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.310> grime<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.740> built

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
you can see all the grime and built

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.380 
you can see all the grime and built
up<00:04:29.980> over<00:04:30.280> there<00:04:30.430> over<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.670> years<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.090> inside

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
up over there over the years the inside

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.350 
up over there over the years the inside
looks<00:04:31.690> okay<00:04:32.370> not<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.400> burnt<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.210> it's

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
looks okay not really burnt but it's

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.940 
looks okay not really burnt but it's
probably<00:04:34.720> wore<00:04:34.900> out<00:04:35.050> really<00:04:35.410> bad

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
probably wore out really bad

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.850 
probably wore out really bad
so<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:37.800> is<00:04:38.880> junk

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
so that is junk

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.140 
so that is junk
so<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.100> chunk<00:04:42.520> but<00:04:42.730> I'm<00:04:42.880> not<00:04:42.970> going<00:04:43.120> to

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
so is that chunk but I'm not going to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.790 
so is that chunk but I'm not going to
throw<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.860> anyway<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:46.350> getting<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.440> back<00:04:47.560> in

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
throw that anyway so getting it back in

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.110 
throw that anyway so getting it back in
is<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.010> easy<00:04:48.130> part<00:04:48.220> all<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.670> got<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:48.910> do<00:04:48.970> is

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
is the easy part all you got to do is

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880 
is the easy part all you got to do is
just<00:04:49.870> finger<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.320> around<00:04:50.560> till<00:04:50.800> you

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
just finger it around till you

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.400 
just finger it around till you
get<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.160> threads<00:04:51.610> lined<00:04:51.880> up<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:53.200> hole

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
get the threads lined up and the hole

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.840 
get the threads lined up and the hole
and<00:04:53.950> screw<00:04:54.730> it<00:04:54.850> back<00:04:54.970> in<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:56.670> torque<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.790> down

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
and screw it back in and torque it down

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.190 
and screw it back in and torque it down
a<00:04:58.000> little<00:04:58.180> bit<00:04:58.330> with<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.570> socket<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.990> socket

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
a little bit with the socket the socket

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.030 
a little bit with the socket the socket

this is also this is the 5.9 I don't
know<00:05:40.840> if<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.160> 5.2<00:05:42.390> it's<00:05:43.390> built<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.810> same<00:05:43.990> way

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.470 
know if the 5.2 it's built the same way
it<00:05:44.740> may<00:05:44.890> be<00:05:44.920> located<00:05:45.340> somewhere<00:05:45.820> else<00:05:46.090> and

was<00:06:15.949> getting<00:06:16.220> annoying<00:06:16.430> so<00:06:17.169> there's<00:06:18.169> my<00:06:18.289> day

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
was getting annoying so there's my day

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.950 
was getting annoying so there's my day
off<00:06:18.680> today<00:06:18.860> so<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.550> thought<00:06:20.270> I'd<00:06:20.449> fix<00:06:20.660> it<00:06:20.780> real

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
off today so I thought I'd fix it real

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.920 
off today so I thought I'd fix it real
quick<00:06:21.199> and<00:06:22.060> so<00:06:23.060> I<00:06:23.090> don't<00:06:23.330> know<00:06:23.419> if<00:06:23.509> it<00:06:23.599> was<00:06:23.720> this

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
quick and so I don't know if it was this

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.300 
quick and so I don't know if it was this
exactly<00:06:24.819> but<00:06:25.819> I<00:06:26.180> figure<00:06:26.860> if<00:06:27.860> that's<00:06:28.069> going<00:06:28.250> to

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
exactly but I figure if that's going to

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.680 
exactly but I figure if that's going to
be<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.460> problem<00:06:28.819> I<00:06:29.000> might<00:06:29.180> as<00:06:29.270> well<00:06:29.330> get<00:06:29.539> it

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
be the problem I might as well get it

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.550 
be the problem I might as well get it
and<00:06:29.840> fly<00:06:30.410> switch<00:06:30.979> it<00:06:31.099> out<00:06:31.250> and<00:06:32.050> I'm<00:06:33.050> also<00:06:33.289> doing

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
and fly switch it out and I'm also doing

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.760 
and fly switch it out and I'm also doing
an<00:06:33.979> oil<00:06:34.460> change<00:06:34.810> with<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.840> heavier<00:06:36.530> weight<00:06:36.710> oil

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
an oil change with a heavier weight oil

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.760 
an oil change with a heavier weight oil
that<00:06:37.430> fixes<00:06:37.880> it<00:06:38.080> kind<00:06:39.080> of<00:06:39.169> too<00:06:41.259> but<00:06:42.259> it's<00:06:42.530> a

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
that fixes it kind of too but it's a

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.450 
that fixes it kind of too but it's a
it's<00:06:43.490> a<00:06:43.580> fairly<00:06:43.940> cheap<00:06:44.740> fix<00:06:45.740> you<00:06:46.160> know<00:06:46.250> it's

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
it's a fairly cheap fix you know it's

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.420 
it's a fairly cheap fix you know it's
not<00:06:46.610> going<00:06:46.729> to<00:06:46.820> set<00:06:47.000> you<00:06:47.120> back<00:06:47.300> a<00:06:47.630> lot<00:06:48.310> like<00:06:49.310> the

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
not going to set you back a lot like the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.279 
not going to set you back a lot like the
Platinum<00:06:49.639> gasket<00:06:50.180> will<00:06:50.360> that's<00:06:50.870> going<00:06:51.110> to<00:06:51.169> be

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
Platinum gasket will that's going to be

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:57.189 
Platinum gasket will that's going to be
it<00:06:51.729> asked<00:06:52.729> to<00:06:53.000> do<00:06:53.590> but<00:06:54.590> you<00:06:55.580> know<00:06:55.669> it's<00:06:56.199> the

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
it asked to do but you know it's the

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.659 
it asked to do but you know it's the
might<00:06:57.530> as<00:06:57.620> well<00:06:57.710> go<00:06:57.830> ahead<00:06:57.860> and<00:06:58.039> change<00:06:58.400> out<00:06:58.639> a

00:06:58.659 --> 00:06:58.669 
might as well go ahead and change out a

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.909 
might as well go ahead and change out a
a<00:06:59.470> 16<00:07:00.470> year<00:07:00.620> old<00:07:00.680> 17<00:07:01.639> 18<00:07:02.000> year<00:07:02.150> old<00:07:02.300> part<00:07:02.889> with<00:07:03.889> a

a 16 year old 17 18 year old part with a

a 16 year old 17 18 year old part with a
new<00:07:04.130> part<00:07:04.400> anyway<00:07:04.759> that's<00:07:05.360> fairly<00:07:05.720> cheap<00:07:05.960> even

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
new part anyway that's fairly cheap even

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.520 
new part anyway that's fairly cheap even
if<00:07:06.680> it's<00:07:06.830> not<00:07:06.949> burnt<00:07:07.280> out<00:07:08.139> while<00:07:09.139> you're<00:07:09.289> doing
