 welcome to this series 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.610
 which is 5 tips 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.960
 we will see each episode 5 tips 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.480
 on a specific theme 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.119
 today we will talk about the beach out 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.779
 must-have games from the server and pqube 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.399
 let's go to tips on cube spikes he 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.730
 currently exists two maps 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.260
 the mac ice arena and fantasia they have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 both their benefits and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.770
 constraints 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.590
 we are interested in the map fantasia 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.660
 This is made up of four branches 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.530
 connect form a circle around a 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.020
 central building 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.650
 I will give you some tips on 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.110
 this map 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.870
 in this image you will see in red 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.410
 danger zones and blue zones 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.360
 most secure in my opinion indeed 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.360
 here are three potential enemies 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.040
 I am the point fr if they pull me a 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.869
 arrow to where I am I do not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.909
 could not be pushed into the void 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.439
 if you want to knock down an enemy 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.350
 that he uses your technique 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.360
 you just have to stand here or there and the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.630
 trains market quite competent for the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 touched by far this trick therefore allows 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.860
 to find a point of the most secure 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.950
 on the map to avoid losing 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.770
 your hearts for the second trick 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.990
 passion to the map called ice arena one 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.690
 it is circular and includes in its 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.460
 middle an accessible platform 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.200
 the strategy I'm using and getting 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.330
 position on this platform 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.330
 indeed if a person touches you 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.340
 you can not die you will be 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.659
 simply get off your platform 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 from this point 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.490
 you can also reach all 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.590
 Queen's players therefore attack your 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.729
 opponents with your arrows for 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.130
 that they lose their lives the most 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 as quickly as possible in this 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.939
 third tips i'm going to show you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.619
 how are you a player who would have taken 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.670
 possession of the central platform 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.820
 in the ice arena street 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 just take the bow in hand then 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 from the attacked to the melee comes to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.270
 left key this will do 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.270
 drop the opponent into the hole which 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.980
 will aim to take away a heart 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.599
 for the 4th tricks I'm going to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 explain how to counter the most 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.980
 effectively the bac grades 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.850
 firstly, you should never jump 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.100
 pitch out 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.730
 indeed it will make you dangerously 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.950
 back off if you get attacked 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.230
 but if by misfortune you eject 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.019
 by a person use quickly 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.200
 your snick as this will allow you to 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.670
 save your life many times and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
 now this last trick 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.709
 is for those who have the most 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.799
 difficulties in pitch out I can only 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.900
 advise you to avoid the fight in 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.060
 effect by positioning you to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.160
 safe places on the map or in 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.239
 indefinitely circling the amap 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.700
 all along the game 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.670
 you will keep your hearts for 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.680
 compensate for your difficulties 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.750
 then we have to manage to push back your 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.380
 opponents by avoiding it you that 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.790
 turns to eject you into the void 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.450
