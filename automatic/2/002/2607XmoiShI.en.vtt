00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.440
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.060
 win phone 8 this time we bring you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.309
 one of the novelties that has brought 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 I get the windows phones update 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 8.1 preview for the bell or pers nothing else 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 and nothing less than the projection of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 screen in what has been our 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 device that we have this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 installation or this program like you 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.449
 can see let's put in the part of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 here to the bottom that what I am 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 doing with my device in here what 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 what am I doing you can see 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.500
 how it moves basically at par is a 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 fairly simple process really already 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.550
 we did not really need it 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.290
 was surprised because the influx there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.700
 between the device and what there is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 really on the screen is basically 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 I do not know if it can be appreciated there 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.910
 we are going to explain to you how 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.820
 install this program we what 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.739
 we ran in windows 7 64 bit version 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.510
 professional then of course 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.020
 this means that he will be able to run 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.020
 in windows 8.1 so let's start 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.830
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.960
 direct us to the link that I left in the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.910
 part of the description of the video are 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.620
 download an installer of this as 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.330
 this one that we have here weighs less than a 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.920
 megabyte let's give a right click and 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.630
 here where it says properties 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.650
 we probably see the fact 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.960
 that is blocked because it has 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.180
 downloaded from the internet and here we are going to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.950
 give where it says unlock once 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.930
 done this we are going to happen the installer 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.000
 it's a fairly simple installation and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.950
 fast as you can see in this 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.380
 moment will tell me that if 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.510
 we want to change or we want to change 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.700
 repair the installation because I 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.290
 I have it you disappear some 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.210
 configurations but they should leave it like this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 without moving anything once the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
 installation we are going to have two icons 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 like this in our part of the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.550
 desktop what we should do now is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.649
 restart our pc once restarted 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.479
 let's open our application and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.070
 we will see that it is put on screen 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.280
 complete if we press the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 skate or escape key will now make us like 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.470
 a smaller window what 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.350
 we must do now is connect our 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.330
 device to pc let's do this 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
 Once connected, it must appear 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.160
 in our in our cell the fact 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.500
 that if we want to project our 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.510
 our cell phone on the pc as well as 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.190
 you can see it at this time if 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.830
 you are the lucky ones who 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.460
 this message appears there is nothing more than 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.620
 do more than give it a touch itself let's 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.510
 to give a touch if to you in this 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 moment you can see how in 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 our pc is being projected 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.990
 practically at the same time what 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 we are doing in our 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.210
 device here you can see how 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.770
 I can handle it pretty easy and what 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.860
 interesting about this application is that 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.380
 as it gives us a pointer in the part of 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.910
 the configuration of our pc if 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.250
 we want to change some 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.100
 configurations let's go to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.500
 our device and in the part of 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.930
 down here where it says project my 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.450
 screen we are going to give a touch and here we 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.790
 says with what is connected we are going to give 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.590
 a touch who says advanced and tells us 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.150
 show tactile function that is to say that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 show this little dot that we 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.740
 we are marking we can change it by 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 example to a color 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.120
 orange or red and look immediately no 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.490
 change it for those people who do not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.740
 this message appeared directly 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.540
 to project my screen we're going to have 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.330
 to give two clicks here where it says 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.370
 except configuration file once done 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.510
 this double click will appear on the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.150
 part of here below that are 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.740
 installing some drivers once 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.170
 that you have finished installing 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.570
 those controllers are going to try to do 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.690
 the process and now you should project them 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.790
 the screen if still they still do not 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.440
 This message appears as follows: 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.660
 we have to do is direct us to 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.610
 our device manager in 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.440
 the case of windows 7 is a little bit 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.540
 different for windows 8 we're going to 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.840
 direct us to equipment properties of the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.550
 device manager system 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.830
 Take into account that right now our 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.630
 cellular is still connected and in the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.720
 part of here below you can see 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.630
 the option that says universal serial bus 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.250
 devices we are going to have to eliminate the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.739
 three let's give a right click and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.510
 uninstall let's uninstall one by 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.640
 one and if it asks us to restart 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.100
 our pc we are going to have to first 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.250
 delete the three files and then 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.580
 we will restart our device and 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.110
 Now let's re-run 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.000
 again what is being except 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
 configuration file let's connect 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.470
 our device and obviously running 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.640
 this file and again we 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.370
 it will appear that they are installing 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.830
 some controllers and now yes they 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.020
 must send the message in which 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.910
 you are going to be able to project your 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.560
