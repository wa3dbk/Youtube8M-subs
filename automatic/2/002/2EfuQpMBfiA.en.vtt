 air conditioner with fans big 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 performance that creates in 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 cabin overpressure preventing 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 dust penetration from the outside air flow 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.720

 perimeter of doors list of new products 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.680
 complement sliding windows like the driver 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 so and the passenger 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 This allowed to replace the front side 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.860
 vents caused a lot of complaints 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.500
 tractor operators on fixed hermetic

 not a broad overview all this provides 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.999
 operator comfort and ease of operation 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.159
 creating a small oasis at work 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.349
 place under the toughest field conditions and 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.889
 now let's move the engines 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.209
 wide choice is available to the consumer 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.139

 Plant D-260 Minsk Motor Plant 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.900
 Germany rain due to the advent 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.969
 new cars and guns and changes 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.530
 agrotechnologies requiring elevated 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.510
 traction speeds 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 many consumers are interested in 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.980
 installation on the pavement production htz 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.590
 high power engines for example 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.359
 210 or 240 horsepower 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.879
 the installation of such engines became 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.540
 possible after upgrading 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.909
 gear boxes 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.099
 upgraded gearbox affected 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.469
 details that significantly influenced 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.389
 durability increase in words 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.909
 engine performance and improvements 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.879
 consumer properties of the hydra tractor

 significant improved requirements 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.239
 technical properties due to this 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.049
 husband's safety factor is increased in 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.150
 one and a half times 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.340
 Created gearbox 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.000
 which increased the number of gears to 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.250
 16 forward and 8 back instead of 12 and 4 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.979
 maximum tractor speed increased 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.930
 up to forty kilometers per hour instead of 30 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.989
 for the hardening of the input shaft 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.590
 elimination of backlash reduction of wear of the splines 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.630
 and noise 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.000
 set of input shaft instead of sleeve 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.220
 the nut and the threaded nut are installed 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.740
 sleeve with thermo-treated ends 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.900
 instead of ball bearings of a number of shafts 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.449
 installed roller bearings resource 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.430
 which are several times higher 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.289
 new plastic tank repeatedly 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.539
 increased fuel life 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:43.830
 engine instrumentation undoubtedly a plus 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.539
 hydraulic steering systems
