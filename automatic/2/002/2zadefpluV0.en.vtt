00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello to all our stucco columns 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 a new tutorial tips on how 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
 make molds so flexible and not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 expensive since it's with products 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 that can be found everywhere and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 everyday products 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 so I tell you right now for the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 following the video start you will have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 need silicone the precise it is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.390
 enough schools and not putty because 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.070
 that magic will not be flexible with 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.720
 full attention to the well holds 5 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 street 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 you can of course take the first 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.980
 price so I paid them I you 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.079
 returns around 3 euros measures 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930
 then need corn and Nabour 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 corn flour or talent that I 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.190
 could also take flour but 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.920
 I find the result is much less 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.290
 ten rounds we will then need 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.400
 of a container so I took a bowl 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.570
 that I am nothing but for mussels 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.800
 and I want is to take something 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.269
 to mix but these ingredients 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 why announce I pour the quantity 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.720
 desired of what they listen according to the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.729
 size or luckily for you and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.470
 to do next I take my flour from 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.049
 corn and I was born near the same amount 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.200
 of silicone you can add 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.530
 silicone or flour according to your 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.159
 need then it is necessary that the paste does not stick 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.159
 not at all 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.890
 you can simply put the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.600
 flour / hand to take your dough or 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.290
 otherwise I strongly advise you to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 take gloves 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:45.240
 it's very annoying took me off I finished 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.240
 so the mint kneading 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.979
 I get a nice white paw 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 flexible and malleable 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.140
 the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800
 Allah 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.990
 I 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.520
 so we form a ball with our 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 paw and then we will take 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.340
 our object to mold so here I have 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.200
 took an oreo so I'm going of course after 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.200
 throw it directly to the trash 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.460
 I push my object gently and I 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.460
 then go back to the edges 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.280
 okay 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 wrong 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.650
 then leaves us dried during 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.650
 about two hours depending on the cycle 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 1 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.840
 once the world is dry we 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.990
 take off gently our objects 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.990
 molded 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.110
 this is our finished mold so it is 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.810
 flexible and maybe so had it under 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.670
 the water for the question is what these 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.320
 mussels can go to the bottom so this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 just depends on a clause 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.170
 I advise you to read the instructions for 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 see if I can that but if he 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 there is nothing to mark I you 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.090
 therefore advise against putting it in the oven 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.890
 courage dose points record 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.700
 that she will have helped you and that she 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.890
 will have more than you can put a 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.520
 little green thumb and posted a little 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.710
