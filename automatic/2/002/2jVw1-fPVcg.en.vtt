00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.780
 tommy that today I will present a 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.780
 weave destiny the sad arrow 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.700
 then for our tourist braid 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.260
 we need ten children in 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.930
 this case used the chinese 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.900
 nothing from a millimeter but you can 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.419
 also use other measures and these 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.790
 ten wires is important to tie them together with a 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.960
 larger and thicker cord 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.479
 this I used rio and 2 mm 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.089
 after having knotted them all together and 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.400
 put our weight on the cumin for 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.180
 get the job done more 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.070
 let's put the wires inside 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.199
 of the disc 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.100
 then to go and arrange ours 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:03.920
 children on the disc we go to put a 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:08.060
 thread in the top 31 a thread in the top 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 point 32 a thread 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.670
 in point 1 and a thread in point 2 e 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.119
 we have formed a group of four 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:26.179
 let's go and put a stitch in place 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:29.149
 11 a thread in point 12 and a thread in the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.850
 point 13 forming a group of three i 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:39.560
 last three remaining of we go to 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.359
 put in point 22 23 and 24 and finally the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820
 we always leave our cordon 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.560
 left side 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.969
 then once all our own are arranged 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.509
 sons we start with the plot then 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.240
 we move we start by moving the thread that 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.659
 is found at point 31 and we take it to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.140
 point 14 then the thread that I find at mine 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.109
 left side of the group of four lo 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 port to the left side of the group of three 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:13.330
 which he arranged precisely in 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 my right side once inserted there 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 we are the disk in a clockwise direction doing 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.670
 yes that the group of four children who 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.850
 now it has become this one will be found of 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.710
 face us this way once 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.320
 that we are in this position is 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.760
 very important to move the cord 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 on our left side 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.390
 this fundamental step that if there is 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.890
 forget 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.260
 it will not make the rope realize 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.890
 finding ourselves just as precisely in the point 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.010
 initial 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.200
 let's always move the cord 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.140
 of the group of four that is the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.920
 our left side and we take it to the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.840
 left side of the group of three children 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.209
 which is on our right side e 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.850
 we continue turn clockwise 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.590
 always bringing the group from four of 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.660
 in front of us 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.760
 move the cord to the side 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.400
 left 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.290
 the answers I always love the cord that 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.580
 we find on our left side of the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.670
 group of four bringing it in the in 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.590
 left side of the group from three of the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.590
 our right side around 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.530
 now I'll show you some passages 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:44.690
 so to better understand the important 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.230
 cords that we move envelop 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.959
 always the biggest cord because 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.030
 then the final result will go like this a 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.030
 you will no longer see it covered 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.630
 this is this kind of intertwining you can 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.870
 make it with any kind of 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.110
 cordino the sun is nothing ford come 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.590
 I'm doing me or the super flashes 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.140
 ropes or other privileges and i 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.460
 cords like the waxed cord 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:28.230
 after codeine and you can of course 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:30.330
 use all the measurements you want 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.540
 always depends on four big networks 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540
 Braid 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.370
 then this will be our result 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.560
 final after several working cycles 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.990
 as you can see, in short, it is really a design 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.140
 particular and very original 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.890
 of course you can add beads 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.190
 or, in short, that of creating a 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.280
 cord so add a pendant 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.720
 in short, let your necklaces come 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.720
 extremely original 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.520
 then our technical video has 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.090
 terminated for any doubt and question 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.230
 you know that we are at your disposal 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.230
 a kiss to all bye
