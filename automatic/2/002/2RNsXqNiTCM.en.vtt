00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
for both sets of fans this game was only

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.250 
for both sets of fans this game was only
really<00:02:48.470> about<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.070> man<00:02:49.400> Gary<00:02:50.120> Megson<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.840> think

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
really about one man Gary Megson I think

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620 
really about one man Gary Megson I think
there's<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.470> bit<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:52.060> sort<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.120> hostile

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
there's a bit of a sort of hostile

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.930 
there's a bit of a sort of hostile
atmosphere<00:02:53.900> last<00:02:54.650> time<00:02:54.920> around<00:02:55.100> there<00:02:55.670> but<00:02:55.850> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
atmosphere last time around there but it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.250 
atmosphere last time around there but it
should<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.180> even<00:02:56.300> more<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> think<00:02:57.110> with

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
should be even more so I think with

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.990 
should be even more so I think with
their<00:02:57.560> management<00:02:58.010> standards<00:02:58.460> with<00:02:58.580> old<00:02:58.760> club

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
their management standards with old club
