00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
and then a really heavy crop the next

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160 
and then a really heavy crop the next

the<00:00:54.110> years<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:54.710> have<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:54.980> have<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.400> heavy

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
the years that you have you have a heavy

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.060 
the years that you have you have a heavy
crop<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.330> fruit<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:57.020> thin<00:00:57.350> off<00:00:57.560> some<00:00:57.860> of<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
crop of fruit to thin off some of the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.650 
crop of fruit to thin off some of the
apples<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:59.060> will<00:00:59.210> mean<00:00:59.330> that<00:00:59.390> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
apples and that will mean that the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.750 
apples and that will mean that the
apples<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.200> are<00:01:00.260> left<00:01:00.560> will<00:01:01.010> be<00:01:01.130> larger<00:01:01.610> and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
apples that are left will be larger and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.359 
apples that are left will be larger and
higher<00:01:02.060> quality<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.810> more<00:01:02.890> importantly<00:01:03.890> it

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
higher quality and more importantly it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.160 
higher quality and more importantly it
will<00:01:04.519> mean<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.150> tree<00:01:05.509> will<00:01:05.689> put<00:01:05.869> more<00:01:06.140> of

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
will mean that the tree will put more of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.440 
will mean that the tree will put more of
its<00:01:06.439> energy<00:01:06.680> into<00:01:07.220> producing<00:01:07.820> flower<00:01:08.060> buds

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
its energy into producing flower buds

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.410 
its energy into producing flower buds
for<00:01:09.079> next<00:01:09.110> year's<00:01:09.710> crop<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:10.670> then<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:11.270> does

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
for next year's crop and so then it does

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.179 
for next year's crop and so then it does
a<00:01:11.450> couple<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.869> things<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.409> not<00:01:12.560> only<00:01:12.680> helps<00:01:13.040> to

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
a couple of things and not only helps to

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.490 
a couple of things and not only helps to
improve<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.640> quality<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.119> this<00:01:14.659> year<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.380> it

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
improve the quality of this year but it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.889 
improve the quality of this year but it
also<00:01:15.649> helps<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.520> improve<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:17.270> quantity<00:01:17.600> of

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
also helps to improve the quantity of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.540 
also helps to improve the quantity of
fruit<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.229> you'll<00:01:18.560> get<00:01:18.740> next<00:01:19.070> year

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
fruit that you'll get next year

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.370 
fruit that you'll get next year
the<00:01:20.030> process<00:01:20.479> of<00:01:20.600> thinning<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.050> something

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
the process of thinning is something

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.980 
the process of thinning is something
that<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.710> is<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.070> pretty<00:01:22.760> easy<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.240> do<00:01:23.390> and

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
that is is a pretty easy to do and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.890 
that is is a pretty easy to do and
usually<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:24.800> occurs<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.430> about<00:01:25.900> mid-june

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
usually it occurs in about mid-june

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.789 
usually it occurs in about mid-june
through<00:01:27.640> early<00:01:28.640> July<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.390> we<00:01:30.170> usually<00:01:30.409> wait

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
through early July and we usually wait

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.520 
through early July and we usually wait
for<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:31.100> time<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.430> June<00:01:31.850> drop<00:01:32.240> into<00:01:32.900> Rapids<00:01:32.930> a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
for a time of June drop into Rapids a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.740 
for a time of June drop into Rapids a
time<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.979> summer<00:01:34.400> fruit<00:01:34.670> Angela<00:01:35.240> crops<00:01:35.510> from

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
the tree that has been pollinated

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.240 
the tree that has been pollinated
entirely<00:01:38.090> or<00:01:38.450> properly<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.680> wait<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.100> see

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
entirely or properly so you wait to see

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.219 
entirely or properly so you wait to see
some<00:01:40.460> apples<00:01:40.820> on<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.000> ground<00:01:41.330> under<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.930> tree

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
some apples on the ground under the tree

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.469 
some apples on the ground under the tree
and<00:01:42.620> once<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.159> walk<00:01:43.610> through<00:01:43.880> that<00:01:44.060> time<00:01:44.299> of

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
and once you walk through that time of

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.289 
and once you walk through that time of
June<00:01:44.720> drop<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.650> begin<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.010> decide<00:01:46.670> how

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
June drop then you begin to decide how

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.960 
June drop then you begin to decide how
to<00:01:47.330> how<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.869> thin<00:01:48.200> an<00:01:49.040> apple<00:01:49.400> tree<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.850> this

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
to how to thin an apple tree and in this

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.300 
to how to thin an apple tree and in this
case<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.510> always<00:01:51.140> start<00:01:51.409> by<00:01:51.440> saying<00:01:51.860> let's<00:01:52.100> do

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
case I always start by saying let's do

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.730 
case I always start by saying let's do
some<00:01:52.549> cluster<00:01:53.060> thinning<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.630> when<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.200> when<00:01:54.710> I

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
some cluster thinning and when I when I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.760 
some cluster thinning and when I when I
say<00:01:54.979> cluster<00:01:55.400> thinning<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:56.360> look<00:01:56.690> at<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> group

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
say cluster thinning I look at a group

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.960 
say cluster thinning I look at a group
of<00:01:57.950> apples<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.430> are<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.939> same

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
of apples that are all in the same

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.660 
of apples that are all in the same
cluster<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.900> I<00:02:00.200> take<00:02:00.619> them<00:02:00.799> all<00:02:01.010> off<00:02:01.220> except

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
cluster and I take them all off except

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.170 
cluster and I take them all off except
one<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.570> best<00:02:03.290> tool<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.640> use<00:02:04.939> for

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
one in the best tool that that I use for

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.789 
one in the best tool that that I use for
that<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.869> handy<00:02:06.229> it's<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:06.619> your

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
that is really handy it's just your

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.759 
that is really handy it's just your
thumbnail<00:02:07.310> then<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:07.880> simply<00:02:08.269> break<00:02:08.539> off<00:02:08.810> all

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
thumbnail then you simply break off all

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.000 
thumbnail then you simply break off all
will<00:02:10.069> put<00:02:10.189> the<00:02:10.310> largest<00:02:10.759> size<00:02:11.000> apple<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.010> put

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
will put the largest size apple and put

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.979 
will put the largest size apple and put
these<00:02:13.189> apples<00:02:13.730> into<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> bucket<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.629> put<00:02:14.870> them

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
these apples into a bucket and put them

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.080 
these apples into a bucket and put them
into<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> well<00:02:15.500> working<00:02:15.709> compost<00:02:16.250> pile<00:02:16.580> now

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
into a well working compost pile now

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.360 
into a well working compost pile now
this<00:02:17.360> Apple<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.900> left<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.439> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.040> grow

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
this Apple that is left is going to grow

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.339 
this Apple that is left is going to grow
larger<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.180> summer<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.900> higher-quality

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
larger this summer so higher-quality

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.020 
larger this summer so higher-quality
fruit<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.069> also<00:02:22.879> next<00:02:23.779> year<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.200> possibility

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
fruit and also next year the possibility

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.600 
fruit and also next year the possibility
of<00:02:25.090> forming<00:02:25.690> more<00:02:25.900> flower<00:02:26.260> buds<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.220> twig

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
of forming more flower buds on this twig

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.340 
of forming more flower buds on this twig
are<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.450> greater<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.900> you're<00:02:29.200> going

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
are going to be greater and you're going

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.070 
are going to be greater and you're going
to<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> higher<00:02:30.370> quality<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.480> quantity<00:02:31.810> of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
to have a higher quality and quantity of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.960 
to have a higher quality and quantity of
three<00:02:32.320> big<00:02:32.560> cheater<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.250> let's<00:02:33.430> move<00:02:33.610> up<00:02:33.820> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
three big cheater so let's move up the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
three big cheater so let's move up the
limb<00:02:34.150> now<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:34.960> doing<00:02:35.140> my<00:02:35.260> thinning<00:02:35.620> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
limb now as I'm doing my thinning I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.310 
limb now as I'm doing my thinning I
sometimes<00:02:36.520> see<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:38.110> some

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
sometimes see that that I have some

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.860 
sometimes see that that I have some
fruit<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.490> disease<00:02:40.090> or<00:02:40.420> insect

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fruit that is is that disease or insect

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.140 
fruit that is is that disease or insect
damaged<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.010> here's<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> fruit<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:42.940> some

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
damaged and here's a fruit with some

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.949 
damaged and here's a fruit with some
apple<00:02:43.450> scab

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
apple scab

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.750 
apple scab
so<00:02:44.200> there's<00:02:44.440> automatically<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.250> fruit<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.670> I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so there's automatically a fruit that I

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.940 
so there's automatically a fruit that I
would<00:02:45.940> take<00:02:46.090> off<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.560> thinning

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
would take off in this in this thinning

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.449 
would take off in this in this thinning
process

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
process

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.230 
process
here's<00:02:49.120> another<00:02:49.300> cluster<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:51.030> move<00:02:52.030> up

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
here's another cluster of to move up

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.090 
here's another cluster of to move up
single<00:02:53.020> single

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
single single

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.150 
single single
here's<00:02:54.520> another<00:02:54.700> cluster<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.770> three<00:02:56.770> apples

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
here's another cluster of three apples

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.280 
here's another cluster of three apples
and<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:58.000> again<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.300> have<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.630> little<00:02:58.989> bit<00:02:59.140> of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and in here again I have a little bit of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.100 
and in here again I have a little bit of
a<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.620> a<00:03:00.190> insect<00:03:00.670> injury<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.360> that's<00:03:01.540> an<00:03:01.750> apple

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
a of a insect injury so that's an apple

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.050 
a of a insect injury so that's an apple
that<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.590> would<00:03:02.800> again<00:03:03.010> snap<00:03:03.370> off<00:03:03.640> with<00:03:03.910> my

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that I would again snap off with my

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.410 
that I would again snap off with my
thumbnail<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:05.190> another<00:03:06.190> one<00:03:06.400> comes<00:03:06.670> off<00:03:06.910> so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
thumbnail and another one comes off so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.120 
thumbnail and another one comes off so
this<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.020> Apple<00:03:08.350> I'm<00:03:08.440> leaving<00:03:08.830> another

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is the Apple I'm leaving another

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.280 
this is the Apple I'm leaving another
question<00:03:09.670> right<00:03:09.820> here<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.390> take<00:03:10.750> them<00:03:10.930> all<00:03:11.080> off

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
question right here I take them all off

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.490 
question right here I take them all off
except<00:03:11.739> one<00:03:11.980> move<00:03:12.850> up<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.239> tree<00:03:13.420> take<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.350> off

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
except one move up the tree take it off

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.250 
except one move up the tree take it off
take<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.070> off<00:03:15.360> keep<00:03:16.360> moving<00:03:16.720> up<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.020> branch

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
take it off keep moving up the branch

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.350 
take it off keep moving up the branch
and<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.340> move<00:03:18.580> around<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.060> tree

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
and so as you move around the tree

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.210 
and so as you move around the tree
you're<00:03:19.840> going<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.110> find<00:03:20.320> lots<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.739> apples<00:03:20.950> that

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
you're going to find lots of apples that

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.949 
you're going to find lots of apples that
need<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.520> come<00:03:21.670> off<00:03:21.730> again<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.450> like<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
need to come off again I like to have a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.050 
need to come off again I like to have a
five<00:03:23.290> gallon<00:03:23.470> bucket<00:03:23.680> close<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.580> me<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:24.880> just

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
five gallon bucket close to me and just

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.240 
five gallon bucket close to me and just
drop<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.600> apples<00:03:26.350> into<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.620> bucket<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:31.540> that

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
drop the apples into a bucket in that

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.320 
drop the apples into a bucket in that
then<00:03:33.250> they<00:03:33.400> should<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.670> put<00:03:33.850> into<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.090> well

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
then they should be put into a well

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.140 
then they should be put into a well
working<00:03:34.540> compost<00:03:35.110> pile<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.680> they'll<00:03:36.280> return

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
working compost pile and they'll return

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.120 
working compost pile and they'll return
rate<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.870> pile<00:03:38.140> fairly<00:03:38.530> quickly<00:03:38.739> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
rate and that pile fairly quickly and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:48.680 
rate and that pile fairly quickly and
help<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.090> compost<00:03:40.540> as<00:03:40.750> well
