00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello in today's tutorial we're going to do 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.920
 a cork shaped like a cloud for you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.920
 desk 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.300
 The materials that you will need are 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.300
 carlton 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.870
 the cork mine 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.280
 pencil 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.280
 scissors or cutter 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.400
 glue 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.400
 and optional paint and brush 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.850
 first let's take the sheet of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 This cork measures about 3 millimeters of 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.370
 thick you use the one you get and the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.470
 size will be depending on how 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.380
 big you want the cork to be 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.450
 below with pencil draws a cloud 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.830
 making the most of possible space 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.830
 so that this one is great 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.579
 when it is already drawn trim if you use 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.219
 a thin sheet you can do it with a 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.219
 scissors if it is thick use a cutter 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.750
 Y 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 as you will see these accept final the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 go through the thumbtack to avoid this 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.830
 let's make a layer of cardboard 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.600
 Take the cardboard on top of the car and 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.310
 Mark your outline 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.310
 next cut what 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 ah 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.769
 when you have both pieces applied 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.769
 glue on the cardboard and stick the cork 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.709
 let it dry by putting something on it to 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.709
 that does not curve 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.820
 if you want you can decorate it by giving it a 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.210
 layer of paint but I'm going to leave it 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.210
 A) Yes 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
 and now you only have to hang it in the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.720
 site you want I'll stick it to the wall 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.120
 with a special ribbon 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.460
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.290
