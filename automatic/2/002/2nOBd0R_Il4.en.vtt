 New comedian 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 Let's name it to start producing projects 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.190
 Say Hirosaki producer smoked 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.140
 It's very new and new, but it's naming but it's 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.860
 I heard vegetables 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.860
 Ummm 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 After all, I now 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 The sound world of the media has changed significantly with this youtube at the center 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:35.969
 It 's similar to one performer ever appearing on TV 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 One thing or almost all that was the only technique I've concentrated on there 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:44.860
 Hey that way is no longer a father 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 Performers also have to launch new media and adjust to drums there 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.210
 That is why we are in the stage 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.100
 For such a situation 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.900
 Creator broadcaster 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.210
 Say whether the soccer bounce What can 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.600
 After all , I would like to make a river like this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.830
 Including up to be selfish to continue to create what kind of content So for the new media 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.569
 Have to think 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:17.090
 So I am also this youtube 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:20.170
 I'm trying through the program production of 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.200
 Friends or partners 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.990
 I started to sleep a project I want to invite 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.710

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.670
 New thing 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.260
 Challenge and sell 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.980
 That 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.010
 Something to do 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 Entered I think there is a feeling 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.200
 The entertainer came by all means Outside of the girl 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 Riding on 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.870
 I contact the e-mail address Yes 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.569
 I think if you get rid of this 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.379
 You wish 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.379
 That pattern is good because I was a documentary, but Nakayama is weak 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.030
 Well, I say this is the document of Nakayama director's growth 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.080
 I smell at my own fancy yourself Ninen Da'tsu 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.610
 It can Yes this is 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.810
 Successful or 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.350
 Entered Naa did not go perhaps well 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.819
 Musicians wanted to do it Oh 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.310
 # That's right 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.560
 Now 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.900
 Naa music industry more than comedy industry 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.750
 It's pretty hard and it's in a situation 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:37.490
 Everyone, I have no idea how I want to get out of the Meiji-chan talent 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.620
 But do not be out like 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:45.980
 I do not have an answer to such a situation, but something 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 I think that I want to do new work 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.560
 Incidentally hen also here now who of musicians Looks 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.350
 I will prepare 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.069
 9 minutes Is Yeah Nakayama is Shazam 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:02.210

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.760
 You wish 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.760
 I am the one who stopped the musician named Minamiyamado 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.290
 Do-y-me-ji 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.540
 Beneath use together 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.389
 Is it true that fx does not have a son in a raised race ? 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.110
 Hmm 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 No sleep after all 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.830
 I think people who can compose music are good 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.250
 I agree 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.849
 The number and Kano partner role of human Yes What if the musical instrument that can later be returned, or rather compose 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:44.260
 The idea of ​​the chorus 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:49.110
 If you can think of someone who can't get out of the world but want to do it together 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.110
 Saying now I still house I looper 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:03.470
 Use the voice to make a few different sounds and combine them for something 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.680
 I have a chance to make music 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.129

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.930
 It is already such a time 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.639
 That's right 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.360

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:42.349
 Even boys can be
