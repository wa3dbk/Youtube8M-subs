be able to put hours of practice in some

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.850 
be able to put hours of practice in some
of<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:06.390> games<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> seeing<00:01:07.680> myself

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
of these games and seeing myself

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
of these games and seeing myself
progress<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.549> even<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> limited<00:01:09.210> time

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
progress and even in the limited time

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
progress and even in the limited time
that<00:01:09.659> I've<00:01:09.960> had<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.290> them<00:01:10.439> already<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that I've had with them already I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
that I've had with them already I
certainly<00:01:11.760> felt<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:12.720> got

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
certainly felt like I've actually got

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.450 
certainly felt like I've actually got
better<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.619> some<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:13.890> activities

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
better at some of these activities

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.690 
better at some of these activities
because<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.450> Xbox<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.140> Kinect<00:01:16.500> sensor<00:01:17.400> was

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
because the Xbox one Kinect sensor was

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
because the Xbox one Kinect sensor was
actually<00:01:18.030> reading<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.750> body<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.200> more

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
actually reading my body much more

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
actually reading my body much more
accurately<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.950> first<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:20.759> see

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
accurately so first of all it could see

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.399 
accurately so first of all it could see
where<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.180> standing<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.840> could<00:01:22.110> recognize

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
where I was standing it could recognize

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
where I was standing it could recognize
it<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:22.920> without<00:01:23.220> biometric<00:01:23.790> sign-in<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
it was me without biometric sign-in and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.109 
it was me without biometric sign-in and
also<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.130> hand<00:01:26.580> whether

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
also it could see with my hand whether

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
also it could see with my hand whether
it<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> open<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.689> closed<00:01:27.960> within<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.799> whole

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it is open or closed within a whole

shooting<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.239> really<00:03:28.420> interesting<00:03:28.900> addition

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230

here on Kinect Sports rivals lots of
games<00:03:31.390> previously<00:03:32.110> tried<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.770> do<00:03:32.890> those

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
shooting controls with Kinect but I'm

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.780 
shooting controls with Kinect but I'm
hoping<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> Xbox<00:03:36.040> one<00:03:36.250> controls<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
hoping that the Xbox one controls and

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.210 
hoping that the Xbox one controls and
that<00:03:36.910> greater<00:03:37.270> fidelity<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:38.260> what<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.830> can<00:03:38.950> see

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that greater fidelity of what it can see

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.979 
that greater fidelity of what it can see
will<00:03:39.580> mean<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:39.880> have<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> proper<00:03:40.420> really

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
will mean that we have a proper really

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.170 
will mean that we have a proper really
nice<00:03:41.170> hands-free<00:03:41.800> experience<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.550> shooting

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
nice hands-free experience of shooting

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.780 
nice hands-free experience of shooting
and<00:03:43.570> target<00:03:44.080> practice<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:45.010> Kinect<00:03:45.340> sensor<00:03:45.430> is

the controller tennis - it seems the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
footage here would suggest that there's

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.570 
footage here would suggest that there's
more<00:03:52.959> movement<00:03:53.140> around<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> court<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.160> that

more movement around the court and that

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.280 
more movement around the court and that
you've<00:03:54.730> got<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.880> greater<00:03:55.270> selection<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.989> shots

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
you've got a greater selection of shots

you've got a greater selection of shots

stood in the right direction to get

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.570 
stood in the right direction to get
yourself<00:04:02.320> lined<00:04:02.530> up<00:04:02.739> for<00:04:02.920> shots<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.340> really

follow through and get maximum power

follow through and get maximum power
bowling<00:04:06.010> again<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.280> think<00:04:06.340> that's<00:04:06.580> just<00:04:06.670> maybe

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
bowling again I think that's just maybe

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.910 
bowling again I think that's just maybe
a<00:04:07.150> sort<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.540> stock<00:04:08.019> favorite<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.739> just

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
a sort of a stock favorite that is just

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.970 
a sort of a stock favorite that is just
returning<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:10.600> bowling<00:04:11.050> success<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.709> the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
returning that bowling success on the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.710 
returning that bowling success on the
way<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.310> course<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:13.090> that's<00:04:13.269> hard<00:04:13.570> to

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
way of course is one that's hard to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.330 
way of course is one that's hard to
ignore<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.500> here<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.739> like<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.100> way<00:04:15.190> that

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
ignore but here I like the way that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.890 
ignore but here I like the way that
again<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.880> is<00:04:15.940> body<00:04:16.180> position<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
again it is body position and

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.819 
again it is body position and
follow-through<00:04:17.770> and<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.460> whole

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
follow-through and that whole

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.559 
follow-through and that whole
all<00:04:18.919> weeding<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.639> your<00:04:19.789> skeleton<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.449> make

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:20.569 
all weeding of your skeleton to make

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.020 
all weeding of your skeleton to make
sure<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.870> you've<00:04:21.079> bowled<00:04:21.409> that<00:04:21.590> bowl

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
sure that you've bowled that bowl

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.820 
sure that you've bowled that bowl
accurately<00:04:23.030> down<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.569> lane<00:04:23.750> now<00:04:24.379> first<00:04:24.650> time

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
accurately down the lane now first time

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.439 
accurately down the lane now first time
we<00:04:24.949> go<00:04:25.069> to<00:04:25.129> her<00:04:25.280> clothes<00:04:25.669> look<00:04:25.909> at<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.150> soccer

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
we go to her clothes look at the soccer

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.659 
we go to her clothes look at the soccer

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
game here in Kinect Sports rivals and I

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.010 
game here in Kinect Sports rivals and I
like<00:04:28.969> the<00:04:29.090> way<00:04:29.210> there<00:04:29.360> seems<00:04:29.509> to<00:04:29.569> be<00:04:29.629> much<00:04:29.810> more

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
like the way there seems to be much more

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.499 
like the way there seems to be much more
choice<00:04:30.319> and<00:04:30.680> much<00:04:30.979> more<00:04:31.189> control<00:04:31.669> over<00:04:32.270> how

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
choice and much more control over how

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.730 
choice and much more control over how
you<00:04:32.569> play<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.960> game<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.229> can<00:04:33.379> see<00:04:33.500> here

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
you play the game you can see here

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.439 
you play the game you can see here
passing<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.520> from<00:04:34.699> player<00:04:34.909> to<00:04:35.060> play<00:04:35.240> and

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
passing it from player to play and

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.170 
passing it from player to play and
choosing<00:04:36.080> when<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.680> take<00:04:36.949> your<00:04:37.159> shot<00:04:37.400> again

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
choosing when to take your shot again

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.119

similar<00:04:38.599> maybe<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.110> their<00:04:39.259> old<00:04:39.439> Kinect<00:04:39.860> sports

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
game there my hope is that I'll do

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.080 
game there my hope is that I'll do
better<00:04:42.319> against<00:04:42.979> my<00:04:43.129> six-year-old<00:04:43.669> who<00:04:43.819> by

to usually beat me it's gonna be that

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.350
