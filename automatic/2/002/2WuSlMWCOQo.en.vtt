00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 so the winfried kasimir does not have 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.599
 has written asked what is because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:19.810
 actually the alm metal mode at xp 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.279
 deos and another still ask the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.080
 What is that? 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.880
 attitude what causes the now 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.730
 audio saturation is nothing in the end 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.449
 If you are a very big object 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.680
 and then the school has the ad 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.550
 tonya very much distorted and this car 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.829
 Saturation this setting 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.809
 the higher you set the stronger 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.239
 is this distortion that actually 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.260
 all that is really just there and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 large or very close objects 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.989
 to recognize on the surface 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.039
 So very simple actually that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.019
 Attitude is in the original has 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.390
 manual also not further explained 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.659
 but that's just great for that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.189
 travel objects especially iron objects 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.290
 stronger on the surface 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.610
 to display with a really fierce 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.070
 consumed sound 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.840
 that proves that is a very big one 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.790
 object so the next the next thing 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.710
 he asked me what's up 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.280
 completely with the old metal mode 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.470
 easy in normal mode runs me 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.100
 do you go with one with any one? 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.740
 discriminate mode or with any 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.509
 attitude to discrimination and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.460
 Here I have set 50 more 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.200
 here i have my iron ball and if 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 I will give the Schwenke before the detector 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 it just a pretty low buzzer 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.810
 and that is in hennef act the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.400
 Discrimination for travel just 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.210
 to get there just iron from others 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.420
 to recognize metals 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.400
 in all metal mode the is in 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.820
 the final result is nothing more than the disc on 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.820
 to zero 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.600
 that's 0 and then iron has too 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.600
 Positive a good signal 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.060
 the iron ball gives then also in the high 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.000
 I will then sound the sound then I will 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.190
 no place this tone sets me 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 if I am here at disc in the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.810
 expert mode go three ton then have 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.620
 but now I second because the first tone 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.570
 that is active only if I the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.670
 turn on disk with 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.519
 Now I have to say I 'm in the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.829
 3d mode but i have without the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.610
 I have only one discrimination 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.670
 second mode on how to see the 200th 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.870
 hertz this deep sound for traveling 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.299
 it is now complete 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.150
 turned off and you can see it too 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:19.329
 the frequency 50hertz cushioning I have 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.220
 that is then that gives then all signals 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:26.079
 of itself in this frequency between 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.760
 a lending value of 0 to 65 that 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.100
 The 3d mode is called quasi 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.590
 automatic second mode switched 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.280
 and that means in the end the alm 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.269
 Metal mode I now have a value of 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.730
 2 yet displayed this iron ball 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.799
 a high tone 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.959
 that's actually the whole secret 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.660
 hold as he is called in the metal mode 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.910
 the end result is nothing more than that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.730
 set discrimination to zero 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.720
 that was it all already clear 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.320
 bye for now 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.320
 bye
