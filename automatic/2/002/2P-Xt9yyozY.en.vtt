welcome<00:00:13.049> back<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.740> last<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.280> removed<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
welcome back so last time I removed the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.269 
welcome back so last time I removed the
dash<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.719> exposed<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> wiring<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
dash which exposed all of the wiring and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
dash which exposed all of the wiring and
the<00:00:17.430> heater<00:00:17.640> coat<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:18.510> already<00:00:18.900> removed

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the heater coat now I've already removed

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320 
the heater coat now I've already removed
a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> wiring<00:00:20.310> first<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.000> removed

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
a lot of the wiring first I removed

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.480 
a lot of the wiring first I removed
every<00:00:21.810> fuse<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> fuse<00:00:22.590> box<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.189> didn't

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
every fuse of the fuse box that didn't

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.279 
every fuse of the fuse box that didn't
affect<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> function<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> inch<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
affect the function of the inch then I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.589 
affect the function of the inch then I
simply<00:00:25.710> unplug<00:00:26.160> connectors<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.880> by<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
simply unplug connectors one by one it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
simply unplug connectors one by one it
started<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> car<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> ensure<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> would

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
started the car to ensure that it would

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
started the car to ensure that it would
remain<00:00:29.699> running<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.630> traced<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> wires

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
remain running then I traced the wires

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.190 
remain running then I traced the wires
back<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> origin<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.489> come<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> wrap<00:00:33.989> him

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
back to the origin to come and wrap him

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.049 
back to the origin to come and wrap him
up<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.860> did<00:00:35.100> run<00:00:35.280> into<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> few<00:00:35.790> connections

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
up now I did run into a few connections

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.139 
up now I did run into a few connections
that<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:37.050> kill<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.290> engine<00:00:37.710> when

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
that would kill the engine when

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.580 
that would kill the engine when
disconnected<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.200> bypass

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
disconnected some of which I will bypass

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280 
disconnected some of which I will bypass
once<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.340> install<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.820> switch<00:00:42.059> box<00:00:42.300> since<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
once I install the switch box since this

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
once I install the switch box since this
is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> fuel-injected<00:00:44.460> car<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.210> has<00:00:45.450> computer

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
is a fuel-injected car it has computer

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
is a fuel-injected car it has computer
and<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> vital<00:00:46.860> components<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.879> are

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and a lot of vital components that are

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
and a lot of vital components that are
vital<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> function<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> engine<00:00:50.129> if

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
vital to the function of the engine if

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
vital to the function of the engine if
it's<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.850> older<00:00:51.210> car<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> its<00:00:51.840> carbureted

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
it's an older car and its carbureted

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's an older car and its carbureted
then<00:00:53.340> most<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> wiring<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.600> able<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
then most of the wiring will be able to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.130 
then most of the wiring will be able to
be<00:00:55.050> bypassed<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.840> I'll<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
be bypassed if not all but I'll have to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.900 
be bypassed if not all but I'll have to
show<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.160> car<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
show you that on a different car so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
show you that on a different car so
let's<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> heater<00:01:00.750> core<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
let's get this heater core out of here

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
let's get this heater core out of here
now<00:01:01.890> last<00:01:02.190> year<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> showed<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> how<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
now last year I showed you how to do it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.620 
now last year I showed you how to do it
with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> sledgehammer<00:01:04.970> this<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.540> gonna

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
with a sledgehammer this time I'm gonna

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.539 
with a sledgehammer this time I'm gonna
have<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> show<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.189> right

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
have to show you how to do it the right

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.420 
have to show you how to do it the right
way<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.780> say<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.590> let's<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.950> started

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
way so they say so let's get started

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730 
way so they say so let's get started
okay<00:01:11.689> now<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.840> typical<00:01:13.080> heater<00:01:13.470> core

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
okay now your typical heater core

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
okay now your typical heater core
normally<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.400> six<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> eight<00:01:15.180> bolts<00:01:15.659> holding

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
normally has six to eight bolts holding

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960 
normally has six to eight bolts holding
it<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.860> most<00:01:17.040> cases<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.610> bolts<00:01:17.880> are

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it in and in most cases the bolts are

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
it in and in most cases the bolts are
accessible<00:01:18.570> from<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> inside<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> engine

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
accessible from the inside of the engine

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
accessible from the inside of the engine
compartment<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> case<00:01:21.689> they're

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
compartment but in this case they're

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.010 
compartment but in this case they're
inside<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> car<00:01:22.890> -<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.939> each<00:01:23.970> side<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
inside the car - up top on each side and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
inside the car - up top on each side and
two<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> bottom<00:01:25.710> after<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> remove<00:01:26.820> those

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
two at the bottom after you remove those

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.749 
two at the bottom after you remove those
bolts<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:28.110> gonna<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.530> four<00:01:28.829> hoses<00:01:29.310> two<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
bolts there's gonna be four hoses two of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
bolts there's gonna be four hoses two of
them<00:01:29.939> are<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> water<00:01:30.390> feed<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> return<00:01:31.229> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
them are the water feed in return and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
them are the water feed in return and
the<00:01:31.650> other<00:01:31.799> two<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> air

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the other two are for the air

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
the other two are for the air
conditioning<00:01:33.060> unit<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.140> you

for a little bit of water inside your

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
for a little bit of water inside your
car<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.520> no<00:01:38.670> big<00:01:38.850> deal<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.180> no<00:01:39.390> harm<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
car it's no big deal it's no harm so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.370 
car it's no big deal it's no harm so
let's<00:01:40.229> start<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.719 

okay<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.440> I've<00:01:47.710> already<00:01:47.979> undone<00:01:48.400> all<00:01:48.610> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
okay so I've already undone all the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.880 
okay so I've already undone all the
bolts<00:01:49.150> now<00:01:49.810> all<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.050> have<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.260> do<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.590> go<00:01:50.740> into

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
bolts now all I have to do is go into

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.800 
bolts now all I have to do is go into
the<00:01:51.100> engine<00:01:51.430> compartment<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.970> discharge<00:01:52.570> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the engine compartment and discharge the

remove<00:03:56.250> I'm<00:03:56.939> in<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.049> cars<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.319> rivet<00:03:58.769> it

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
remove I'm in a lot of cars to rivet it

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.940 
remove I'm in a lot of cars to rivet it
in<00:03:58.980> place<00:03:59.280> and<00:04:00.230> you'll<00:04:01.230> have<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.500> grind<00:04:01.709> off

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
in place and you'll have to grind off

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.759 
in place and you'll have to grind off
the<00:04:02.099> rivets<00:04:02.459> or<00:04:02.730> drill<00:04:03.450> them<00:04:03.569> out<00:04:03.659> I<00:04:04.049> think<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
the rivets or drill them out I think the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.550 
the rivets or drill them out I think the
best<00:04:04.950> way<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:06.329> just<00:04:06.689> get<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> torch<00:04:07.230> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
best way is to just get the torch and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.170 
best way is to just get the torch and
and<00:04:07.859> they<00:04:08.159> just<00:04:08.400> melt<00:04:08.609> out<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.939> there<00:04:09.060> you

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and they just melt out of there you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.309 
and they just melt out of there you
don't<00:04:09.299> even<00:04:09.419> have<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.659> do<00:04:09.750> any<00:04:09.930> cutting<00:04:10.079> or

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
don't even have to do any cutting or

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.599 
don't even have to do any cutting or
anything<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:10.889> heat<00:04:11.069> them<00:04:11.129> up<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.489> they'll

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
anything just heat them up and they'll

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.349 
anything just heat them up and they'll
melt<00:04:11.790> away<00:04:11.969> and<00:04:12.239> everything<00:04:12.900> falls<00:04:13.200> out

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
melt away and everything falls out

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.210 
melt away and everything falls out
you're<00:04:15.359> done<00:04:15.599> I'm<00:04:16.470> not<00:04:16.530> even<00:04:16.680> going<00:04:17.039> to<00:04:17.070> waste

out of here I want to show you one last

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.050 
out of here I want to show you one last
technique<00:04:28.260> now<00:04:29.099> I<00:04:29.130> normally<00:04:29.310> don't<00:04:29.760> approve

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
technique now I normally don't approve

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.480 
technique now I normally don't approve
this<00:04:30.389> type<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.659> technique<00:04:31.110> because<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.740> don't

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
this type of technique because I don't

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.730 
this type of technique because I don't
like<00:04:32.639> messy<00:04:32.940> garage<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:34.289> don't<00:04:34.349> like<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
like messy garage and I don't like the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.550 
like messy garage and I don't like the
extra<00:04:35.070> work<00:04:35.310> but<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.120> haven't<00:04:36.780> Galia<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
extra work but I haven't Galia and I

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.279 
extra work but I haven't Galia and I
told<00:04:37.949> me<00:04:38.099> a<00:04:38.270> trick<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.780> wanna<00:04:40.020> give<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.229> a

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
told me a trick and I wanna give it a

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:40.700 
told me a trick and I wanna give it a
shot

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
shot

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.770 
shot
I've<00:04:41.099> never<00:04:41.280> tried<00:04:41.580> before<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.449> hear<00:04:42.690> it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
I've never tried before and I hear it

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.170 
I've never tried before and I hear it
works<00:04:43.080> now<00:04:43.530> what<00:04:44.250> he<00:04:44.340> says<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.729> do<00:04:44.849> is<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:45.060> take

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
works now what he says to do is to take

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.600 
works now what he says to do is to take
spark<00:04:45.570> plug<00:04:45.889> smashing<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.949> little<00:04:47.220> bit<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.520> you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
spark plug smashing a little bit so you

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.640 
spark plug smashing a little bit so you
take<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.849> little<00:04:48.150> tiny<00:04:48.330> piece<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.050> porcelain

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
take a little tiny piece of porcelain

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.439 
take a little tiny piece of porcelain
and<00:04:50.010> then<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.430> can<00:04:50.610> just<00:04:50.820> toss<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.270> at<00:04:51.389> the

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
and then you can just toss it at the

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.020 
and then you can just toss it at the
glass<00:04:51.659> and<00:04:52.169> it'll<00:04:52.830> shatter<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.310> sounds<00:04:53.880> like<00:04:54.000> a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
glass and it'll shatter it sounds like a

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.879 
glass and it'll shatter it sounds like a
pretty<00:04:54.240> cool<00:04:54.419> trick<00:04:54.599> for<00:04:54.720> work<00:04:55.080> son<00:04:55.409> but

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
pretty cool trick for work son but

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.890 
pretty cool trick for work son but
really<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.520> think<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.880> best<00:04:57.060> way<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.300> do<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.720> is

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
really I think the best way to do it is

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.350 
really I think the best way to do it is
just<00:04:58.409> take<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.370> out<00:04:59.490> without<00:04:59.639> breaking<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.330> and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
just take it out without breaking it and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.659 
just take it out without breaking it and
save<00:05:00.659> yourself<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.229> hassle<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.800> getting<00:05:02.460> out

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
save yourself the hassle of getting out

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.100 
save yourself the hassle of getting out
the<00:05:02.759> shop<00:05:02.970> back<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.479> cleaning<00:05:03.750> up<00:05:03.840> all<00:05:03.990> the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
the shop back and cleaning up all the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.379 
the shop back and cleaning up all the
glass<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.710> maybe<00:05:05.280> then<00:05:05.550> cutting<00:05:05.849> yourself<00:05:06.210> up

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
glass and maybe then cutting yourself up

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.159 
glass and maybe then cutting yourself up
a<00:05:06.509> little<00:05:06.659> bit<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.530> first<00:05:07.770> things<00:05:08.009> first

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
a little bit so first things first

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.080 
a little bit so first things first
gotta<00:05:10.169> get<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.409> safety<00:05:10.620> glasses<00:05:10.949> on<00:05:11.310> because

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
gotta get the safety glasses on because

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.520 
gotta get the safety glasses on because
I<00:05:12.240> don't<00:05:12.419> know<00:05:12.539> how<00:05:12.690> this<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:12.990> gonna<00:05:13.080> go<00:05:13.289> down
