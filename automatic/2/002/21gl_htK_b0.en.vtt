 and yes we have here we have here 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 that was it event the whole is called 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.460
 collect and win 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.539
 the whole is red-white a bicolor 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.830
 and we look at it that's one 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.269
 very aggressive thinks I can 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.960
 already in advance say very creatures 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.250
 Let yourself go a low turn 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.309
 and yes we'll see all this here 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 directly to the cube here again 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.800
 I think I have a 15 here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.989
 cards is sideboard so something about that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 to vary deck between games 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.180
 only at the event 6 because they 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.710
 you want to see exactly that again you can 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 Watch with you against the black jack 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 This is how we look at it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 main work on cards trainer sideboard 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 and optics to separate the two 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.039
 brochures, as always, how to play magic 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 and then collect and win here 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.620
 Prospect to the way but the whole 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 The information is here on the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 channel and in the video and should that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780
 first times that hauptacts look at that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 That's what we love most 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.680
 the mana base is interested in the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.830
 country that I do anticipate ever get out 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.490
 because this is not quite the case here 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 important briefly set the non-standard 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 countries ago we have three drill skillen 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.040
 inputs and the slightly better version 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 the dual countries the fans are watching 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 flood coming to the battlefield tapped game 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.780
 as long as a mountain or a plain 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.850
 controls very well 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 and then a fortress of the monster 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 twitter for two painters 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.909
 violation plus two plus two 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.799
 alertness at plus zero which at least 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.439
 is also very nice the rest 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.840
 standard countries now comes 90 times that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 main deck itself as I said that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.439
 Dekker the right low curve 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.579
 pretty aggressive builds a 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.350
 bit part on the new 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.140
 ability of boris is also or the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.119
 Borussia region it is the stock market 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.579
 offers a total of four times in advance 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.750
 available in play time for one 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.729
 painter and when with two others 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 picking up a horse is just this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.930
 Tellian key skill when you are with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 200 returns from a pixi plus two plus 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.289
 two to the end of the train 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.879
 then you still fall so perret or 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.129
 champion of the sprengels also a very 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.480
 strong man for 111 whenever others 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.209
 come into play under a tuber 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.180
 end of war +11 brand probably the best 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.190
 first dog four times the doomed 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 also travel very well when he dies 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.900
 because there is a 1 1 reject 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.459
 spiritual with flying a few 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 other criteria creatures with 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.299
 Criteria can affect the creatures 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.780
 he can not block that 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.269
 really completely designed for battery 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.970
 aspect lightning weimar bound with halls 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.319
 he gets and another culture hurry 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.019
 Thalia also a really nice card 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.910
 also cheap for 221 do not strike for 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.950
 But we cost more when working 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.780
 this work is almost only educated 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.250
 by too, so that's really good at 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.769
 almost only the spells of the opponent more 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.860
 Mana may cost you loud to German the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.090
 African women for 222 first violin and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.349
 as if that was not enough forever 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.750
 if I cast a spell again from the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.599
 Friedhof is doing three harms to this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.519
 players made valid still on board as 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.160
 two men two creature with the two 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.319
 perfect so solid cards 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.329
 Here are a lot of server blades 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.190
 paladin for three times two souls 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.170
 he found himself and the creature that 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.269
 connects get double beat so too 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.310
 really strong citigroup 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.079
 alternatively we have a flying one 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.829
 creatures in the three painters ready and 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.849
 make spark guardsmen of the company 61 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.349
 Dream picture to take damage 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.209
 advantages and at the beginning of the next 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.459
 sequence of their sacrifices so the through 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.290
 optimally the last years by look 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.060
 the couple spells on bm four times piller of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.180
 flame the flame pillar shoots two 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.349
 damage to a concrete or a player 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.060
 If you kill the creature, it kills you 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.799
 not the peace of max in exile 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.200
 especially good at your creature 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.970
 Nobody at the moment is very often 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.790
 sing a pretty solid g2 burns world 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.720
 the game shoots three damage 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.730
 There are a lot of people here 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.349
 Collecting tokens with the citizens 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.569
 two in number with fate hour 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.099
 even five days is just not happening 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.620
 but quite as often with the champion on 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.419
 the shooting is really good and a card 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.519
 name finally the probably coolest card 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.049
 read here because twice the post 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.139
 and he really really right 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.700
 really good for two painters you can 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.470
 you 1 off and who harm a lot to the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.500
 head right all yours 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.200
 creatures or 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.910
 cards of the bow support that too 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.670
 really strong protection formats of 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.870
 google that's exactly what 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.640
 annoying creatures that would like to have or 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.800
 a chain was war double hitting up 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.660
 at the end of the turn that is really strong 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.280
 with the company, go to normal here 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.530
 back as for example the spark 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.790
 hottest double- handed with twelve 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.280
 Damage pushes through with life 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.320
 Link really cool combination 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.300
 So the robot arm here concluding 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.390
 still a really cool card that 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.380
 whole bossi if this is nice again 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.480
