run<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> program<00:01:19.549> let's<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:20.970> does

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.210 

now<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.110> you've<00:01:30.290> seen<00:01:30.320> how<00:01:30.680> easy<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.160> to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
now that you've seen how easy it is to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.730 
now that you've seen how easy it is to
control<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.880> robot<00:01:32.060> let's<00:01:33.050> change<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
control the robot let's change the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.830 
control the robot let's change the
program<00:01:33.970> we're<00:01:34.970> going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.150> change<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.630> third

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
program we're going to change the third

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.190 
program we're going to change the third
line<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.500> did<00:01:36.800> say<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.820> drive<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.270> motors<00:01:38.630> fast

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
line it did say to drive the motors fast

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.190 
line it did say to drive the motors fast
and<00:01:39.590> fast<00:01:39.920> we're<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.030> going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> make<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.750> fast

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and fast we're now going to make it fast

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.950 
and fast we're now going to make it fast
and<00:01:42.560> slow<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.880> slowing<00:01:44.330> down<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.690> right

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
and slow that is slowing down the right

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.050 
and slow that is slowing down the right
wheel<00:01:45.290> let's<00:01:45.950> watch<00:01:46.190> what<00:01:46.430> happens<00:01:51.850> now<00:01:52.850> that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
wheel let's watch what happens now that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.820 
wheel let's watch what happens now that
we've<00:01:53.210> seen<00:01:53.450> how<00:01:53.570> easy<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.170> control<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
we've seen how easy it is to control the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.520 
we've seen how easy it is to control the
robot<00:01:55.210> let's<00:01:56.210> change<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.780> third<00:01:56.990> line<00:01:57.170> again

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
robot let's change the third line again

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.500 
robot let's change the third line again
this<00:01:58.070> time<00:01:58.370> we'll<00:01:58.700> make<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.000> right<00:01:59.270> wheel

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
this time we'll make the right wheel

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:09.340 
this time we'll make the right wheel
move<00:01:59.810> faster<00:02:00.350> than<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.100> left<00:02:01.340> wheel<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:08.350> both

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
move faster than the left wheel in both

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.100 
move faster than the left wheel in both
of<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.649> previous<00:02:09.800> examples<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.730> were<00:02:11.540> making

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
of the previous examples we were making

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.370 
of the previous examples we were making
one<00:02:12.320> mother<00:02:12.530> go<00:02:12.770> fast<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.400> one<00:02:13.640> goes<00:02:13.850> slow<00:02:14.380> in

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
one mother go fast and one goes slow in

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.920 
one mother go fast and one goes slow in
this<00:02:15.530> example<00:02:15.770> let's<00:02:16.310> stop<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.450> right<00:02:17.630> motor

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
this example let's stop the right motor

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.860 
this example let's stop the right motor
completely<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.700> makes<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.030> very<00:02:20.300> fast

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
completely so that it makes a very fast

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:31.600 
completely so that it makes a very fast
turn<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:29.500> let's<00:02:30.500> look<00:02:30.710> now<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.040> how

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
turn to the right let's look now at how

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.340 
turn to the right let's look now at how
these<00:02:31.820> simple<00:02:32.209> commands<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:32.959> something

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
these simple commands can do something

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.640 
these simple commands can do something
interesting<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:34.850> this<00:02:35.060> program<00:02:35.540> will<00:02:36.380> again

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
interesting in this program will again

now<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.859> this<00:03:15.010> way<00:03:15.250> case<00:03:15.989> since<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.109> robot<00:03:17.530> is

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
now in this way case since the robot is

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.520 
now in this way case since the robot is
making<00:03:18.099> very<00:03:18.340> slow<00:03:18.459> turns<00:03:19.109> you'll<00:03:20.109> be<00:03:20.319> able<00:03:20.379> to

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
making very slow turns you'll be able to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.830 
making very slow turns you'll be able to
follow<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.980> line<00:03:21.189> unless<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.939> gets<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.390> very

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
sharp turn in the line let's watch it

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:39.629 
sharp turn in the line let's watch it
and<00:03:25.810> see<00:03:26.019> what<00:03:26.170> happens<00:03:37.829> in<00:03:38.829> order<00:03:39.159> to<00:03:39.310> prevent

and see what happens in order to prevent
a<00:03:39.790> robot<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.329> losing<00:03:40.719> the<00:03:40.840> line<00:03:41.310> let's<00:03:42.310> make

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
a robot from losing the line let's make

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.809 
a robot from losing the line let's make
it<00:03:42.549> make<00:03:42.909> faster<00:03:43.629> turns<00:03:44.250> noticed<00:03:45.250> inside<00:03:45.639> the

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
it make faster turns noticed inside the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.960 
it make faster turns noticed inside the
loop<00:03:45.970> now<00:03:46.720> we're<00:03:46.959> using<00:03:47.200> fast<00:03:47.769> stop<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.639> stop

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
loop now we're using fast stop and stop

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.080 
loop now we're using fast stop and stop
fast<00:03:49.299> instead<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.109> slow<00:03:50.579> since<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.730> robot

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
fast instead of the slow since the robot

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.449 
fast instead of the slow since the robot
will<00:03:52.569> make<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> very<00:03:53.079> quick<00:03:53.409> turn<00:03:53.739> back<00:03:54.129> towards

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
will make a very quick turn back towards

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.539 
will make a very quick turn back towards
the<00:03:54.669> line<00:03:55.319> or<00:03:56.319> back<00:03:56.620> away<00:03:57.040> from<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.310> line

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
the line or back away from the line

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.170 
the line or back away from the line
depending<00:03:58.329> on<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:59.079> value<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.560> this<00:03:59.680> tensor

depending on the value of this tensor

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.390 
depending on the value of this tensor
let's<00:04:01.180> see<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.659> in<00:04:01.750> action<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.859> robot<00:04:03.250> will

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
let's see it in action the robot will

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.890 
let's see it in action the robot will
wobble<00:04:03.639> a<00:04:03.909> little<00:04:03.939> bit<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.480> time<00:04:04.540> because

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
wobble a little bit this time because

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.530 
wobble a little bit this time because
it's<00:04:05.230> making<00:04:05.590> very<00:04:05.829> quick<00:04:06.099> turns<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:07.239> you

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
it's making very quick turns but you

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.280 
it's making very quick turns but you
will<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.139> lose<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.680> line<00:04:12.870> notice<00:04:13.870> how<00:04:14.049> wobbly

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
will not lose the line notice how wobbly

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.370 
will not lose the line notice how wobbly
the<00:04:14.620> robot<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.299> we<00:04:16.299> could<00:04:16.509> solve<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:17.079> by

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
the robot is we could solve this by

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.339 
the robot is we could solve this by
changing<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:18.190> speeds<00:04:18.659> or<00:04:19.659> even<00:04:19.989> by<00:04:20.109> using

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
changing the speeds or even by using

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.070 
changing the speeds or even by using
multiple<00:04:20.949> sensors<00:04:21.539> remember<00:04:22.539> we<00:04:22.690> have<00:04:22.840> three

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
multiple sensors remember we have three

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.080 
multiple sensors remember we have three
line<00:04:23.289> sensors<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:23.919> front<00:04:24.280> if<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.669> used<00:04:24.880> all

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
line sensors on the front if we used all

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.350 
line sensors on the front if we used all
three<00:04:25.479> we'd<00:04:26.289> be<00:04:26.440> able<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.099> robot

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
three we'd be able to have the robot

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.689 
three we'd be able to have the robot
turn<00:04:28.360> faster<00:04:29.020> when<00:04:29.289> it's<00:04:29.440> starting<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.490> lose

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
turn faster when it's starting to lose

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.830 
turn faster when it's starting to lose
the<00:04:30.880> line<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.710> turn<00:04:32.710> slower<00:04:33.570> where<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.659> line

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the line and turn slower where the line

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:48.200 
the line and turn slower where the line
is<00:04:34.870> moving<00:04:35.080> fairly<00:04:35.710> smoothly
