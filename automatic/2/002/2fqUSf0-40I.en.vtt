slot so they're a really good option if
you're<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.379> using<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.710> graphics<00:00:47.250> card<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you're only using one graphics card I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
you're only using one graphics card I
know<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> one

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
know a lot of you are on these and one

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
know a lot of you are on these and one
graphics<00:00:49.469> card<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> said<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.460> good

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
graphics card so like I said very good

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
graphics card so like I said very good
way<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.879> let's<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> tour<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.320> one

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
way to go let's take a tour of this one

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
way to go let's take a tour of this one
so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.160> start<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> envision<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.840> system

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so you can start to envision your system

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.180 
so you can start to envision your system
alright<00:00:55.829> right<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.770> 775<00:00:58.770> socket

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
alright right here that's the 775 socket

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
alright right here that's the 775 socket
that's<00:00:59.640> where<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> install<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.539> quad<00:01:00.989> core

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's where you install your quad core

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
that's where you install your quad core
your<00:01:01.469> core<00:01:01.649> 2<00:01:01.800> duo<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.850> notice<00:01:03.059> around

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
your core 2 duo and if you notice around

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
your core 2 duo and if you notice around
here<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> capacitors<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.409> solid<00:01:04.949> state

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
here all the capacitors are solid state

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.440 
here all the capacitors are solid state
capacitors<00:01:05.369> those<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> best<00:01:06.240> for

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
capacitors those are the best for

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
capacitors those are the best for
voltage<00:01:06.750> regulation<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.530> they've<00:01:08.010> put<00:01:08.610> them

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
voltage regulation and they've put them

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.990 
voltage regulation and they've put them
around<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.810> CPU<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.549> make<00:01:11.700> sure<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
around the CPU there to make sure that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179 
around the CPU there to make sure that
your<00:01:12.150> CPU<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.810> gonna<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.680> stable<00:01:13.979> as

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
your CPU is gonna be as stable as

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
your CPU is gonna be as stable as
possible<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.760> also<00:01:14.850> last<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.570> long<00:01:15.689> as

possible and also last as long as
possible<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> notice<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.009> also

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
possible if you notice on this one also

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
possible if you notice on this one also
in<00:01:18.240> order<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> keep<00:01:18.600> things<00:01:18.840> cool<00:01:19.080> they<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
in order to keep things cool they have

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.410 
in order to keep things cool they have
given<00:01:20.159> us<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.490> heat<00:01:20.729> pipes<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.299> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
given us some heat pipes here in this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.760 
given us some heat pipes here in this
you<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.290> around<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you know they go right around the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
you know they go right around the
processor<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.000> gonna<00:01:24.150> draw<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> lot<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
processor so that's gonna draw a lot of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
processor so that's gonna draw a lot of
the<00:01:24.990> heat<00:01:25.170> away<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.860> processor<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the heat away from the processor and you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.890 
the heat away from the processor and you
know<00:01:26.909> these<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.390> gonna<00:01:27.720> get

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
know these are things are gonna get

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
know these are things are gonna get
pretty<00:01:28.110> hot<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.680> they're<00:01:28.799> gonna<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.070> pulling

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
pretty hot but they're gonna be pulling

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
pretty hot but they're gonna be pulling
heat<00:01:29.520> from<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
heat from here to there so that's a very

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
heat from here to there so that's a very
cool<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:31.770> alright<00:01:32.490> moving<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.030> down<00:01:33.270> there

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
cool thing alright moving on down there

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.050 
cool thing alright moving on down there
is<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> install<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.610> RAM<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> will

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is where you install your RAM this will

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
is where you install your RAM this will
use<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> 8<00:01:36.840> gigabytes<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.619> dual-channel

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
use up to 8 gigabytes of dual-channel

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.810 
use up to 8 gigabytes of dual-channel
ddr2<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.689> 800<00:01:40.350> megahertz<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:41.520> flip<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
ddr2 at 800 megahertz they flip it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
ddr2 at 800 megahertz they flip it
around<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.329> better<00:01:42.780> show<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> rest

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
around so I can better show you the rest

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.410 
around so I can better show you the rest
of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> stuff<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> board<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.210> there's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
of the stuff on the board if there's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.280 
of the stuff on the board if there's
where<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> connect<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:45.960> power<00:01:46.079> obviously

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
where you connect your power obviously

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
where you connect your power obviously
moving<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> IDE

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
moving on over here that's the IDE

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
moving on over here that's the IDE
connector<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.799> 6

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
connector and then right here we have 6

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
connector and then right here we have 6
serial<00:01:51.210> ata<00:01:51.540> ports<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> does<00:01:52.229> support

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
serial ata ports and it does support

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.219 
serial ata ports and it does support
raid<00:01:52.829> onboard<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> plug<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.110> your

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
raid onboard is where you plug in your

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.830 
raid onboard is where you plug in your
floppy<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.060> move<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.360> down<00:01:57.540> here

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
floppy and then if we move on down here

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.350 
floppy and then if we move on down here
we<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> HDMI<00:01:59.460> onboard<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
we actually have a HDMI onboard there to

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.139 
we actually have a HDMI onboard there to
plug<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.490> three<00:02:02.790> PCI

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149

for<00:02:11.009> those<00:02:11.129> nice<00:02:11.430> large<00:02:11.940> graphics<00:02:12.420> cards<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
for those nice large graphics cards and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
for those nice large graphics cards and
one<00:02:13.830> thing<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.190> nice<00:02:14.370> about<00:02:14.430> this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
one thing that's really nice about this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.770 
one thing that's really nice about this
when<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.910> install<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.240> graphics<00:02:15.570> card<00:02:15.720> if

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
when you install the graphics card if

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.770 
when you install the graphics card if
you<00:02:15.840> look<00:02:15.990> up<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.970> serial<00:02:18.540> ata

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you look up here the the the serial ata

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.480 
you look up here the the the serial ata
connectors<00:02:19.170> are<00:02:19.290> nowhere<00:02:19.830> near<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
connectors are nowhere near it so if you

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.590 
connectors are nowhere near it so if you
can<00:02:20.580> put<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> big<00:02:20.880> graphics<00:02:21.210> card<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.480> there

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
can put a big graphics card in there

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.730 
can put a big graphics card in there
it's<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.780> gonna<00:02:21.990> block<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.560> thing<00:02:22.680> I

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's not gonna block it one thing I

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350 
it's not gonna block it one thing I
didn't<00:02:22.920> like<00:02:22.950> about<00:02:23.070> my<00:02:23.460> one<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.300> my

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
didn't like about my one of my

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050 
didn't like about my one of my
motherboards<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.960> was<00:02:25.080> using<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.130> set<00:02:26.970> up

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
motherboards I was using is the set up

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.890 
motherboards I was using is the set up
works<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.330> right<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.720> when<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
works for right there and when I

works for right there and when I
installed<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.260> big<00:02:28.380> graphics<00:02:28.770> card<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.280> blocked

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
installed a big graphics card it blocked

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.770 
installed a big graphics card it blocked
some<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.030> them<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.300> wasn't<00:02:30.510> able<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> use

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
some of them so I wasn't able to use

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.120 
some of them so I wasn't able to use
them<00:02:30.959> all<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.410> they've<00:02:31.709> moved<00:02:31.890> them<00:02:32.100> out

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
them all this one they've moved them out

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.500 
them all this one they've moved them out
of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.310> way<00:02:32.459> alright<00:02:33.090> let's<00:02:33.240> look<00:02:33.330> at<00:02:33.420> the

those solid state capacitors god I love
those<00:02:55.380> things<00:02:55.730> alright<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:56.820> went<00:02:57.120> through

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
those things alright I just went through

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.170 
those things alright I just went through
the<00:02:57.480> IP<00:02:57.780> 35<00:02:58.739> now<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> want<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.910> set<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.120> down

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
the IP 35 now I want to set this down

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.449 
the IP 35 now I want to set this down
and<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.510> through<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.780> differences<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
and go through the differences in the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.590 
and go through the differences in the
different<00:03:02.580> motherboards<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
different motherboards because like I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.910 
different motherboards because like I
said<00:03:03.750> there's<00:03:03.900> three<00:03:03.930> flavours<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.530> almost

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
said there's three flavours of almost

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.610 
said there's three flavours of almost
the<00:03:05.070> same<00:03:05.310> thing<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.209> move<00:03:06.390> over<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.989> P

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the same thing if you move over to the P

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
the same thing if you move over to the P
35<00:03:07.920> you're<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.430> save<00:03:08.700> some<00:03:08.880> money<00:03:09.030> they

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
35 you're gonna save some money they

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.300 
35 you're gonna save some money they
have<00:03:09.690> removed<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.590> big<00:03:10.739> heat<00:03:10.950> pipe<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.220> if

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
have removed the big heat pipe so if

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
have removed the big heat pipe so if
you're<00:03:11.400> gonna<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.610> using<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.880> quad<00:03:12.090> core

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
you're gonna be using a quad core

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.520 
you're gonna be using a quad core
something<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.810> draws<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.020> lot<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> heat<00:03:13.410> or<00:03:13.440> if

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
something that draws a lot of heat or if

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.110 
something that draws a lot of heat or if
you're<00:03:13.620> gonna<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.860> overclocking<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
you're gonna be overclocking not the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.580 
you're gonna be overclocking not the
best<00:03:15.270> choice<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.260> gonna<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.560> a

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
best choice but if not it's gonna be a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.140 
best choice but if not it's gonna be a
great<00:03:17.010> way<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.160> save<00:03:17.459> some<00:03:17.489> money<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.910> still

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
great way to save some money and still

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
great way to save some money and still
get<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.299> great<00:03:18.360> gaming<00:03:19.049> system<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:20.130> same

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
get a great gaming system the same

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.039 
get a great gaming system the same
amount<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.640> RAM<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.030> installed<00:03:21.330> one

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
amount of RAM can be installed one

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.060 
amount of RAM can be installed one
difference<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.440> notice<00:03:22.650> over<00:03:22.739> here<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.980> only

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
difference you notice over here it only

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.390 
difference you notice over here it only
has<00:03:23.280> four<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.330> SATA<00:03:24.810> ports<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> on<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
has four of the SATA ports and on the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.610 
has four of the SATA ports and on the
back<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.850> doesn't<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.360> firewire<00:03:27.959> other<00:03:28.500> than

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
back it doesn't have firewire other than

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
back it doesn't have firewire other than
that<00:03:28.739> it's<00:03:28.890> almost<00:03:29.160> identical<00:03:29.540> since<00:03:30.540> this

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that it's almost identical since this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.090 
that it's almost identical since this
one<00:03:30.810> only<00:03:30.930> has<00:03:31.019> four<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:31.530> haven't<00:03:31.830> given<00:03:31.890> you

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
one only has four they haven't given you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.590 
one only has four they haven't given you
an<00:03:32.190> option<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.670> raid<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> said<00:03:33.480> this

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
an option for raid but like I said this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.180 
an option for raid but like I said this
is<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> great<00:03:34.080> way<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.709> you're<00:03:34.860> building<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
is a great way if you're building a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.430 
is a great way if you're building a
beginner<00:03:35.610> or<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> mid<00:03:36.060> grade<00:03:36.239> system<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.840> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
beginner or a mid grade system and you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080 
beginner or a mid grade system and you
know<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.739> gonna<00:03:37.920> be<00:03:38.190> about<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.640> same<00:03:38.820> speed

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
know it's gonna be about the same speed

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.370 
know it's gonna be about the same speed
if<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.269> put<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.690> big<00:03:39.810> graphics<00:03:40.170> cards

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
if you put one of the big graphics cards

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.270 
if you put one of the big graphics cards
in<00:03:40.440> there<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.680> you're<00:03:40.799> not<00:03:40.860> gonna<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.160> be

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
in there so you're not gonna really be

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.090 
in there so you're not gonna really be
losing<00:03:41.430> any<00:03:41.730> speed<00:03:42.030> at<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.500> know<00:03:43.590> if

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
losing any speed at all just you know if

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.020 
losing any speed at all just you know if
you're<00:03:44.310> gonna<00:03:44.400> means<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.760> said<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:44.970> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
you're gonna means like I said if you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.430 
you're gonna means like I said if you
mean<00:03:45.180> using<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.630> quad<00:03:45.840> core<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.200> might<00:03:46.320> want

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
mean using the quad core you might want

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.319 
mean using the quad core you might want
to<00:03:46.500> move<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:46.890> one<00:03:47.070> or<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.730> pro<00:03:47.970> now

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
to move up to this one or the pro now

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.479 
to move up to this one or the pro now
the<00:03:48.390> pro<00:03:48.660> gives<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.739> almost<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.340> same

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the pro gives you almost the same

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.800 
the pro gives you almost the same
features<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.180> except<00:03:51.690> they've

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
features of this one except they've

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.229 
features of this one except they've
included<00:03:52.079> two<00:03:52.829> east<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.280> eSATA<00:03:53.790> ports<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
included two east of eSATA ports on the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.509 
included two east of eSATA ports on the
back<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.720> they've<00:03:55.170> given<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.560> their<00:03:55.739> guru

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
back and they've given you their guru

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.880 
back and they've given you their guru
utility<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.570> help<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.840> overclock<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.620> one

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
utility to help you overclock and one

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.890 
utility to help you overclock and one
other<00:03:59.070> thing<00:03:59.250> about<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.549> pro<00:03:59.760> all<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
other thing about the pro all of the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.630 
other thing about the pro all of the
capacitors<00:04:01.410> are<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.709> solid-state<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.400> just

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
capacitors are the solid-state not just

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.479 
capacitors are the solid-state not just
the<00:04:02.700> ones<00:04:02.880> around<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.690> core<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:05.040> system

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
the ones around the core of the system

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.240 
the ones around the core of the system
but<00:04:05.579> all<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:06.030> them<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.390> solid-state<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.920> just

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
but all of them are solid-state so just

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.199 
but all of them are solid-state so just
you<00:04:08.340> know<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.459> have<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.610> figure<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:08.850> which

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
you know I have to figure out which

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.039 
you know I have to figure out which
one's<00:04:09.420> gonna<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.630> best<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:09.930> your<00:04:09.989> needs

one's gonna be best for your needs

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.330 
one's gonna be best for your needs
they're<00:04:10.350> all<00:04:10.500> gonna<00:04:10.680> be<00:04:10.829> fast<00:04:11.070> they're<00:04:11.280> all

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
they're all gonna be fast they're all

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.590 
they're all gonna be fast they're all
gonna<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.579> extremely<00:04:12.000> stable<00:04:12.180> since<00:04:12.510> they're

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
gonna be extremely stable since they're

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.690 
gonna be extremely stable since they're
based<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.989> p35<00:04:13.590> chipset<00:04:14.010> from<00:04:14.100> Intel<00:04:14.489> and
