as<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> roof<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:07.560> it's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
as you go up the roof see it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.910 
as you go up the roof see it's
labor-intensive<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.550> got<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> crawl<00:02:08.940> along

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so we don't slip take another series of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.400 
so we don't slip take another series of
marks<00:02:16.820> body<00:02:17.820> up<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> roof<00:02:18.360> again<00:02:18.690> keep<00:02:19.050> doing

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
marks body up the roof again keep doing

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
marks body up the roof again keep doing
that<00:02:20.240> all<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.300> way<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.540> hopefully<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.410> doesn't

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that all the way up hopefully it doesn't

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.730 
that all the way up hopefully it doesn't
slip<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.640> slips<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.780> got<00:02:24.930> an<00:02:25.020> inaccurate<00:02:25.380> mark

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
slip it slips you got an inaccurate mark

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.980 
slip it slips you got an inaccurate mark
which<00:02:25.920> means<00:02:26.160> an<00:02:26.280> inactive<00:02:26.850> line<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.450> rose<00:02:27.690> we

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
which means an inactive line you rose we

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.910 
which means an inactive line you rose we
cook<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.410> makes<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.340> big<00:02:29.520> crop<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> that's<00:02:31.650> up

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
cook it makes a big crop so that's up

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
cook it makes a big crop so that's up
how<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.490> done<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:34.040> party<00:02:35.510> 80<00:02:36.510> 90<00:02:36.840> percent<00:02:37.080> of

how it done for party 80 90 percent of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
how it done for party 80 90 percent of
the<00:02:37.200> roofers<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.530> America<00:02:37.980> use<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.310> system

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the roofers in America use that system

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.700 
the roofers in America use that system
there's<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.970> couple<00:02:39.150> other<00:02:39.330> things<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.990> paper

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
there's a couple other things a paper

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.860 
there's a couple other things a paper
rolled<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.760> roll<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> base<00:02:42.540> plant

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
rolled that you roll out the base plant

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.620 
rolled that you roll out the base plant
that's<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.860> good<00:02:44.010> idea<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:45.390> tape

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that's a good idea but what this tape

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.020 
that's a good idea but what this tape
does<00:02:45.900> he<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.650> encompasses<00:02:47.430> both<00:02:47.460> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
does he kind of like encompasses both it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
does he kind of like encompasses both it
allows<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.480> roof<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> mark<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.380> want
