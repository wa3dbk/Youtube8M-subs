00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.290 

stage-five<00:00:07.710> investing<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.519> casting

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.880 

the<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:12.930> thing<00:00:13.140> that's<00:00:13.260> done<00:00:13.530> before

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
the first thing that's done before

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.070 
the first thing that's done before
casting<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.970> the<00:00:15.000> margins<00:00:15.540> check<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.930> most

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
casting is the margins check the most

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050 
casting is the margins check the most
important<00:00:16.590> part<00:00:16.860> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> restoration<00:00:17.460> really

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
important part of the restoration really

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.769 
important part of the restoration really
so<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:19.170> round<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> hot<00:00:20.490> wax<00:00:20.670> knife<00:00:21.029> just

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
so we round it with a hot wax knife just

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
so we round it with a hot wax knife just
to<00:00:21.960> make<00:00:22.140> sure<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.670> wax<00:00:24.240> hasn't<00:00:26.119> sunk

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to make sure that the wax hasn't sunk

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.260 
to make sure that the wax hasn't sunk
away<00:00:27.360> from<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> margin<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.170> all<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.180> we

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
away from the margin at all and then we

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.319 
away from the margin at all and then we
just<00:00:30.480> cook<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.960> nice<00:00:31.829> clean<00:00:32.220> edge<00:00:35.329> ready

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just cook back nice clean edge ready

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.540 
just cook back nice clean edge ready
bend<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.590> way<00:00:37.710> around

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
bend all the way around

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.570 
bend all the way around
so<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.350> supreme<00:00:41.800> whacked<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.130> here<00:00:42.310> just<00:00:42.460> to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
so the supreme whacked is here just to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.250 
so the supreme whacked is here just to
show<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.880> difference<00:00:43.240> as<00:00:43.330> different<00:00:43.690> sizes

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
show the difference as different sizes

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.190 
show the difference as different sizes
with<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.130> gold<00:00:45.430> we<00:00:45.610> can<00:00:45.640> use<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.090> thin<00:00:46.360> spring

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
with the gold we can use the thin spring

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.460 
with the gold we can use the thin spring
wax<00:00:47.470> because<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.860> flows<00:00:48.120> readily<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:50.230> use<00:00:50.440> a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
wax because it flows readily we use a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.470 
wax because it flows readily we use a
little<00:00:50.739> bit<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:50.920> sticky<00:00:51.160> wax<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.820> stun<00:00:52.090> one<00:00:52.360> of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
little bit of sticky wax to stun one of

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
little bit of sticky wax to stun one of
the<00:00:52.570> cusps<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.850> stick<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.480> spring<00:00:55.960> wax<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the cusps to stick the spring wax to so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.010 
the cusps to stick the spring wax to so
it<00:01:00.100> seems<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.489> bit<00:01:00.640> counterintuitive<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.480> sprue

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
it seems a bit counterintuitive to sprue

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.840 
it seems a bit counterintuitive to sprue
to<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:03.010> bit<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:03.250> you've<00:01:03.400> just<00:01:03.580> spent<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
to the bit that you've just spent the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.790 
to the bit that you've just spent the
last<00:01:03.940> probably<00:01:04.540> 20<00:01:04.809> minutes<00:01:05.050> making<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.740> look

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
last probably 20 minutes making it look

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.480 
last probably 20 minutes making it look
lovely<00:01:06.010> but<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:08.260> you<00:01:08.350> see<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.650> in<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.010> in<00:01:09.340> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
lovely but when you see it in the in the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.219 
lovely but when you see it in the in the
mold<00:01:09.700> coming<00:01:10.000> up<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.300> bit<00:01:10.510> you'll<00:01:10.660> see<00:01:10.869> why<00:01:11.170> it's

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
mold coming up a bit you'll see why it's

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.219 
mold coming up a bit you'll see why it's
people<00:01:11.650> there<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.130> we're<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.400> making<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
people there so we're just making the

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.990 
people there so we're just making the
wax<00:01:17.410> nice<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:17.890> flush<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.680> into<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.280> wax

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
wax nice and flush into the into the wax

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.560 
wax nice and flush into the into the wax
pattern<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.590> don't<00:01:23.770> have<00:01:23.890> any<00:01:24.450> creases<00:01:25.450> in

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
pattern so we don't have any creases in

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.240 
pattern so we don't have any creases in
the<00:01:25.690> wax<00:01:25.869> because<00:01:26.470> they'll<00:01:26.680> come<00:01:26.950> out<00:01:27.040> as

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the wax because they'll come out as

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.580 
the wax because they'll come out as
positives<00:01:27.790> in<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.210> refractory<00:01:29.020> material

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
positives in the refractory material

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.920 
positives in the refractory material
which<00:01:30.160> you're<00:01:30.340> likely<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.610> break<00:01:30.910> off<00:01:31.210> when

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
which you're likely to break off when

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.130 
which you're likely to break off when
the<00:01:32.080> metal<00:01:32.229> gets<00:01:32.500> shot<00:01:33.340> in<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.630> decreasing

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
the metal gets shot in just decreasing

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.990 
the metal gets shot in just decreasing
the<00:01:35.229> length<00:01:35.410> of<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.740> sprue<00:01:36.009> here<00:01:36.310> that's<00:01:36.790> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the length of the sprue here that's the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.470 
the length of the sprue here that's the
spruce<00:01:37.330> quite<00:01:37.600> important<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:40.630> when<00:01:40.840> we

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
spruce quite important see when we

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.350 
spruce quite important see when we
ringg<00:01:43.140> former<00:01:43.620> missus<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> casting<00:01:44.550> ring<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
ringg former missus the casting ring and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.380 
ringg former missus the casting ring and
the<00:01:46.230> rig<00:01:46.410> line<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.790> allows<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the rig line and that allows the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.060 
the rig line and that allows the
refractory<00:01:48.930> refractory<00:01:49.860> material<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> expand

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
refractory refractory material to expand

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
refractory refractory material to expand
as<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.310> heat<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.730> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> furnace<00:01:54.420> those

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
as we heat it up in the furnace those

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380 
as we heat it up in the furnace those
who<00:01:55.350> who<00:01:55.530> remember<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.640> materials<00:01:57.150> maybe

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
who who remember your materials maybe

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.130 
who who remember your materials maybe
will<00:01:58.230> know<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.800> silica<00:01:59.340> based<00:01:59.460> material

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
will know that the silica based material

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
will know that the silica based material
expands<00:02:01.140> rather<00:02:01.410> suddenly<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.430> about<00:02:02.760> 600

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
expands rather suddenly over about 600

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050 
expands rather suddenly over about 600
degrees<00:02:03.510> C<00:02:04.160> whereas<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.250> metal<00:02:05.520> worked<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
degrees C whereas the metal worked it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.930 
degrees C whereas the metal worked it
would<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.360> expand<00:02:06.720> gently<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:08.760> line

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
would just expand gently so the the line

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
would just expand gently so the the line
is<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.600> cushion<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.200> extra

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
is there just to cushion that extra

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.790 
is there just to cushion that extra
expansion<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.020> expansion<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
expansion we want this expansion to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.420 
expansion we want this expansion to
occur<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.660> molten<00:02:15.990> metal<00:02:16.430> cools

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
occur because as the molten metal cools

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.700 
occur because as the molten metal cools
and<00:02:17.880> solidifies<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.870> course<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.320> will<00:02:19.380> shrink

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
and solidifies of course it will shrink

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.110 
and solidifies of course it will shrink
so<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.540> patterns<00:02:22.410> made<00:02:23.070> invested<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.090> whole

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
so the patterns made invested the whole

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.860 
so the patterns made invested the whole
lot<00:02:24.450> expanded<00:02:25.380> vias<00:02:26.250> heating<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> up<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.180> then

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
lot expanded vias heating it up and then

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.560 
lot expanded vias heating it up and then
metal<00:02:28.530> shut<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> whole<00:02:30.330> lot

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
metal shut in and then the whole lot

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.690 
metal shut in and then the whole lot
shrinks<00:02:31.080> down<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.070> original<00:02:32.490> size

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
shrinks down to the original size

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
shrinks down to the original size
together<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.960> get<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> match

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
together so we have to get the match

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.370 
together so we have to get the match
between<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.070> two<00:02:35.220> materials<00:02:35.580> correct<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
between the two materials correct this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.460 
between the two materials correct this
has<00:02:37.560> been<00:02:37.770> worked<00:02:38.010> out<00:02:38.250> over<00:02:38.430> many<00:02:38.760> many<00:02:39.090> years

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
has been worked out over many many years

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.630 
has been worked out over many many years
and<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> accurate<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.070> many<00:02:41.220> parts<00:02:41.520> per

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and is accurate to many parts per

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.680 
and is accurate to many parts per
million<00:02:41.820> these<00:02:42.060> days<00:02:42.270> yeah

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
million these days yeah

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.830 
million these days yeah
golden<00:02:43.440> cristobalite<00:02:44.340> tend<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> best

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
golden cristobalite tend to be the best

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.640 
golden cristobalite tend to be the best
match<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:47.010> that's<00:02:47.220> why<00:02:47.370> they're<00:02:48.110> faithful<00:02:49.110> not

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
match so that's why they're faithful not

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.980 
match so that's why they're faithful not
too<00:02:49.890> much<00:02:50.070> yep<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:51.060> through<00:02:51.360> was<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> bit<00:02:51.750> long

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
too much yep this through was a bit long

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.980 
too much yep this through was a bit long
there<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.440> need<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.830> pattern<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.990> five

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
there we need the pattern about five

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.780 
there we need the pattern about five
millimeters<00:02:55.290> beneath<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> top<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
millimeters beneath the top of the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.050 
millimeters beneath the top of the
casting<00:02:57.720> ring<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.920> about<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.880> imagine

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
casting ring it's about if you imagine

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
casting ring it's about if you imagine
the<00:03:00.330> gold<00:03:00.510> coming<00:03:00.750> rushing<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.410> sprue<00:03:01.830> if

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the gold coming rushing up the sprue if

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920 
the gold coming rushing up the sprue if
it's<00:03:02.190> got<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> displace<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.239> air<00:03:03.420> that's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
it's got to displace the air that's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.290 
it's got to displace the air that's
already<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> mold<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.820> refractory

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
already in the mold and the refractory

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.540 
already in the mold and the refractory
investment<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.080> quite<00:03:07.350> porous<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.160> only<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
investment is quite porous but only to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.490 
investment is quite porous but only to
an<00:03:08.670> extent<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.300> we<00:03:09.570> need<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.870> pattern<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.410> be

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
an extent so we need the pattern to be

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.680 
an extent so we need the pattern to be
about<00:03:10.620> five<00:03:10.890> millimeters<00:03:11.459> from<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> end<00:03:11.880> so

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
about five millimeters from the end so

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.160 
about five millimeters from the end so
there's<00:03:12.900> enough<00:03:13.800> material<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.670> be<00:03:15.180> strong<00:03:15.540> but

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
there's enough material to be strong but

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.780 
there's enough material to be strong but
not<00:03:16.380> enough<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.950> air<00:03:17.100> can't<00:03:17.430> sort<00:03:17.760> of

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
not enough that the air can't sort of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.420 
not enough that the air can't sort of
seep<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.180> rip<00:03:18.570> through<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.160> bit<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.370> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
seep to rip through so it's a bit of a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
seep to rip through so it's a bit of a
balance<00:03:20.760> there<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.120> go

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
balance there we go

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.710 
balance there we go
so<00:03:21.750> notice<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> sprues<00:03:22.739> being<00:03:22.980> mounted

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
so notice the sprues being mounted

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.270 
so notice the sprues being mounted
straight<00:03:24.720> up<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> pattern<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.010> at<00:03:26.160> an

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
straight up and the pattern is at an

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.420 
straight up and the pattern is at an
angle<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.950> metal<00:03:29.220> shoot

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
angle so that as the as a metal shoot

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.130 
angle so that as the as a metal shoot
through<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.150> fill<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.720> all<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
through it will just fill it all in the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.560 
through it will just fill it all in the
direction<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> casting<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.390> bench

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
direction of the casting so on the bench

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.660 
direction of the casting so on the bench
now<00:03:33.810> we've<00:03:34.080> got<00:03:35.180> some<00:03:37.070> surface<00:03:38.070> central<00:03:38.430> even

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
now we've got some surface central even

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.000 
now we've got some surface central even
agent<00:03:39.000> they're<00:03:39.350> going<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.680> will<00:03:40.830> be

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
agent they're going on that will be

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.400 
agent they're going on that will be
allowed<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.670> dry<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.450> excess<00:03:42.570> blown<00:03:42.989> off<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
allowed to dry the excess blown off and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.190 
allowed to dry the excess blown off and
this<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.400> crystal<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.060> already<00:03:45.420> mentioned

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
this is the crystal I already mentioned

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.650 
this is the crystal I already mentioned
which<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:48.920> gypsum<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.270> refractory<00:03:51.270> material

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
which is a gypsum to refractory material

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.150 
which is a gypsum to refractory material
gypsum<00:03:52.050> open<00:03:52.260> plaster<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.650> Paris<00:03:52.890> based

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
gypsum open plaster of Paris based

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.000 
gypsum open plaster of Paris based
refractory<00:03:53.819> material<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.230> it's

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
refractory material and this is it's

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.059 
refractory material and this is it's
quite<00:03:56.400> sturdy<00:03:56.730> up<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.180> about<00:03:57.450> 800<00:03:58.319> degrees<00:03:58.560> C

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
quite sturdy up to about 800 degrees C

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.490 
quite sturdy up to about 800 degrees C
so<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.599> vacuum<00:04:01.050> mixed<00:04:01.380> in

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
so this is going to be vacuum mixed in

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.780 
so this is going to be vacuum mixed in
the<00:04:01.560> same<00:04:01.770> way<00:04:01.980> as<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.160> did<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.459> your<00:04:02.520> model

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
the same way as you did for your model

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.320 
the same way as you did for your model
material<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:04.260> I'm<00:04:04.440> mixing<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.920> start<00:04:05.190> with<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
material so I'm mixing to start with the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.780 
material so I'm mixing to start with the
wetting<00:04:06.600> agent<00:04:06.959> allows<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.890> stuff<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.370> flow

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
wetting agent allows this stuff to flow

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.340 
wetting agent allows this stuff to flow
into<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.360> nooks<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.720> crannies<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.200> the

Whiteman patent in the same ways the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.870 
Whiteman patent in the same ways the
model<00:04:13.680> material<00:04:13.800> dealing<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.640> your

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
impression it tends to look a bit

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.670 
impression it tends to look a bit
stiffer<00:04:18.419> when<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.750> first<00:04:18.930> mix<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.410> because

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
stiffer when you first mix it because

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.890 
stiffer when you first mix it because
it's<00:04:19.829> mixed<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.519> very<00:04:20.700> set<00:04:21.000> ratios<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.750> might

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
it's mixed in very set ratios you might

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.210 
it's mixed in very set ratios you might
think<00:04:22.139> oh<00:04:22.229> why<00:04:22.440> there's<00:04:22.770> not<00:04:22.889> enough<00:04:23.070> water

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
think oh why there's not enough water

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.900 
think oh why there's not enough water
but<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:25.050> does<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.770> has<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.100> reaction<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.790> that

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
but it does it has a reaction in it that

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.000 
but it does it has a reaction in it that
does<00:04:27.060> produce<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:27.780> water<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.650> need<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
does produce this water that you need to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.850 
does produce this water that you need to
have<00:04:29.340> faith<00:04:29.639> italic<00:04:30.389> alright<00:04:31.050> 30<00:04:31.290> second<00:04:31.710> mix

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
have faith italic alright 30 second mix

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.520 
have faith italic alright 30 second mix
then<00:04:32.330> this<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.450> all<00:04:33.570> written<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.139> yuk<00:04:34.380> of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
then this is all written on the yuk of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.879 
then this is all written on the yuk of
the<00:04:34.590> packet<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.130> as<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:36.360> said<00:04:37.229> we<00:04:37.350> we<00:04:37.620> tend<00:04:37.830> to

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
the packet so as I said we we tend to

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.820 
the packet so as I said we we tend to
check<00:04:38.130> it<00:04:38.280> before<00:04:38.370> we<00:04:38.639> start<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.389> all<00:04:39.540> bad

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
check it before we start it's all bad

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.080 
check it before we start it's all bad
the<00:04:40.830> packets<00:04:41.190> are<00:04:41.280> all<00:04:41.400> pre<00:04:41.669> rate<00:04:41.880> and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the packets are all pre rate and

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.219 
the packets are all pre rate and
everything<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.479> everything's<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.900> little<00:04:43.110> bit

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
everything so everything's a little bit

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.360 
everything so everything's a little bit
simpler<00:04:43.530> making<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.010> diamond<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:47.010> while<00:04:47.220> it's

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
simpler making a diamond and while it's

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.650 
simpler making a diamond and while it's
doing<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.729> you're<00:04:47.940> getting<00:04:48.090> your<00:04:48.300> mold<00:04:48.479> and

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
doing this you're getting your mold and

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.940 
doing this you're getting your mold and
everything<00:04:48.720> onto<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.260> vibrating<00:04:49.770> table

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
everything onto the vibrating table

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.360 
everything onto the vibrating table
checking<00:04:50.850> everything<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:51.479> I'm<00:04:51.630> ready<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.930> go

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
checking everything so I'm ready to go

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.150 
checking everything so I'm ready to go
over<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.669> other<00:04:53.760> bench<00:04:54.030> then<00:04:55.039> that's<00:04:56.039> just

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
over to the other bench then that's just

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.540 
over to the other bench then that's just
me<00:04:56.340> blowing<00:04:56.970> off<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.120> yeah<00:04:57.539> excess<00:04:58.550> surface

minutes your base of getting ready to

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.909 
minutes your base of getting ready to
cast<00:06:30.900> now<00:06:31.050> you<00:06:31.139> can<00:06:31.259> see<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.530> ingots<00:06:31.770> are

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
cast now you can see the ingots are

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.610 
cast now you can see the ingots are
still<00:06:32.160> intact<00:06:32.550> at<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:32.910> end<00:06:33.060> there<00:06:33.410> and<00:06:34.410> we're

still intact at the end there and we're

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.469 
still intact at the end there and we're
looking<00:06:34.650> for<00:06:35.009> them<00:06:35.099> to<00:06:35.130> visibly<00:06:35.639> slump<00:06:36.060> on<00:06:36.300> we

shall<00:06:36.840> form<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.139> pool<00:06:37.380> a<00:06:37.440> metal<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:39.259> can<00:06:40.259> heat

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
shall form a pool a metal you can heat

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.230 
shall form a pool a metal you can heat
this<00:06:40.590> with<00:06:40.800> gas<00:06:41.070> an<00:06:41.220> air<00:06:41.400> or<00:06:41.729> electric

this with gas an air or electric

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.850 
this with gas an air or electric
induction<00:06:42.509> this<00:06:42.840> is<00:06:42.960> electrical<00:06:43.440> resistance

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
induction this is electrical resistance

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.260 
induction this is electrical resistance
so<00:06:44.009> it<00:06:44.070> looks<00:06:44.280> works<00:06:44.520> in<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:44.759> same<00:06:44.970> way<00:06:45.090> as<00:06:45.150> you

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
so it looks works in the same way as you

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.290 
so it looks works in the same way as you

have at home molds up to temperature

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.450 
have at home molds up to temperature
then<00:06:48.449> it<00:06:48.509> needs<00:06:48.780> to<00:06:48.840> be<00:06:48.990> that<00:06:49.620> high<00:06:49.889> for<00:06:50.280> the

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
then it needs to be that high for the

it<00:07:02.970> won't<00:07:03.090> work<00:07:03.270> now<00:07:05.330> everything<00:07:06.330> now<00:07:06.449> has<00:07:06.630> to

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
it won't work now everything now has to

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.270 
it won't work now everything now has to
fit<00:07:06.900> together<00:07:07.139> so<00:07:07.349> the<00:07:07.440> crucible<00:07:07.979> with<00:07:08.159> its

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
fit together so the crucible with its

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.089 
fit together so the crucible with its
hole<00:07:08.460> has<00:07:08.729> to<00:07:08.760> fit<00:07:09.090> into<00:07:09.330> the<00:07:09.930> cone<00:07:10.560> shape<00:07:10.919> at

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
hole has to fit into the cone shape at

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.490 
hole has to fit into the cone shape at
the<00:07:11.190> end<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.550> mold<00:07:11.940> and<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.840> can<00:07:13.050> be<00:07:13.169> a<00:07:13.229> bit<00:07:13.349> of<00:07:13.440> a

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
the end of mold and it can be a bit of a

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.469 
the end of mold and it can be a bit of a
fiddly<00:07:13.800> process<00:07:14.280> and<00:07:14.520> it's<00:07:14.639> it's<00:07:14.940> not<00:07:15.120> aided

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
fiddly process and it's it's not aided

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:16.820 
fiddly process and it's it's not aided
by<00:07:15.570> the<00:07:15.630> fact<00:07:15.900> that<00:07:15.960> everything's<00:07:16.320> really<00:07:16.530> hot

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
by the fact that everything's really hot

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.860 
by the fact that everything's really hot
and<00:07:17.099> you<00:07:17.820> have<00:07:17.970> to<00:07:18.090> use<00:07:18.240> tongs<00:07:18.509> to<00:07:18.690> do

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
and you have to use tongs to do

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.210 
and you have to use tongs to do
everything<00:07:19.080> because<00:07:19.440> you<00:07:19.740> should<00:07:19.860> be<00:07:19.889> wary<00:07:20.130> on

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
everything because you should be wary on

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.430 
everything because you should be wary on
gloves<00:07:20.430> and<00:07:20.759> yeah<00:07:20.970> safety<00:07:21.389> is<00:07:21.930> actually<00:07:22.259> gear

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
gloves and yeah safety is actually gear

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.379 
gloves and yeah safety is actually gear
and<00:07:23.130> then<00:07:23.250> you<00:07:23.370> shut<00:07:23.580> the<00:07:23.669> door<00:07:23.699> there's<00:07:24.330> a

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389 
and then you shut the door there's a

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.170 
and then you shut the door there's a
micro<00:07:24.810> switch<00:07:24.960> on<00:07:25.139> the<00:07:25.229> door<00:07:25.409> and<00:07:25.880> you<00:07:26.880> can<00:07:26.909> see

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
micro switch on the door and you can see

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.550 
micro switch on the door and you can see
