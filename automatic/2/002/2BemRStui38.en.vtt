00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.170
 the straw the article is the name itself says thomÃ© is the junction of the city of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.369
 science fiction 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.949
 in the case the paleontologist Julia 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.359
 is a lucky and art 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.679
 very old and appeared there 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.460
 in the 1800's 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.640
 almost like 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.569
 along with the discoveries of the earliest fossils 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.300
 when the first fossils are discovered, the city also came to know how 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.400
 were these body weights 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.000
 and there they need someone 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.960
 most of the time the researcher did not have this artistic knowledge 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.140
 to allow 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.220
 create the appearance of the animal the owner of the organism whatever it is 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.410
 and there 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 invited to invite the first artists 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.890
 to work together with the researcher and translate the state and scientists 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.670
 for something here 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.310
 all of us could understand 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.930
 that she thinks it's the big 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.340
 cheap paleoarte scene is harper if you get a scientific data 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.560
 this the researcher can understand pass by any friend 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 do you understand pope guarantor? 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.700
 for me it's like a science 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
 in which we have to touch as much scientific information as possible 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 so much stone 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.590
 but I have information 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.290
 produced by the paleontologist 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.990
 to try to pick up part of the fossil that portray some that the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.410
 more faithfully as the animal would be the dinosaur when they want 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.320
 who lived in the past 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.210
 certain told to do for art the basic matÃ©ra and has to be done by 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.590
 this 3d floor 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.860
 but if it is for the artist it is something that I still place myself on this plateau 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.880
 the auction for the artist 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.460
 they rolled up 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.100
 the year was also just the two of them 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.240
 He came back as an apprentice. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.010
 kobrich because I have to know anatomy 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.810
 and have to read articles 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.890
 scientific studies and understand theology 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 understanding ideology then much information 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.030
 Experienced seventy 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 So I could go to the composition of 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.869
 of a copy 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.829
 Christmas 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.199
 Let's say I can go to make money. 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.519
 making you woman have done 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.559
 to start entering the network area for the art 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.289
 they work very sad 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.379
 then what they say a crisis may not be a 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.799
 map shape my agent 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.719
 the same a drawing of one at the end of December was decided on the balance without a 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.639
 scientist friend who does not delete the art 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.839
 the steel straw team that is made with a scientific criterion with a whole the 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:39.549
 care 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 to be really a representation of how it would have been 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.209
 the man had passed 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.349
 the animal 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.510
 as it has been the aspect here neither comments the most probable airplane 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.499
 technician 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.029
 Today I see for example 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.069
 humbled fabion as practical objects 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.089
 I know we're all going to have a biological consequence. 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.829
 of force function 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.159
 as function here is of food 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.260
 in fact her 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 so let me show up because it has those being those equipment 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.139
 you need to have 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.130
 to be able to have a good death is hard 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.190
 few comforts the spirit of the institute carmela dutra the apparatus does not change much 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:20.609
 but several research entities 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.879
 basically a professional can do 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.980
 artistic knowledge in which it may also 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.749
 we have here, for example, the pilot's wing and an excellent father of the artist who 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.569
 is also a researcher 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:32.659
 so he is 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.389
 it's a really cool thing this can happen too 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.889
 the aneel house listening to art to be served science by art 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.649
 then these things can happen 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.390
 but basically the job of my job here was just that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.679
 is to translate those from farewell 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.679
 it is often going to the field together with them 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.089
 do 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.399
 for the peeling job also sometimes I do 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:59.599
 although this is not my job 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.779
 makes me feel like we have land 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.779
 is a scientific research itself a very interesting thing 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:10.599
 the final work 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.599
 so I do this translate from the states 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.549
 for one image and another more culture 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.129
 mouth date of report with thing 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:21.239
 directed
