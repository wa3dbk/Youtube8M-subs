00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
drive here I know there's going to be a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.820 
drive here I know there's going to be a
bit<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:04.950> vibration<00:00:05.520> because<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.830> centered

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
bit of vibration because a centered

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250 
bit of vibration because a centered
driveshaft<00:00:08.610> hanger<00:00:08.970> bearing<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:10.019> goes<00:00:10.170> from

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
driveshaft hanger bearing that goes from

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.020 
driveshaft hanger bearing that goes from
the<00:00:10.410> front<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.769> back<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> little<00:00:11.400> bit

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the front to the back is a little bit

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.359 
the front to the back is a little bit
wobbly<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.410> vibrates<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:14.040> little<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
wobbly so it vibrates a little bit so I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
wobbly so it vibrates a little bit so I
can<00:00:17.369> be<00:00:17.550> pushing<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> crap<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> but

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
can be pushing the crap out of it but

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:39.640 
can be pushing the crap out of it but
just<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.680> fun<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:20.189> she<00:00:20.250> goes

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.850 

actually<00:00:39.950> pulls<00:00:40.220> pretty<00:00:40.640> damn<00:00:40.910> hard<00:00:41.860> even

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
actually pulls pretty damn hard even

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.419 
actually pulls pretty damn hard even
with<00:00:43.010> only<00:00:43.160> part<00:00:43.580> bottle<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.150> really<00:00:44.690> holds

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.919 

that's<00:00:49.429> like<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.850> orders<00:00:50.149> bottle<00:00:50.600> unfairly

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
that's like the orders bottle unfairly

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.310 
that's like the orders bottle unfairly
given<00:00:51.350> any<00:00:51.500> problem<00:00:52.039> oh<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.399> love<00:00:52.850> this
