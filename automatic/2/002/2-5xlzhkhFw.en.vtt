00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.970 
indicated in my discussion a moment ago
that<00:03:53.709> ours<00:03:54.250> were<00:03:54.519> designed<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:54.970> adults<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
that ours were designed for adults and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.890 
that ours were designed for adults and
the<00:03:57.489> reason<00:03:57.760> for<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.390> unit<00:03:58.720> was

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
the reason for that is that unit was

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.020 
the reason for that is that unit was
designed<00:03:59.410> for<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.890> Japanese<00:04:00.580> railroad

we're using our counter for variety of
functions<00:04:08.440> we're<00:04:08.650> told<00:04:08.920> by<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.400> manufacturer

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
functions we're told by the manufacturer

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.809 
functions we're told by the manufacturer
so<00:04:10.849> they<00:04:10.969> were<00:04:11.030> designed<00:04:11.239> for<00:04:11.719> a<00:04:12.370> adults<00:04:13.370> and

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
so they were designed for a adults and

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.189 
so they were designed for a adults and
to<00:04:14.659> be<00:04:14.780> used<00:04:15.100> these<00:04:16.100> buttons<00:04:17.060> on<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.419> boy<00:04:17.959> are

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
to be used these buttons on the boy are

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.930 
to be used these buttons on the boy are
pretty<00:04:18.410> small<00:04:18.709> they're<00:04:18.919> very<00:04:19.070> closely<00:04:19.400> spaced

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
pretty small they're very closely spaced

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.290 
pretty small they're very closely spaced
they<00:04:20.750> work<00:04:20.930> fine<00:04:21.320> they<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> nice<00:04:22.699> solid

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
they work fine they have a nice solid

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.939 
they work fine they have a nice solid
feel<00:04:23.330> there's<00:04:23.990> no<00:04:24.110> problem<00:04:24.500> there<00:04:24.650> they<00:04:24.830> have

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
feel there's no problem there they have

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.460 
feel there's no problem there they have
the<00:04:25.130> same<00:04:25.340> beeping<00:04:25.820> capability<00:04:26.599> as<00:04:26.720> our<00:04:27.139> unit

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
the same beeping capability as our unit

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.230 
the same beeping capability as our unit
but<00:04:27.650> they're<00:04:28.310> just<00:04:28.430> kind<00:04:28.669> of<00:04:28.759> small<00:04:29.030> and

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
but they're just kind of small and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.100 
but they're just kind of small and
they're<00:04:29.360> closely<00:04:29.990> spaced<00:04:30.440> together<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:32.110> you'd

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
they're closely spaced together so you'd

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.600 
they're closely spaced together so you'd
have<00:04:33.139> to<00:04:33.289> try<00:04:33.590> them<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.889> see<00:04:33.949> which<00:04:34.340> one<00:04:34.520> you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
have to try them to see which one you

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.550 
have to try them to see which one you
prefer<00:04:34.729> but<00:04:35.240> we<00:04:35.360> think<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.810> larger<00:04:36.169> display

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
prefer but we think that larger display

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.969 
prefer but we think that larger display
and<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.800> larger<00:04:37.130> buttons<00:04:37.460> make<00:04:37.759> a<00:04:38.349> a<00:04:39.349> nicer

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
and the larger buttons make a a nicer

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.339 
and the larger buttons make a a nicer
