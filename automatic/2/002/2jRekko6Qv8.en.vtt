with<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.910> holster<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.420> well<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.900> we're<00:00:19.770> going

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
with a holster as well and we're going

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.550 
with a holster as well and we're going
to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.070> comparing<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.779> Trident<00:00:22.260> case

same<00:00:23.279> concept<00:00:23.960> silicone<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> hard

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
same concept silicone with a hard

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.790 
same concept silicone with a hard
plastic<00:00:25.680> backing<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.359> casemates<00:00:27.900> which

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
plastic backing and the casemates which

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.049 
plastic backing and the casemates which
is<00:00:28.949> also<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:29.550> concept<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is also the same concept the first one I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.240 
is also the same concept the first one I
purchased<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> seidio<00:00:34.649> active<00:00:34.710> case

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
purchased was the the seidio active case

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.740 
purchased was the the seidio active case
that's<00:00:35.489> why<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> original

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that's why I don't have the original

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
that's why I don't have the original
packaging<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.829> basically<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
packaging for that one but basically the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
packaging for that one but basically the
way<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> works<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.930> works<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
way it works is the way it works for the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.530 
way it works is the way it works for the
other<00:00:40.500> tube<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.670> phone<00:00:41.910> goes<00:00:42.120> inside<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
other tube the phone goes inside the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.930 
other tube the phone goes inside the
silicone<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.430> then<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> hard<00:00:44.760> plastic

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
silicone and then the hard plastic

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
silicone and then the hard plastic
backing<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.719> snaps<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> actually

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
backing just snaps on which is actually

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
backing just snaps on which is actually
pretty<00:00:47.809> simple<00:00:48.980> with<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> model<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:52.350> see

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
pretty simple with this model you see

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
pretty simple with this model you see
how<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:53.190> quickly<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> went<00:00:54.570> on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
how well and how quickly that went on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
how well and how quickly that went on
and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:57.020> goes<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> holster<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and then this goes into the holster you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.060 
and then this goes into the holster you
lift<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.329> clip<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> falls<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.770> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
lift the clip and it falls right in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.450 
lift the clip and it falls right in
there<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.719> closely<00:01:04.460> there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
there and if you can see closely there

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.530 
there and if you can see closely there
is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.360> bit<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.729> bump<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.330> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is a little bit of a of a bump here for

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.200 
is a little bit of a of a bump here for
the<00:01:09.630> power<00:01:09.840> button<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.490> then<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> holster

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the power button and then on the holster

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.580 
the power button and then on the holster
there's<00:01:12.530> there's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
there's there's a little bit of a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.990 
there's there's a little bit of a
section<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> makes<00:01:17.189> room<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
section there that makes room for that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
section there that makes room for that
power<00:01:18.240> button<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> clip<00:01:21.030> doesn't

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
power button so the so that clip doesn't

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
power button so the so that clip doesn't
actually<00:01:21.450> turn<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.259> phone<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> put

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually turn on the phone when you put

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
actually turn on the phone when you put
it<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> things<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it in there now one of the things I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
it in there now one of the things I
don't<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.520> since<00:01:26.939> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
don't like about this is that since it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
don't like about this is that since it's
a<00:01:27.240> silicone<00:01:27.630> top<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.130> can't<00:01:29.400> just

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
a silicone top right here you can't just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.260 
a silicone top right here you can't just
put<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.710> click<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.820> easily

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
put it in and click it in that easily

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
put it in and click it in that easily
sometimes<00:01:33.650> sometimes<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> silicon<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.490> get

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
sometimes sometimes the silicon will get

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.469 
sometimes sometimes the silicon will get
caught<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.439> clip<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.880> doesn't<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.299> in

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
caught on the clip and it doesn't go in

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.039 
caught on the clip and it doesn't go in
there<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.780> smoothly<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.049> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
there as smoothly like that and then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
there as smoothly like that and then
that<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.009> cause<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.880> an<00:01:45.060> accidental

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that can cause you to have an accidental

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
that can cause you to have an accidental
drop<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:46.799> happened<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.369> already<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
drop which has happened to me already a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
drop which has happened to me already a
couple<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> times<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.659> wish<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> hard

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
couple of times I wish this was a hard

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.539 
couple of times I wish this was a hard
section<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> silicone<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.100> anyway<00:01:53.430> we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
section but it's a silicone so anyway we

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
section but it's a silicone so anyway we
have<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> deal<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> lift

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
have to deal with that you have to lift

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.100 
have to deal with that you have to lift
it<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:57.119> drop<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> clip<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.780> top<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it and then drop the clip on top of that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
it and then drop the clip on top of that
to<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> secure<00:01:58.770> once<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to make it secure once you do that it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.459 
to make it secure once you do that it's
a<00:01:59.700> very<00:01:59.880> secure<00:02:00.210> fit<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.659> even<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.259> does

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
a very secure fit and even if it does

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.340 
a very secure fit and even if it does
fall<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:04.110> very<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:04.590> protected

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
fall it's very it's very well protected

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
fall it's very it's very well protected
so<00:02:07.350> most<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.340> click<00:02:08.520> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so most of the time it will click in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
so most of the time it will click in
just<00:02:08.910> fine<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.569> occasionally<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> don't

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
just fine but occasionally if you don't

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.010 
just fine but occasionally if you don't
put<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.770> deep<00:02:11.160> enough<00:02:11.750> thus

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
put it in deep enough thus

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.090 
put it in deep enough thus
the<00:02:13.050> cone<00:02:13.260> will<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.590> cut<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:16.770> won't

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the cone will get cut and it it won't

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.070 
the cone will get cut and it it won't
actually<00:02:17.340> close<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.360> push<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.690> silicone

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
actually close it and push the silicone

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.950 
actually close it and push the silicone
back<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.860> there<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.630> that's<00:02:21.840> one

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
back as you can see there so that's one

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.000 
back as you can see there so that's one
of<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> things<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.350> don't<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
of the things that don't like what to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
of the things that don't like what to
save<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.120> love<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.690> very

save you but I love that it's very

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.600 
save you but I love that it's very
attractive<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.620> color<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.070> very<00:02:26.310> nice

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
attractive of the color is very nice

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.380 
attractive of the color is very nice

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
of other colors but um that's the seidio

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.900 
of other colors but um that's the seidio
case<00:02:34.430> now<00:02:35.430> we're<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.880> open<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.480> Trident

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
case now we're going to open the Trident

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.070 
case now we're going to open the Trident
which<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.270> same<00:02:39.450> concept<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:42.960> also

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
which is the same concept this one also

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480 
which is the same concept this one also
comes<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.530> few<00:02:43.560> different<00:02:43.710> colors<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.280> chose

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
comes in a few different colors I chose

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.650 
comes in a few different colors I chose
to<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.850> green<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.360> oh<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:48.210> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> city

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
to get the green one oh and on the city

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.200 
to get the green one oh and on the city
oh<00:02:48.750> look<00:02:48.930> at<00:02:49.050> how<00:02:49.170> quickly<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.740> comes<00:02:49.920> off<00:02:50.210> you

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
oh look at how quickly it comes off you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.080 
oh look at how quickly it comes off you
just<00:02:51.420> push<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.470> top<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.850> comes

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
just push on it on the top it comes

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.330 
just push on it on the top it comes
right<00:02:54.270> now<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.590> never<00:02:55.860> fallen<00:02:56.250> off

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
right now but it's never fallen off

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.540 
right now but it's never fallen off
accidentally<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> comes<00:02:57.990> off<00:02:58.170> easily<00:02:58.550> now

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
accidentally so it comes off easily now

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.900 
accidentally so it comes off easily now
the<00:02:59.640> the<00:03:00.530> Trident<00:03:02.000> also<00:03:03.000> fits<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:04.790> into<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
the the Trident also fits in into the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.140 
the the Trident also fits in into the
silicone<00:03:06.330> section<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.250> then<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.910> hard

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
silicone section and then the hard

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.590 
silicone section and then the hard
plastic<00:03:09.360> backing<00:03:09.950> clips<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:14.600> it

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
plastic backing clips on and this one it

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.760 
plastic backing clips on and this one it
just<00:03:16.020> doesn't<00:03:16.230> feel<00:03:16.710> as<00:03:17.900> snug<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.580> top<00:03:21.770> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
just doesn't feel as snug up on top the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.070 
just doesn't feel as snug up on top the
the<00:03:23.070> fit<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.150> little<00:03:24.480> bit<00:03:24.570> more<00:03:24.750> difficult

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
the fit is a little bit more difficult

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.690 
the fit is a little bit more difficult
to<00:03:26.240> get<00:03:27.240> just<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.260> then<00:03:29.160> once<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.520> do

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
to get just right and then once you do

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.800 
to get just right and then once you do
get<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.209> right<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.240> doesn't<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
get it just right it just doesn't the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
get it just right it just doesn't the
fit<00:03:34.020> doesn't<00:03:34.320> feel<00:03:34.470> as<00:03:34.620> good<00:03:34.709> as<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> seidio<00:03:35.550> on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
fit doesn't feel as good as a seidio on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.560 
fit doesn't feel as good as a seidio on
the<00:03:36.480> top<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.709> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> see<00:03:38.580> how<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
the top and kind of see how it's a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.940 
the top and kind of see how it's a
little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:39.990> floppy<00:03:40.380> there's<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.800> little

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
little bit more floppy there's a little

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.690 
little bit more floppy there's a little
bit<00:03:41.070> more<00:03:41.220> room<00:03:41.430> up<00:03:41.640> here<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:44.430> good<00:03:44.670> thing

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
bit more room up here the good thing

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.050 
bit more room up here the good thing
about<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.209> Trident<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.830> has<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
about the Trident is that it has the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
about the Trident is that it has the
covers<00:03:48.060> for<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.300> ports<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.590> USB<00:03:49.980> port<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
covers for the ports the USB port and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.610 
covers for the ports the USB port and
the<00:03:52.080> audio<00:03:52.680> port<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:54.050> it's<00:03:55.050> very<00:03:55.230> easy<00:03:55.440> to

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
the audio port and it's very easy to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.949 
the audio port and it's very easy to
press<00:03:55.890> down<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> power<00:03:56.580> button<00:03:56.959> because

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
press down on the power button because

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.520 
press down on the power button because
of<00:03:58.140> how<00:03:58.290> elevated<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:59.090> little<00:04:00.530> protrusion

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
of how elevated this little protrusion

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.330 
of how elevated this little protrusion
is<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.330> doesn't<00:04:03.660> seem<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:04.100> secure<00:04:05.100> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
is but it doesn't seem as secure the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
is but it doesn't seem as secure the
hard<00:04:05.520> plastic<00:04:05.700> backing<00:04:06.150> because<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
hard plastic backing because on the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
hard plastic backing because on the
seidio<00:04:08.660> there<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.840> clips<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:11.030> each<00:04:12.030> corner<00:04:12.420> and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
seidio there is clips on each corner and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.229 
seidio there is clips on each corner and
on<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.959> sides<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.520> Trident<00:04:14.970> there<00:04:15.120> is

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
on the sides and on the Trident there is

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.690 
on the sides and on the Trident there is
anything<00:04:15.570> here<00:04:16.020> on<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.260> side<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:17.040> see

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
anything here on this side so you see

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.650 
anything here on this side so you see
how<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.239> pops<00:04:18.419> up<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.810> real<00:04:18.959> easily<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:20.660> on

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
how it pops up and real easily and on

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.240 
how it pops up and real easily and on
the<00:04:21.870> bottom<00:04:22.049> there's<00:04:22.380> no<00:04:22.530> protection<00:04:22.919> it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
the bottom there's no protection it

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.480 
the bottom there's no protection it
feels<00:04:23.610> good<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
feels good in the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.830 
feels good in the
and<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:24.819> it's<00:04:24.940> actually<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.419> little<00:04:25.569> bit

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and but it's actually a little bit

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.100 
and but it's actually a little bit
larger<00:04:26.560> than<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.849> stadium<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:28.599> we<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:28.930> see

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
larger than the stadium and we can see

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.540 
larger than the stadium and we can see
that<00:04:29.139> when<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.530> try<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.680> put<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.039> in<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> clip

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
that when we try to put it in the clip

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.020 
that when we try to put it in the clip
for<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:30.789> stadium<00:04:32.009> it's<00:04:33.009> it<00:04:33.370> lifts<00:04:33.789> a<00:04:33.819> little

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
for the stadium it's it lifts a little

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.110 
for the stadium it's it lifts a little
higher<00:04:34.180> it'll<00:04:34.449> work<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.160> I<00:04:36.520> like<00:04:36.849> that<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.090> can

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
higher it'll work so I like that I can

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.600 
higher it'll work so I like that I can
use<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.750> clip<00:04:38.500> for<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.770> stadium<00:04:39.340> on<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
use the clip for the stadium on the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.640 
use the clip for the stadium on the
Trident<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> i<00:04:42.870> think<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.169> stadium<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.620> a

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
Trident but i think the stadium is a

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.960 
Trident but i think the stadium is a
little<00:04:44.889> bit<00:04:44.979> more<00:04:45.069> quality<00:04:45.580> made<00:04:45.759> it's<00:04:45.910> a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
little bit more quality made it's a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.300 
little bit more quality made it's a
little<00:04:46.620> thinner<00:04:48.180> yet<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.330> fits<00:04:49.630> better<00:04:50.310> and

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
little thinner yet it fits better and

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.379 
little thinner yet it fits better and
see<00:04:51.699> you<00:04:51.880> can<00:04:52.090> almost<00:04:52.240> see<00:04:52.449> right<00:04:52.720> here<00:04:53.280> how<00:04:54.389> it

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
see you can almost see right here how it

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.320 
see you can almost see right here how it
doesn't<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:56.830> doesn't<00:04:56.889> fit<00:04:57.370> flush<00:04:57.759> against<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
doesn't it doesn't fit flush against the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.240 
doesn't it doesn't fit flush against the
silicon<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.620> then<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.860> have<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.069> make<00:05:00.220> sure

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
silicon and then you have to make sure

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.760 
silicon and then you have to make sure
you<00:05:00.520> push<00:05:00.759> it<00:05:00.909> in<00:05:01.030> there<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:02.289> make<00:05:02.440> it<00:05:02.500> sit

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
you push it in there to make it sit

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.390 
you push it in there to make it sit
flush<00:05:03.069> but<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.610> just<00:05:03.789> pops<00:05:04.030> out<00:05:04.210> real<00:05:04.449> easily

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
flush but it just pops out real easily

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.409 
flush but it just pops out real easily
I'm<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.449> nice<00:05:07.659> case<00:05:08.580> but<00:05:09.580> by<00:05:09.759> itself<00:05:10.150> I

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
I'm it's a nice case but by itself I

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.899 
I'm it's a nice case but by itself I
think<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.810> prefer<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.229> save<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.639> but<00:05:12.639> I'm<00:05:12.789> going

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
think I prefer to save you but I'm going

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.659 
think I prefer to save you but I'm going
to<00:05:12.970> leave<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.210> best<00:05:13.419> for<00:05:13.599> last<00:05:13.810> I'm<00:05:14.669> actually

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
to leave the best for last I'm actually

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.950 
to leave the best for last I'm actually
very<00:05:15.909> satisfied<00:05:16.900> with<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:18.130> case-mate<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.930> I

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
very satisfied with the case-mate that I

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.540 
very satisfied with the case-mate that I
just<00:05:20.229> received<00:05:20.819> and<00:05:22.409> I<00:05:23.409> think<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.159> reason<00:05:24.340> I

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
just received and I think the reason I

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.700 
just received and I think the reason I
like<00:05:24.819> it<00:05:24.849> is<00:05:25.180> because<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:26.169> hard<00:05:26.440> plastic

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
like it is because the hard plastic

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.070 
like it is because the hard plastic
backing<00:05:27.220> is<00:05:27.870> all<00:05:28.870> around<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:30.430> phone<00:05:30.729> if<00:05:31.599> it's

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
backing is all around the phone if it's

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.560 
backing is all around the phone if it's
really<00:05:32.409> welded<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.919> silicone<00:05:33.370> case<00:05:33.639> it's

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
really welded to the silicone case it's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.879 
really welded to the silicone case it's
a<00:05:34.690> little<00:05:34.870> bit<00:05:34.960> more<00:05:35.110> snug<00:05:35.469> than<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.770> other

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
a little bit more snug than the other

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.439 
a little bit more snug than the other
two<00:05:35.979> when<00:05:36.820> you're<00:05:36.940> putting<00:05:37.150> it<00:05:37.330> in<00:05:37.389> the

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
two when you're putting it in the

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.899 
two when you're putting it in the
silicone<00:05:37.870> case<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.889> it<00:05:39.009> goes<00:05:39.190> on<00:05:39.400> fairly

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
silicone case but it goes on fairly

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.600 
silicone case but it goes on fairly
easily<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.360> just<00:05:40.539> have<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.810> align<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.610> the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
easily you just have to align the the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.779 
easily you just have to align the the
different<00:05:42.969> ports<00:05:43.650> just<00:05:44.650> go<00:05:44.800> one<00:05:44.979> side<00:05:45.310> and

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
different ports just go one side and

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.020 
different ports just go one side and
then<00:05:46.360> you<00:05:47.320> kind<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.590> just<00:05:47.800> fit<00:05:48.099> fit<00:05:48.729> in<00:05:48.880> the

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
then you kind of just fit fit in the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.629 
then you kind of just fit fit in the
silicone<00:05:49.449> into<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:50.620> hard<00:05:50.889> section<00:05:51.430> of<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
silicone into the hard section of the

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.580 
silicone into the hard section of the
case<00:05:52.469> but<00:05:53.469> once<00:05:53.770> it's<00:05:53.949> in<00:05:54.130> there<00:05:54.840> it<00:05:55.840> feels

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
case but once it's in there it feels

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
case but once it's in there it feels
really<00:05:57.159> good<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.699> solid<00:05:58.979> all<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.039> corners

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
really good and solid all the corners

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.180 
really good and solid all the corners
are<00:06:00.699> protected<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:02.319> silicone<00:06:02.740> fits<00:06:03.009> in

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
are protected the silicone fits in

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.110 
are protected the silicone fits in
really<00:06:03.550> well<00:06:03.729> with<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:05.020> hard<00:06:05.380> case<00:06:05.789> it<00:06:06.789> turns

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
really well with the hard case it turns

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.330 
really well with the hard case it turns
on<00:06:07.240> easily<00:06:07.780> even<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.349> even<00:06:08.560> though<00:06:09.219> the

phone<00:06:42.000> immediately<00:06:43.380> my<00:06:44.380> my<00:06:44.889> headset<00:06:45.340> but<00:06:46.210> it

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
phone immediately my my headset but it

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.560 
phone immediately my my headset but it
feels<00:06:46.720> thinner<00:06:47.500> than<00:06:47.919> the<00:06:48.070> Trident<00:06:48.570> probably

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
feels thinner than the Trident probably

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.860 
feels thinner than the Trident probably
about<00:06:49.780> as<00:06:49.960> thin<00:06:50.290> as<00:06:50.470> a<00:06:50.560> seidio<00:06:51.419> but<00:06:52.419> it<00:06:52.570> feels

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
about as thin as a seidio but it feels

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.760 
about as thin as a seidio but it feels
very<00:06:53.110> solid<00:06:53.860> because<00:06:54.250> the<00:06:55.150> hard<00:06:56.050> plastic<00:06:56.320> back

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
very solid because the hard plastic back

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.750 
very solid because the hard plastic back
is<00:06:57.389> over<00:06:58.389> all<00:06:58.600> of<00:06:58.780> it<00:06:58.900> instead<00:06:59.590> of<00:06:59.650> just

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
is over all of it instead of just

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.310 
is over all of it instead of just
sections<00:07:00.760> of<00:07:00.910> it<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.180> I<00:07:01.570> was<00:07:01.690> very<00:07:01.870> happy<00:07:02.080> to

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
sections of it and I was very happy to

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.719 
sections of it and I was very happy to
find<00:07:02.350> out<00:07:02.680> that<00:07:03.360> it<00:07:04.360> fits<00:07:04.750> perfectly<00:07:05.020> in<00:07:05.979> my

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
find out that it fits perfectly in my

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.230 
find out that it fits perfectly in my
stadio<00:07:07.120> holster<00:07:07.979> so<00:07:08.979> I<00:07:09.310> think<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.910> winning

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
stadio holster so I think the winning

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.930 
stadio holster so I think the winning
combination<00:07:10.900> for<00:07:11.110> me<00:07:11.139> is<00:07:11.610> going<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.729> be<00:07:12.820> the

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
combination for me is going to be the

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.090 
combination for me is going to be the
case<00:07:13.120> mate<00:07:14.040> with<00:07:15.040> the<00:07:15.190> seidio<00:07:15.490> holster<00:07:15.910> so

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
case mate with the seidio holster so

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.719 
case mate with the seidio holster so
