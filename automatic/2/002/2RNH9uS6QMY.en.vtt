second game after being back I've been

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.030 
second game after being back I've been
out<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.570> town<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> whole<00:00:10.019> week<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> told<00:00:10.769> you

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
out of town the whole week as I told you

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.999 
out of town the whole week as I told you
the<00:00:11.070> last<00:00:11.639> Saturday<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> think<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.840> had<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.830> do

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the last Saturday I think I had to do

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000 
the last Saturday I think I had to do
all<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.219> videos<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.910> advance<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
all my videos in advance and this is the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.150 
all my videos in advance and this is the
last<00:00:17.340> gun<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.330> buff<00:00:19.020> weeks<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.710> let's<00:00:19.949> just

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
last gun for buff weeks so let's just

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
last gun for buff weeks so let's just
jump<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.580> into<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:23.369> fat<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.600> now

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
jump right into it the fat it's now

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.140 
jump right into it the fat it's now
always<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> four<00:00:26.039> bullet<00:00:26.340> kill<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.910> any

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
always a four bullet kill from any

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750 
always a four bullet kill from any
distance<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.680> sure<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
distance and I'm not sure if I like that

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.479 
distance and I'm not sure if I like that
or<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:31.019> close<00:00:31.590> range<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.160> kind<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
or not because close range it kind of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.880 
or not because close range it kind of
suppers<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> deal<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
suppers but what the deal is with the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
suppers but what the deal is with the
fat<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> fat<00:00:35.760> has<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.239> quick<00:00:36.510> fire

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
fat is the fat has a really quick fire

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.660 
fat is the fat has a really quick fire
right<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> typically<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:38.040> guns<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
right and typically I like guns that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
right and typically I like guns that
have<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.910> faster<00:00:39.480> fire<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.200> they're

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
have a faster fire it because they're

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.430 
have a faster fire it because they're
more<00:00:40.559> forgiving<00:00:41.270> than<00:00:42.270> guns<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.230> slower

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
more forgiving than guns with slower

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
more forgiving than guns with slower
fire<00:00:43.739> rates<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.180> miss<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> bullet

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
fire rates because if you miss a bullet

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
fire rates because if you miss a bullet
with<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> gun<00:00:46.289> that's<00:00:46.469> slower<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.090> be

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with a gun that's slower then you can be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.180 
with a gun that's slower then you can be
screwed<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> faster<00:00:49.559> gun<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.950> not

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
screwed but with a faster gun it's not

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
screwed but with a faster gun it's not
really<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.640> big<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> deal<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.050> uh<00:00:52.640> with

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
really that big of a deal but uh with

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330 
really that big of a deal but uh with
the<00:00:53.670> fad<00:00:54.090> I'd<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:55.350> even<00:00:56.070> though<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the fad I'd still even though it's a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.619 
the fad I'd still even though it's a
fast<00:00:56.579> fire<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.120> something<00:00:57.510> about

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
fast fire right there's something about

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
fast fire right there's something about
it<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> swear<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it that's just not right I swear it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
it that's just not right I swear it
takes<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.329> than<00:01:00.390> four<00:01:00.809> bullets<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> kill<00:01:01.440> all

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
takes more than four bullets to kill all

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
takes more than four bullets to kill all
right<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.850> something<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.870> its<00:01:04.080> fire<00:01:04.290> rate

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
right or something about its fire rate

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.899 
right or something about its fire rate
is<00:01:04.650> misleading<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.250> something<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
is misleading or something but I just

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
is misleading or something but I just
swear<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.570> bullets<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.229> miss<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
swear like my bullets will miss and I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
swear like my bullets will miss and I
swear<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:09.659> landing<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.710> takes

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
swear I'm landing for and it just takes

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
swear I'm landing for and it just takes
a<00:01:10.979> lot<00:01:11.189> longer<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.700> kill<00:01:12.000> players<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
a lot longer to kill players then I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.710 
a lot longer to kill players then I
think<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> should<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> really

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
think it should and you know I really

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
think it should and you know I really
it's<00:01:15.869> still<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> greatest<00:01:17.100> gun<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.759> mean

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's still not the greatest gun I mean

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
it's still not the greatest gun I mean
she's<00:01:18.360> usable<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.860> still<00:01:20.130> pales

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
she's usable but you know it still pales

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.510 
she's usable but you know it still pales
in<00:01:20.850> comparison<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.110> ACR<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.009> guns<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
in comparison to the ACR and guns like

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.450 
in comparison to the ACR and guns like
that<00:01:24.229> what<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> gonna<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.250> it's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that what are you gonna do you know it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.770 
that what are you gonna do you know it's
this<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.240> late<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> game

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this when it's this late in the game

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
this when it's this late in the game
there's<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.890> too<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.579> do

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
there's there's not too much they can do

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.010 
there's there's not too much they can do
and<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.000> run<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.420> ammo<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:30.930> I'm

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and actually run on ammo here I'm

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.319 
and actually run on ammo here I'm
surprised<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.970> something<00:01:32.970> you'll<00:01:33.060> notice

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
surprised but something you'll notice

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
surprised but something you'll notice
I'm<00:01:33.450> running<00:01:33.720> red<00:01:33.869> dot<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> fat<00:01:34.409> cuz<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.890> got

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I'm running red dot in the fat cuz I got

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
I'm running red dot in the fat cuz I got
so<00:01:35.880> lucky<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> fat

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so lucky right there but the fat

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.190 
so lucky right there but the fat
actually<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.729> weird<00:01:39.150> iron<00:01:39.570> sights<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually is really weird iron sights I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
actually is really weird iron sights I
just<00:01:40.439> don't<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.710> them<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.579> got<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> big

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
just don't like them and it's got a big

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.200 
just don't like them and it's got a big
enough<00:01:42.090> clip<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.619> fine<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> red

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
enough clip so it's fine to use the red

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.639 
enough clip so it's fine to use the red
dot<00:01:45.390> sight<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.380> lose

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
dot sight on it you don't really lose

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
dot sight on it you don't really lose
anything<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.090> extended

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
anything from not using the extended

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.800 
anything from not using the extended
mags<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
mags and I right think I think it's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
mags and I right think I think it's
better<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.920> looks<00:01:53.070> kinda<00:01:53.280> weird<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
better but it looks kinda weird when you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
better but it looks kinda weird when you
have<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> red<00:01:55.110> dot<00:01:55.290> sight<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.860> thing

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
have the red dot sight on this thing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
have the red dot sight on this thing
