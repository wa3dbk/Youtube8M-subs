00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
going the other way with this you know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.170 
going the other way with this you know
obviously<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> both<00:02:21.020> sides

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
obviously on the both sides

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.080 
obviously on the both sides
makes<00:02:22.750> them<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.959> lot<00:02:23.050> easier<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:24.430> seems<00:02:24.760> fairly

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
makes them a lot easier it seems fairly

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.890 
makes them a lot easier it seems fairly
thick<00:02:25.599> but<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:27.520> slides<00:02:28.060> right<00:02:28.239> into<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.720> dirt

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
thick but it slides right into the dirt

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.670 
thick but it slides right into the dirt
it's<00:02:29.140> tapered<00:02:30.099> well<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:32.319> serrations

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it's tapered well these these serrations

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.910 
it's tapered well these these serrations
are<00:02:33.099> really<00:02:34.000> sharp<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.959> lot<00:02:35.410> sharper<00:02:35.650> than

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
are really sharp a lot sharper than

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.199 
are really sharp a lot sharper than
you'd<00:02:36.069> find<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.489> lash<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.810> handle<00:02:38.319> here<00:02:38.680> is

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
you'd find on a lash the handle here is

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.960 
you'd find on a lash the handle here is
it's<00:02:40.209> very<00:02:40.269> nice<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.840> believe<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.849> one<00:02:42.849> you

how she slides into the dirt here oh
yeah<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.049> effortless<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.290> just

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
yeah just just so effortless it just

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.289 
yeah just just so effortless it just
cuts<00:03:45.400> right<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.880> there

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
cuts right in there

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.530 
cuts right in there
it's<00:03:46.870> really<00:03:47.079> nice

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's really nice

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.420 
it's really nice
some<00:03:49.540> rocks<00:03:49.780> there<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.890> lush<00:03:54.099> but

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
some rocks there I like the lush but

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.509 
some rocks there I like the lush but
this<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.790> definitely<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.650> next<00:03:56.650> step<00:03:56.830> this<00:03:57.459> is

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
this is definitely the next step this is

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.059 
this is definitely the next step this is
really<00:03:57.940> nice<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:59.409> yeah<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.739> you're<00:03:59.890> in<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
really nice so yeah if you're in the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.390 
really nice so yeah if you're in the
market<00:04:00.819> for<00:04:01.260> something<00:04:02.260> different<00:04:02.379> or<00:04:02.709> you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
market for something different or you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.479 
market for something different or you
just<00:04:03.489> want<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.790> try<00:04:03.970> something<00:04:04.330> different

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
just want to try something different

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.420 
just want to try something different
that's<00:04:06.489> scooped<00:04:07.299> or<00:04:08.260> angled<00:04:08.860> nicely<00:04:09.280> the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
that's scooped or angled nicely the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.970 
that's scooped or angled nicely the
blade<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:09.849> it's<00:04:09.970> good<00:04:10.120> for<00:04:10.150> scooping<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
blade so it's good for scooping the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.009 
blade so it's good for scooping the
footprint<00:04:14.980> here<00:04:15.159> seems<00:04:15.519> smaller<00:04:15.940> than<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
footprint here seems smaller than the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.840 
footprint here seems smaller than the
lash<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.799> know<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.310> amount<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.609> space

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
lash you know that the amount of space

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.390 
lash you know that the amount of space
here<00:04:19.840> on<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.049> bend<00:04:20.260> but<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.680> may<00:04:20.949> just<00:04:20.979> be

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
here on the bend but that may just be

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.140 
here on the bend but that may just be
because<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.669> obviously<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:25.960> lot

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
because this is obviously this is a lot

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.350 
because this is obviously this is a lot
bigger<00:04:28.150> diameter<00:04:28.900> than<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.530> de<00:04:30.280> leche<00:04:30.490> handle

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
bigger diameter than the de leche handle

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.580 
bigger diameter than the de leche handle
so<00:04:31.570> maybe<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:31.960> seems<00:04:32.650> like<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:33.010> but<00:04:33.539> I

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so maybe it just seems like that but I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.290 
so maybe it just seems like that but I
did<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.770> get<00:04:35.979> used<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.150> with

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
did have to get used to you know with

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.830 
did have to get used to you know with
the<00:04:37.419> leche<00:04:37.660> I'd<00:04:38.289> have<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> big<00:04:39.270> big<00:04:40.270> pad<00:04:40.510> here

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
the leche I'd have a big big pad here

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.110 
the leche I'd have a big big pad here
