for this tutorial to look good and well
done<00:00:46.780> you<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.590> take<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.980> lot<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.310> time<00:00:48.580> this

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
done you have to take a lot of time this

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.330 
done you have to take a lot of time this
took<00:00:49.360> about<00:00:49.540> two<00:00:50.320> hours<00:00:50.380> because<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:51.010> did<00:00:51.160> mess

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
took about two hours because I did mess

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.970 
took about two hours because I did mess
up<00:00:51.370> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
up and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
up and
so<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.880> more<00:00:54.060> time<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.450> take<00:00:54.600> doing<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so the more time you take doing this the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.940 
so the more time you take doing this the
more<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:55.890> better<00:00:56.400> I<00:00:56.790> would<00:00:57.300> prevent<00:00:58.170> doing

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
more time better I would prevent doing

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.220 
more time better I would prevent doing
it<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.130> this<00:00:59.280> area<00:00:59.580> because<00:01:00.390> every<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:01.080> I<00:01:01.170> do

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it in this area because every time I do

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.800 
it in this area because every time I do
this<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.860> would<00:01:02.400> get<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.660> had

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
this it would get right here and I had

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.180 
this it would get right here and I had
to<00:01:03.900> like<00:01:04.020> to<00:01:04.110> smudge<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> was<00:01:04.860> horrible

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
to like to smudge it off it was horrible

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.930 
to like to smudge it off it was horrible

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
tutorial on just like any other tattoo

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
tutorial on just like any other tattoo
you<00:01:36.960> want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> start<00:01:37.440> off<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.770> cleaning<00:01:37.979> out

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you want to start off by cleaning out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
you want to start off by cleaning out
the<00:01:38.430> surface<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.509> we're<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> be

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the surface and now we're going to be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
the surface and now we're going to be
starting<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.470> flowers<00:01:40.920> flowers<00:01:41.369> are

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
starting with flowers flowers are

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.840 
starting with flowers flowers are
actually<00:01:41.610> very<00:01:42.030> easy<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually very easy because all you do is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.340 
actually very easy because all you do is
having<00:01:44.850> smaller<00:01:45.300> petals<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.140> grow

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
having smaller petals and then grow

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
having smaller petals and then grow
bigger<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> bigger<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.670> repetitive

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bigger and bigger it's very repetitive

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.150 
bigger and bigger it's very repetitive
so<00:01:48.660> it's<00:01:48.810> very<00:01:48.960> easy<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> until

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
so it's very easy and you do it until

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.600 
so it's very easy and you do it until
the<00:01:50.399> size<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.910> want<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.300> be<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:52.610> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the size that you want it to be I know

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
the size that you want it to be I know
that<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.030> looks<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.540> crappy<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:55.050> now

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that it looks really crappy right now

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
that it looks really crappy right now
but<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.590> promise<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.430> look<00:01:56.460> better

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
but I promise you it will look better

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.440

neat<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.020> messy<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.039> later<00:02:08.250> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
neat or messy it is because later on

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
really easy remember don't make the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.300 
really easy remember don't make the
holding<00:03:53.110> black<00:03:53.230> because<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.710> almost<00:03:53.950> started
