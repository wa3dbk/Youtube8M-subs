in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.659> PowerPoint<00:00:01.020> tutorial<00:00:01.770> we<00:00:02.040> look<00:00:02.220> at

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this PowerPoint tutorial we look at

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.730 
in this PowerPoint tutorial we look at
creating<00:00:02.850> PowerPoint<00:00:03.480> graphs<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:04.170> PowerPoint

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
creating PowerPoint graphs in PowerPoint

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.259 
creating PowerPoint graphs in PowerPoint
2007<00:00:07.220> the<00:00:08.220> first<00:00:08.429> thing<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.849> need<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.030> do

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
2007 the first thing that we need to do

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
2007 the first thing that we need to do
is<00:00:09.450> once<00:00:09.809> again<00:00:10.170> use<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.710> ribbon

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
is once again use the ribbon

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.070 
is once again use the ribbon
functionality<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.090> try<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.480> insert<00:00:12.780> our

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
functionality to try and insert our

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.490 
functionality to try and insert our
basic<00:00:13.530> charts<00:00:13.950> using<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.030> insert<00:00:15.450> tab<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.470> can

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
basic charts using the insert tab we can

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.740 
basic charts using the insert tab we can
come<00:00:16.859> up<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.250> insert<00:00:17.609> ribbon<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.210> using

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
come up with the insert ribbon and using

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.870 
come up with the insert ribbon and using
the<00:00:18.840> illustrations<00:00:19.560> portion<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.220> choose

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the illustrations portion of this choose

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.620 
the illustrations portion of this choose
the<00:00:21.000> insert<00:00:21.359> chart<00:00:21.420> command<00:00:23.150> here<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the insert chart command here we get a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
the insert chart command here we get a
range<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> different<00:00:25.109> options<00:00:25.650> available<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
range of different options available to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.980 
range of different options available to
us<00:00:26.430> column<00:00:27.420> line<00:00:28.289> pie<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> bar<00:00:29.939> perhaps<00:00:30.720> being

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
us column line pie and bar perhaps being

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
us column line pie and bar perhaps being
the<00:00:31.109> most<00:00:31.380> common<00:00:31.920> elements<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.430> you'll<00:00:32.640> use

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the most common elements that you'll use

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.690 
the most common elements that you'll use
but<00:00:33.450> other<00:00:33.660> things<00:00:34.020> such<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.469> scatter<00:00:34.920> donut

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
but other things such as scatter donut

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.209 
but other things such as scatter donut
bubble<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.210> radar<00:00:36.630> may<00:00:37.110> also<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.829> useful

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
bubble and radar may also be very useful

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
bubble and radar may also be very useful
for<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.870> stick<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> basic

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
for now let's stick with a basic

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
for now let's stick with a basic
clustered<00:00:41.309> column<00:00:41.670> chart<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.570> by

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
clustered column chart and so by

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.020 
clustered column chart and so by
choosing<00:00:42.930> OK<00:00:43.469> PowerPoint<00:00:44.399> automatically

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
choosing OK PowerPoint automatically

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
choosing OK PowerPoint automatically
populates<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.870> PowerPoint<00:00:46.530> graph<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.129> me<00:00:47.250> in

populates a PowerPoint graph for me in
that<00:00:47.940> format<00:00:49.579> PowerPoint<00:00:50.579> 2007

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
that format PowerPoint 2007

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
that format PowerPoint 2007
unlike<00:00:52.199> PowerPoint<00:00:52.739> 2003<00:00:53.520> uses<00:00:54.420> Excel<00:00:54.899> 2007

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
unlike PowerPoint 2003 uses Excel 2007

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.840 
unlike PowerPoint 2003 uses Excel 2007
as<00:00:56.160> data<00:00:57.149> entry<00:00:57.770> data<00:00:58.770> entry<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.280> excel<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
as data entry data entry in excel is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.209 
as data entry data entry in excel is
very<00:01:00.090> similar<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.660> PowerPoint<00:01:00.920> 2003<00:01:01.920> or

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
very similar to PowerPoint 2003 or

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
very similar to PowerPoint 2003 or
indeed<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.210> similar<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> creating<00:01:03.989> charts

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
indeed very similar to creating charts

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.570 
indeed very similar to creating charts

the different data sets that I want as

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
the different data sets that I want as
well<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> labels<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> categories

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
well as the labels for the categories

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.530 
well as the labels for the categories
and<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.420> series<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.260> my<00:01:13.350> data<00:01:13.530> set<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.540> for

and the series for my data set if for

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
and the series for my data set if for
example<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> clustered<00:01:17.189> column<00:01:17.520> chart

example with this clustered column chart
I<00:01:18.000> wanted<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> show<00:01:18.780> revenues<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> products

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I wanted to show revenues of products

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
I wanted to show revenues of products
over<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.689> perhaps<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.200> my

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
over time I would perhaps use my

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.130 
over time I would perhaps use my
categories<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.220> years<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.780> simply<00:01:24.780> question

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
categories as my years a simply question

putting<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.489> front<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.820> them<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.410> this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
putting up in front of them in this

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.990 
putting up in front of them in this
instance<00:04:00.860> it's<00:04:01.100> really<00:04:01.400> about<00:04:01.610> trying<00:04:01.910> to

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
instance it's really about trying to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.940 
instance it's really about trying to
maximize<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.930> size<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.440> chart<00:04:03.680> on<00:04:03.830> the

may well want to label my axes by
choosing<00:04:50.490> axis<00:04:51.000> titles<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.780> can<00:04:52.409> either<00:04:52.530> add<00:04:52.800> a

vertical axis and in this instance I
will<00:04:58.259> choose<00:04:58.439> a<00:04:58.469> horizontal<00:04:59.219> title<00:04:59.639> for<00:05:00.120> my

more easily assimilate or azan ttle text
now<00:05:08.189> it's<00:05:08.340> simply<00:05:08.639> a<00:05:08.669> question<00:05:08.819> of<00:05:09.150> clicking

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
now it's simply a question of clicking

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:11.839 
now it's simply a question of clicking
into<00:05:09.900> my<00:05:10.020> axis<00:05:10.349> title<00:05:10.770> selecting<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.520> text
