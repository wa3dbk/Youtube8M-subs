00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
Flying Scotsman this engine has been a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.560 
Flying Scotsman this engine has been a
bit<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.940> challenge<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:46.500> say<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.769> least<00:00:47.570> but

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
bit of a challenge to say the least but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.900 
bit of a challenge to say the least but
incorporate<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.949> modifications

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
incorporate some of the modifications

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
incorporate some of the modifications
that<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.570> done<00:00:51.839> for<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.260> engines<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that I have done for these engines like

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.560 
that I have done for these engines like
the<00:00:53.460> oil<00:00:54.290> filling<00:00:55.290> system<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.699> flashing

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the oil filling system and the flashing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.010 
the oil filling system and the flashing
light

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.530 

when<00:01:02.560> Hornby<00:01:03.160> originally<00:01:03.790> designed<00:01:04.239> these

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
when Hornby originally designed these

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.890 
when Hornby originally designed these
they<00:01:05.019> put<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.680> red<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.670> green<00:01:07.000> stop<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.750> go

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
they put a red and green stop and go

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.420 
they put a red and green stop and go
simple<00:01:08.800> light<00:01:09.400> system<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.420> cab<00:01:10.690> which<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
simple light system in the cab which is

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.510 
simple light system in the cab which is
all<00:01:12.610> very<00:01:12.790> well<00:01:12.940> but<00:01:13.150> I'd<00:01:13.960> rather<00:01:14.320> see<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:15.070> crew

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
all very well but I'd rather see a crew

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.160 
all very well but I'd rather see a crew
in<00:01:15.729> there<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> my<00:01:18.850> engine<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.600> fire<00:01:19.780> hold

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
in there so a my engine the fire hold

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.190 
in there so a my engine the fire hold
door<00:01:20.530> has<00:01:21.010> two<00:01:21.550> LEDs<00:01:22.150> which<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.630> might<00:01:22.869> just

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
door has two LEDs which you might just

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.090 
door has two LEDs which you might just
be<00:01:23.380> able<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.830> see<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.960> when<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.380> light<00:01:26.560> starts

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
be able to see so when the light starts

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.580 
be able to see so when the light starts
to<00:01:27.160> flash<00:01:27.250> this<00:01:28.240> means<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.869> regulator<00:01:29.380> is

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
to flash this means the regulator is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.469 
to flash this means the regulator is
opening<00:01:30.040> up<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.520> engine<00:01:30.850> will<00:01:31.060> pull<00:01:31.360> away

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
opening up and the engine will pull away

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:41.280 
opening up and the engine will pull away
the<00:01:37.800> other<00:01:38.800> changes<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.790> ordering<00:01:40.390> adding

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the other changes to the ordering adding

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.219 
the other changes to the ordering adding
steam<00:01:41.649> oil<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> Hornby<00:01:43.450> range<00:01:43.750> means

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
steam oil to the Hornby range means

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.270 
steam oil to the Hornby range means
removing<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.160> chimney<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.940> undoing<00:01:46.540> screw

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
removing the chimney and undoing screw

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.340 
removing the chimney and undoing screw
this<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.490> seems<00:01:48.820> fiddly<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.840> me<00:01:50.020> especially

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
this all seems fiddly to me especially

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.230 
this all seems fiddly to me especially
as<00:01:50.680> I've<00:01:50.860> got<00:01:51.070> fingers<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.580> half<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.910> fan<00:01:52.119> of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
as I've got fingers that half a fan of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.050 
as I've got fingers that half a fan of
hot<00:01:52.390> sausages<00:01:52.899> so<00:01:53.649> I've<00:01:53.860> incorporated<00:01:54.190> about

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
hot sausages so I've incorporated about

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.180 
hot sausages so I've incorporated about
and<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.479> can<00:01:55.750> actually<00:01:55.930> inject<00:01:56.530> all<00:01:56.800> over<00:01:57.070> the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and I can actually inject all over the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:24.199 
and I can actually inject all over the
engine<00:01:57.580> running

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.630 

stern<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.660> they<00:02:25.930> almost<00:02:26.500> finished<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:27.520> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
stern on if they almost finished just a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.370 
stern on if they almost finished just a
few<00:02:27.880> points<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> polish<00:02:28.870> off<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.500> sometime
