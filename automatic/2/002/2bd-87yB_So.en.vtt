really helpful in helping me cope

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.640 
really helpful in helping me cope
through<00:00:25.090> this<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.540> they<00:00:25.750> told<00:00:26.110> me<00:00:26.290> they<00:00:26.410> said

through this and they told me they said

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:37.450 
through this and they told me they said
you<00:00:26.890> can<00:00:27.850> still<00:00:28.210> lead<00:00:28.510> a<00:00:28.690> normal<00:00:29.020> life

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.119 

you

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.970 

so<00:00:43.760> we<00:00:43.940> knew<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:45.019> she<00:00:45.079> was<00:00:45.379> going<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.680> need<00:00:45.949> a

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
so we knew that she was going to need a

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.060 
so we knew that she was going to need a
pacemaker<00:00:46.309> in<00:00:47.260> addition<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.379> that<00:00:48.559> she<00:00:48.859> also

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
pacemaker in addition to that she also

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.540 
pacemaker in addition to that she also
has<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.699> genetic<00:00:50.329> disorder<00:00:51.050> called<00:00:51.620> long<00:00:52.100> QT

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
has a genetic disorder called long QT

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.540 
has a genetic disorder called long QT
syndrome<00:00:52.820> which<00:00:53.980> increases<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.159> risk<00:00:55.370> of

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
syndrome which increases the risk of

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.020 
syndrome which increases the risk of
dying<00:00:55.820> suddenly<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.019> she<00:00:57.620> needed<00:00:58.190> the

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
dying suddenly so she needed the

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.210 
dying suddenly so she needed the
combination<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.899> defibrillator<00:01:00.680> pacemaker

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:20.520 

you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.660 

about<00:01:22.530> 700,000<00:01:23.530> new<00:01:23.590> devices<00:01:24.190> going

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
about 700,000 new devices going

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.219 
about 700,000 new devices going
worldwide<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.590> about<00:01:27.810> 1.4<00:01:28.810> million

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
worldwide that is about 1.4 million

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.270 
worldwide that is about 1.4 million
leaves<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.780> want<00:01:32.140> them<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.410> work<00:01:32.650> well<00:01:32.950> and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
leaves and we want them to work well and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.690 
leaves and we want them to work well and
almost<00:01:33.940> always<00:01:34.420> they<00:01:34.930> do<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:36.190> patients

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
almost always they do and the patients

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.640 
almost always they do and the patients
who<00:01:36.760> get<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.119> devices<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:37.930> feel<00:01:38.200> better<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
who get the devices they feel better and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.969 
who get the devices they feel better and
they<00:01:38.860> can<00:01:39.160> save<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.729> patient's<00:01:40.150> lives<00:01:40.979> but

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
they can save the patient's lives but

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.580 
they can save the patient's lives but
because<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.850> many<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.180> them<00:01:43.420> go<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.750> we<00:01:43.990> there

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
because so many of them go in we there

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.400 
because so many of them go in we there
will<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:44.920> problems<00:01:45.760> it's<00:01:46.390> important<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.320> be

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
will be problems it's important to be

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.460 
will be problems it's important to be
able<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.800> be<00:01:47.950> precise<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.990> familiar

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
able to be precise and to be familiar

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.710 
able to be precise and to be familiar
with<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.520> tissues<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.119> quality<00:01:52.600> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
with the the tissues the quality of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.660 
with the the tissues the quality of
tissues<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.410> can<00:01:53.560> expect<00:01:54.009> different

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
tissues that you can expect different

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.080 
tissues that you can expect different
areas<00:01:55.330> along<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.600> lead<00:01:55.930> as<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:57.190> lead<00:01:57.490> traverses

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
areas along the lead as a lead traverses

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.450 
areas along the lead as a lead traverses
through<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.810> vasculature<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.770> different

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
through the vasculature and different

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.900 
through the vasculature and different
tensions<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.600> can<00:02:01.750> apply<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.910> as

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
tensions that you can apply to it and as

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.200 
tensions that you can apply to it and as
I<00:02:04.390> work<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:06.310> tissues<00:02:06.759> on<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:06.940> daily

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
I work with these tissues on a daily

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.469 
I work with these tissues on a daily
basis<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.229> direct<00:02:08.920> nation<00:02:09.250> open<00:02:09.670> procedure

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
basis in a direct nation open procedure

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.350 
basis in a direct nation open procedure
for<00:02:10.840> my<00:02:10.989> open<00:02:11.860> heart<00:02:12.010> cases<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
for my open heart cases I have a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.710 
for my open heart cases I have a
familiarity<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.320> therefore<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:16.120> translate

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
familiarity and therefore can translate

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.130 
familiarity and therefore can translate
that<00:02:16.989> familiarity<00:02:17.410> over<00:02:18.040> into<00:02:18.840> knowing<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.080> a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that familiarity over into knowing on a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.390 
that familiarity over into knowing on a
2d<00:02:20.680> x-ray<00:02:21.280> image<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.180> less<00:02:22.330> what<00:02:22.600> kind<00:02:22.630> of

2d x-ray image more or less what kind of
tension<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.519> tissues<00:02:24.820> can<00:02:25.030> tolerate<00:02:25.660> at<00:02:26.110> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
tension the tissues can tolerate at that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.220 
tension the tissues can tolerate at that
place<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.950> also<00:02:27.910> where<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.570> had<00:02:28.750> have
