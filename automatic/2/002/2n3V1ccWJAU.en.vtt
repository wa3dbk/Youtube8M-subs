event<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:18.650> time<00:00:18.830> it's<00:00:19.040> not<00:00:19.190> Easter<00:00:19.810> yeah

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
event this time it's not Easter yeah

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.929 
event this time it's not Easter yeah
then<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:21.740> best<00:00:21.950> thing<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:22.430> one<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.850> the

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
then the best thing is that one that the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.350 
then the best thing is that one that the
way<00:00:23.090> is<00:00:23.360> so<00:00:23.720> good<00:00:24.490> but<00:00:25.490> I<00:00:25.520> mean<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.090> track

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
way is so good but I mean the track

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.929 
way is so good but I mean the track
looks<00:00:26.710> more<00:00:27.710> flat<00:00:27.980> than<00:00:28.220> previous<00:00:28.910> years

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
looks more flat than previous years

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.620 
looks more flat than previous years
which<00:00:29.720> is<00:00:29.750> not<00:00:30.680> better<00:00:31.460> or<00:00:31.820> worse<00:00:32.090> but<00:00:32.419> it's

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
which is not better or worse but it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.670 
which is not better or worse but it's
different<00:00:33.110> as<00:00:33.530> normally<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.170> two<00:00:36.170> categories

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
different as normally and two categories

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.470 
different as normally and two categories
also<00:00:37.010> I've<00:00:37.100> never<00:00:37.340> do<00:00:37.940> before<00:00:38.090> with<00:00:38.450> a

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
also I've never do before with a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.960 
also I've never do before with a
one-eyed<00:00:38.870> electric<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.530> for<00:00:39.739> me<00:00:39.860> my<00:00:40.340> fairways

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
one-eyed electric so for me my fairways

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.599 
one-eyed electric so for me my fairways
and<00:00:41.690> it's<00:00:41.870> not<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:42.320> easy<00:00:42.350> also<00:00:42.949> to<00:00:43.129> make<00:00:43.399> both

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
and it's not so easy also to make both

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.729 
and it's not so easy also to make both
places<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.210> same<00:00:44.420> race<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:44.899> I<00:00:45.079> mean<00:00:45.559> it's

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
places the same race but I mean it's

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.889 
places the same race but I mean it's
dialectic<00:00:46.699> is<00:00:46.789> more<00:00:47.000> for<00:00:47.180> fun<00:00:47.359> than<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.750> other

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
dialectic is more for fun than the other

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.520 
dialectic is more for fun than the other
one<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.300> how<00:00:50.300> about<00:00:50.359> the<00:00:50.600> car<00:00:50.809> electric<00:00:51.289> car

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
one and how about the car electric car

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.029 
one and how about the car electric car
goes<00:00:51.739> well<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.910> nitro<00:00:53.390> car<00:00:53.600> was<00:00:53.840> not<00:00:54.829> so

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
goes well and the nitro car was not so

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.819 
goes well and the nitro car was not so
bad<00:00:55.219> not<00:00:55.429> so<00:00:55.640> good<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.109> we<00:00:57.109> find<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.559> tell

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
bad not so good but we find and tell

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.150 
bad not so good but we find and tell
that<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.309> chances<00:00:58.730> were<00:00:58.760> spent<00:00:59.269> and<00:00:59.539> I<00:01:00.160> hope

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
that the chances were spent and I hope

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.329 
that the chances were spent and I hope
it<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.170> reason<00:01:03.170> why<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.410> car<00:01:03.949> was<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it is the reason why the car was and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.540 
it is the reason why the car was and
