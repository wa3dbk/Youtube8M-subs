I think we'll be inert soon and trouble
is<00:01:33.759> not<00:01:33.880> only<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.420> music<00:01:34.869> carry<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.380> they

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
is not only the music carry that they

is not only the music carry that they
picked<00:01:35.979> up<00:01:36.159> love<00:01:36.369> lately<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:38.140> come<00:01:38.409> people

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
picked up love lately how come people

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.070 
picked up love lately how come people
are<00:01:39.340> start<00:01:39.640> using<00:01:39.880> match<00:01:40.240> being<00:01:40.540> from<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
are start using match being from the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.410 
are start using match being from the
start<00:01:41.380> they<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.799> Sochi<00:01:42.100> rows<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.759> motion<00:01:43.270> with

start they in Sochi rows of motion with

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.710 
start they in Sochi rows of motion with
me<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.899> think<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.070> main<00:01:45.369> reason<00:01:45.430> why<00:01:46.210> merely

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
me I think the main reason why merely

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.260 
me I think the main reason why merely
carries<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.110> huge<00:01:47.440> down<00:01:47.799> because<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.970> metagame

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
carries a huge down because the metagame

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.870 
carries a huge down because the metagame
has<00:01:49.570> changed<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.920> lot<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.340> teams<00:01:51.700> that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
has changed and a lot of teams that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.719 
has changed and a lot of teams that
either<00:01:52.119> doing<00:01:52.509> two<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.259> or<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:54.310> char

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
either doing two to one or like char

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.450 
either doing two to one or like char
length<00:01:54.940> no<00:01:55.149> longer<00:01:55.450> exists<00:01:55.810> sir<00:01:56.310> yeah<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.369> think

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
length no longer exists sir yeah I think

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.859 
length no longer exists sir yeah I think
that's<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.820> main<00:01:58.030> reason<00:01:58.060> why<00:01:58.509> merely

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
that's the main reason why merely

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.800 
that's the main reason why merely
carries<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.490> thing<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:01.300> do<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.479> prepare

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
carries a thing is what do you prepare

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.840 
carries a thing is what do you prepare

vein yeah ah I teaching you yeah I think

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.040 
vein yeah ah I teaching you yeah I think
we're<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.290> TDM<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.220> msi<00:02:42.670> will<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.000> through<00:02:43.240> and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.720 

I'm<00:02:47.050> not<00:02:47.350> too<00:02:47.470> sure<00:02:47.620> about<00:02:50.220> lions<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.400> want<00:02:51.610> all

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
I'm not too sure about lions I want all

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.700 
I'm not too sure about lions I want all
the<00:02:51.880> matches<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.390> far<00:02:52.420> do<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.110> think<00:02:53.170> there

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
the matches so far do you think there

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.830 
the matches so far do you think there
will<00:02:53.800> be<00:02:53.860> tough<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.490> invest<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.510> final

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
will be tough if you invest in the final

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.380 
will be tough if you invest in the final
yeah<00:02:56.650> they're<00:02:56.890> coming<00:02:56.980> Deb<00:02:57.400> line<00:02:58.180> to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
yeah they're coming Deb line to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.420 
yeah they're coming Deb line to
definitely<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.930> strongest<00:02:59.170> thing<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.770> we

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
definitely the strongest thing that we

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.900 
definitely the strongest thing that we
are<00:03:00.550> afraid<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:01.200> I've<00:03:02.200> noticed<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:03.640> lights

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
are afraid of I've noticed in lights

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.170 
are afraid of I've noticed in lights
they<00:03:04.270> have<00:03:04.390> arrows<00:03:04.890> from<00:03:05.890> California<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
they have arrows from California and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.100 
they have arrows from California and
also<00:03:07.570> your<00:03:07.720> team<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:09.160> are<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.870> equally<00:03:10.870> find

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
also your team you are like equally find

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.540 
also your team you are like equally find
of<00:03:11.260> carry<00:03:11.530> plane<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.910> my<00:03:13.030> opinion<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:14.110> think

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
of carry plane in my opinion you think

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.030 
of carry plane in my opinion you think
the<00:03:15.550> metagame<00:03:15.850> with<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:16.810> moonstone<00:03:17.740> carry

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
the metagame with like moonstone carry

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.210 
the metagame with like moonstone carry
is<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:19.330> of<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.570> reasons<00:03:19.930> why<00:03:20.110> your<00:03:20.710> teams<00:03:20.980> are

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
is one of the reasons why your teams are

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.060 
is one of the reasons why your teams are
doing<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.790> good<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.410> all<00:03:23.620> comes<00:03:23.860> down

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
doing so good I think it all comes down

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.620 
doing so good I think it all comes down
to<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:25.890> trading<00:03:26.890> towers<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.420> it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
to like trading towers and like it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.870 
to like trading towers and like it's
really<00:03:28.990> important<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.560> get<00:03:29.800> early<00:03:30.040> towers<00:03:30.640> and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
really important to get early towers and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.700 
really important to get early towers and
that<00:03:31.090> will<00:03:31.240> determine<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.720> game<00:03:31.990> like<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:35.290> also

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
that will determine the game like I also

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.850 
that will determine the game like I also
want<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.100> talk<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> little<00:03:36.610> about<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.390> about

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
want to talk a little about it's about

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.800 
want to talk a little about it's about
girls<00:03:38.860> used<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.340> play<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:39.790> some<00:03:40.030> 60<00:03:40.480> yeah

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
girls used to play with some 60 yeah

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.500 
girls used to play with some 60 yeah
you're<00:03:41.290> like<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.250> only<00:03:42.490> Australian<00:03:43.240> is

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
you're like the only Australian is

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.620 
you're like the only Australian is
national<00:03:44.050> no<00:03:44.680> player

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
national no player

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.340 
national no player
you<00:03:46.990> decide<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:48.120> form<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.450> start<00:03:49.900> playing<00:03:50.140> with

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you decide to form or start playing with

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.400 
you decide to form or start playing with
home<00:03:50.560> enables<00:03:50.950> feelings<00:03:51.480> well<00:03:52.480> who<00:03:53.260> are

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
home enables feelings well who are

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.790 
home enables feelings well who are
playing<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.740> complexity<00:03:54.250> for<00:03:54.520> about

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
playing this complexity for about

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.170 
playing this complexity for about
and<00:03:56.600> like<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.870> they<00:03:58.710> came<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.190> time<00:03:59.460> where<00:03:59.670> I

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and like I they came to a time where I

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.240 
and like I they came to a time where I
wasn't<00:04:00.660> online<00:04:00.840> as<00:04:01.170> much<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.650> rarely<00:04:01.920> played

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
wasn't online as much so I rarely played

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.000 
wasn't online as much so I rarely played
with<00:04:02.400> them<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.790> i<00:04:03.240> joined<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.380> australian

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
with them and i joined the australian

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.950 
with them and i joined the australian
team<00:04:05.250> ash<00:04:05.880> Reddington<00:04:06.390> asked<00:04:06.630> me<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.930> join

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
team ash Reddington asked me to join

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.110 
team ash Reddington asked me to join
them<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.740> all<00:04:07.950> Australian<00:04:08.610> land<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
them just for all Australian land of it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.840 
them just for all Australian land of it
so<00:04:09.890> yeah<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:10.920> started<00:04:11.310> playing<00:04:11.460> with<00:04:11.610> them<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
so yeah I started playing with them a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.759 
so yeah I started playing with them a
lot<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.390> then<00:04:13.760> yeah<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:15.600> yeah<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.320> with

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
lot and then yeah but yeah and with

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.940 
lot and then yeah but yeah and with
complexity<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:17.910> are<00:04:18.180> no<00:04:18.330> effective<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.650> think

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
complexity we are no effective you think

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.250 
complexity we are no effective you think
that<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.060> started<00:04:21.480> playing<00:04:21.750> with<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
that you started playing with the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.200 
that you started playing with the
Australians<00:04:22.830> was<00:04:23.010> important<00:04:23.640> because<00:04:23.790> you

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
Australians was important because you

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.150 
Australians was important because you
could<00:04:24.420> like<00:04:25.020> bring<00:04:25.170> lots<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.530> experience<00:04:26.010> to

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
could like bring lots of experience to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.030 
could like bring lots of experience to
the<00:04:26.190> table<00:04:26.390> let<00:04:27.390> me<00:04:27.480> see<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.660> they<00:04:28.620> are<00:04:28.650> wont

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
the table let me see that they are wont

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.880 
the table let me see that they are wont
to<00:04:29.100> distinction<00:04:29.670> work<00:04:29.850> yeah<00:04:30.510> i<00:04:31.080> actually

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
to distinction work yeah i actually

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.150 
to distinction work yeah i actually
prefer<00:04:32.390> playing<00:04:33.390> with<00:04:33.960> frenetic<00:04:34.920> away

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
prefer playing with frenetic away

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.270 
prefer playing with frenetic away
because<00:04:35.400> i<00:04:36.030> am<00:04:36.720> i'm<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.500> leader<00:04:37.710> now<00:04:37.950> so<00:04:38.250> I

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
because i am i'm the leader now so I
