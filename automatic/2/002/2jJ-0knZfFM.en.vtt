00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 how do you turn a ps3 into a ps4? 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello I'm martrix that's exactly 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.960
 Gets to a new video today 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.330
 it's a very, very funny gameplay 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.849
 very very very strange gameplay clear 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.720
 pink child is still relatively normal though 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 with time 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500
 you will do or have eyes 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.720
 maybe already experienced something like that yourself 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.670
 write me my comments the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.859
 story so that's with you yesterday evening 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.439
 my buddy alex normal black ops 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.180
 2 was looking for why exactly next 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.760
 day, of course, beta follows today 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 and I thought my aiming you can 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.589
 a few more good exercises a bit 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.780
 tolerated training then I thought so 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.879
 hey black ops was three with black ops 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.129
 still the most time to breed here 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.440
 just the night through and eventually 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.540
 on new town then something came 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.400
 and you know it from my earlier ones 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.680
 videos from my previous videos me 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.350
 I am an absolute hardener against hackers 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.150
 and modern but this time there was one 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.140
 Exception because I just found it 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.330
 hilarious what the hacker 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.210
 the murderer of the conjured up has that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.090
 was just so random that has something of 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.659
 that would make no sense 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.700
 where really respectful because 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.380
 there is absolute from front to back 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.090
 nothing makes sense of one 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.789
 exploding dog over one 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.250
 flying dog over any 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.109
 Outstanding building care package is so 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.399
 from stocks and of course the 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.929
 classic on board but actually 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.619
 Everything with you and you have to take a closer look 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.719
 look 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.490
 I would have in such a short time a 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.109
 of course fun if so what now 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.359
 I would have done more often 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.189
 do not like it but as a small one 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.990
 Variation would not be bad though 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.149
 I also think of the blatant 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 murdered in mp3 so mw3 with the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.950
 invisible invulnerable hackers 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.719
 it already slow black ops 2 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.810
 over and I hope that black ops 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.549
 Three will not flop but raises the beta 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.259
 so today is here on wednesday 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.090
 namely the video on officially 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.560
 I have not started yet 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.819
 played that is because I still 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.069
 no playstation 4 at all 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.600
 but the problem I would have soon in 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.520
 can solve the next hours 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.020
 In any case , I already have yesterday 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.370
 I watched my live stream 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.670
 some commentators could already 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.849
 play earlier and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.760
 It's pretty good off with few people 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.590
 already pretty busy and also 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.690
 a little bit yes I'll tell you 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.300
 We have seven now 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 Once you have a thing in mind, do that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.450
 is the black ops 2 beta and around it completely 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.610
 in short, clearly we do what we do 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 if i play call of duty what is 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.750
 our goal is to destroy the enemy 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.280
 clear anyway not everyone wants to be good at 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.590
 call of duty I think 90 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.140
 percent of people just want the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 best game player play really crass 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.910
 be and give a mega that of course applies 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.410
 for the youtuber as well as for me 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
 just say the gamer's now 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.700
 do not make videos but still is 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.500
 let's say the atmosphere a bit 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.959
 tense in the beta because most 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.610
 Of course, people clearly have call of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.640
 Duty you do that when you break something 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.319
 I want to try but some take the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.620
 beta way too seriously because we have to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.560
 Consider people the beta is really for 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.500
 because the whole stats do not care if 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.140
 you only have 0.0001 hkd or one now 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.329
 four akw at the end in the finished game 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.660
 the whole does not implement you speak 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.250
 will not work with level 20 now though 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.310
 The game is done immediately with level 20 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.070
 No, everything will be reset 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.410
 no collected progress for the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.540
 beta from therefore you can actually from 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.600
 principle try everything at the beta 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.680
 can pack bad and there are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 actually no sense now 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.010
 a game rage to tilt if you are now 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.120
 times shit because it is ne beta and me 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.680
 The developers also think that is true 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.670
 well done in battlefield 3 it was to 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.640
 example at that time different 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.959
 A beta is just there to test you 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.400
 just feels unobserved you can 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.440
 just feel unobserved 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.970
 I just try everything out of people 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.680
 of course, I'll watch that too 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.120
 I'm just beautiful a few right 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.160
 nice gameplay games but still 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.500
 I do not have that need right now 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.920
 I will do my 3 hkd me to 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.510
 own the most blatant weapons so 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.579
 really just the one blatant weapon 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.530
 but I want everything colorful 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.780
 Just give me a look 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.579
 get everything and I guess 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.070
 so that's the most fun too 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.260
 call of duty and ambition that are 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.210
 two terms the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.710
 hang on, I think already close 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.750
 of course next to the words 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.130
 like flame and the word probably 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.810
 now also rest and so on 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.710
 son of a bitch and call of duty that is 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.340
 probably already like brothers and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.500
 sister, lately I'm listening 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.730
 Really so much emotions in the game right in 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.670
 black ops comes with me it was that 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.120
 meanwhile only German play and there 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.490
 some fly already the values ​​fell 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.230
 busy and great stuff but people 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.210
 that's the way it was with the video 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.620
 just a short announcement to 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.390
 Beta and I did not want you this 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.740
 Comic hacker gameplay withheld 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.660
 therefore I wish you a lot 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.490
 fun if you play the beta maybe 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.890
 let's see on the maps and in this 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.640
 meaning rated the video to then look 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.640
 and goodbye
