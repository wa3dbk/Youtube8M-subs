screen<00:00:51.329> you'll<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.079> preset<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.219> was

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
screen you'll see the preset that was

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
screen you'll see the preset that was
used<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> create<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> occasional<00:00:54.960> tweet<00:00:55.289> one

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
used to create it occasional tweet one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
used to create it occasional tweet one
or<00:00:55.620> two<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.730> chosen<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> range

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
or two of them and I've chosen a range

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
or two of them and I've chosen a range
of<00:00:57.510> sounds<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.109> clean<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:58.920> driven

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of sounds here from clean to over driven

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
of sounds here from clean to over driven
so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> good<00:01:00.539> sense<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so you can get a good sense of what the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:03:22.000 
so you can get a good sense of what the
apps<00:01:02.190> capable<00:01:02.789> of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.339 

I'm<00:03:23.010> q+<00:03:23.489> now<00:03:23.700> house<00:03:23.970> audio<00:03:24.420> both<00:03:24.599> supports<00:03:25.170> so

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
I'm q+ now house audio both supports so

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.860 
I'm q+ now house audio both supports so
we<00:03:25.500> could<00:03:25.680> use<00:03:25.799> this<00:03:25.980> an<00:03:26.129> input<00:03:26.579> app<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:27.569> audio

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
we could use this an input app in audio

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.530 
we could use this an input app in audio
bus<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.530> feed<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.010> output<00:03:29.280> from<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.269> guitar

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
bus and feed the output from the guitar

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.050 
bus and feed the output from the guitar
amp<00:03:30.720> sim<00:03:31.019> into<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> door

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
amp sim into a door

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.149 
amp sim into a door
miss<00:03:33.329> case<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.930> use<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.409> cube<00:03:34.680> basis

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
miss case I'm going to use a cube basis

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.000 
miss case I'm going to use a cube basis
and<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:35.939> makes<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.450> very<00:03:36.480> easy<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.260> use<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
and this makes it very easy to use the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.740 
and this makes it very easy to use the
guitar<00:03:38.310> sounds<00:03:38.849> as<00:03:39.000> part<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.359> an<00:03:39.450> overall

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
guitar sounds as part of an overall

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.000 
guitar sounds as part of an overall
recording<00:03:40.290> project

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
recording project

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.059 
recording project
so<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:41.939> I'll<00:03:42.000> buy<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.150> sound<00:03:42.420> set<00:03:42.720> up<00:03:43.069> over

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
so here I'll buy the sound set up over

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.479 
so here I'll buy the sound set up over
driven<00:03:44.549> sounds<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:45.329> use<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.769> press
