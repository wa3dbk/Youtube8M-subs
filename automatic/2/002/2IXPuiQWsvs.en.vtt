00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 more about how do I do today I 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.299
 will teach you how to cook pasta and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 yes it sounds simple but for those who 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.840
 do not know it's always good to have 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.049
 an example let's go 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.549
 start by putting a pan in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 needs other people needs a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.859
 pan from about oahu island 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 it takes half more more 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.869
 the amount of pact you have me so 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 I am alone to the greatest 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 classics like that it's perfect 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.579
 so we start by doing this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 boil the water and we will add a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 big handle of coarse salt so if you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.969
 do not have coarse salt 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.149
 small salt 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.050
 it does not take enough 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.399
 then for cooking pasta 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.950
 so I do not have the case here is the hand 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.760
 because it might be known to him 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.620
 there is no definite time next 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.899
 the steps you buy on the packages 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 its marks and the cooking time 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.870
 then you will have a time for the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 cooking closes a time for cooking 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.130
 al dente ie between the farm and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.619
 and the dying vice versa and the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 melting and obviously the last one that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:22.650
 israel fauna are so well read 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.810
 this little this little piece is marked 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 on all east on all 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.490
 on all the packets the water gets to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.140
 boiling we will now add 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.630
 the tent was fatal or the quantity 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.270
 beautiful coat to jump me I put one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.509
 good handle batteries can more 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.460
 he is a big eater 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.110
 so once again a reminder 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.700
 that you put no more need to put 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 outside 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 and then there I am politics 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.299
 so I'm going to make sure to make them 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.610
 get into the silver pan a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.229
 little bit then they do it quietly 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.399
 6 and the legs of the shells or 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.700
 stuff like that we do not need to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.890
 do that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.299
 by against any tale that quote 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.170
 shells and mix them up a little 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.330
 little once they are said in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.619
 water for easter schools elsewhere 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.349
 it's exactly also refers 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.160
 with but Spain is said to be in those 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.760
 it will be put correctly here 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.319
 then one last little thing ortolo 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.090
 hey he can you put your balls 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.730
 especially you fire down because 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.260
 otherwise I make you home 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.519
 if you put it hard this is it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 will give there will be impulses and 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.690
 it's going to be a kind of moss and 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.700
 it is especially that one must not chew one's 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.510
 words it's going to be everywhere 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 so how did I leave fire 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.440
 maybe the way to do 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.030
 well yeah it does not do it but 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.970
 especially you turn the heat on you 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.890
 put your pasta and you wait for yourself 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.110
 wait the necessary time to 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.680
 cooking ie 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.689
 minutes 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.390
 it is rare that it goes beyond the ten 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.709
 minutes and customers we will end up 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.769
 drain and invited a little bit of 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.269
 butter tusson time is over 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.480
 so I have the hands of a tea so 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.170
 I will really have had the time on 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.209
 minimum that obviously needs if you 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.230
 you like them softer you 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.060
 cook a little longer 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.930
 to these problems then what are we going to do 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.340
 now we are going to put out the fire then 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.639
 obviously you can listen to them 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.019
 directly in your and diego - there I 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.310
 will just make you see that the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.450
 simpler for me it was really 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:44.290
 nothing complicated to take the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:48.389
 casserole nail or pasta we wait 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.389
 that this one is well disgusted 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.190
 you can wait two three minutes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.169
 all this you have a 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.349
 if you are if you put them on 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:04.690
 your winger then after look is 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.849
 always a little bit of water 1 and after 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.060
 we just put them in a salad bowl 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.799
 so now you can put the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.720
 preparation you want sauce 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.549
 cheese ketchup tomato 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.470
 I will make them traditional te 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:22.330
 to say that I added a little bit of 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.449
 power here I have mixed a little 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.449
 little 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:38.940
 here and add a small hazelnut 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.740
 butter that will melt quietly and 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.590
 I'm going to mix paf 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.590
 that's how you 've seen that 1 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.930
 pasta is really very simple if 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.890
 you have difficulty making 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.390
 things in the kitchen do not hesitate to me 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.510
 ask questions i will make myself a 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.830
 pleasure to make you the video that you 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.380
 pose a problem 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.190
