00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 yes 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.160
 very good totals today and other fifth 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.660
 league day food and two birds 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 euro games on line this time we're going 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 play against bayern and good before 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.689
 nothing to say that if you are first seeing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.119
 that party because you are subscribers 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.650
 mine to use it and go directly to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.939
 beagle channel I will leave here a link 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.919
 in the description also also with the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 direct link to your party since this 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.099
 it's the second leg of the two that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.750
 we have to play for the league and the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 true that makes a complete match 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 but from your channel so I recommend that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.149
 go first to him and subscribe to them 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.609
 If you are not, then come back to this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.690
 video see it good and see how the 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.690
 what sensations have 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.750
 yes, clear 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.699
 an aunt puig who was going to make the changes 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.699
 change information 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.670
 and change and you have to do a lot of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670
 gordon 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.480
 ok i 'm 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480
 how 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.890
 that is, as we have explained 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 the idea that we are playing in face mode 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 face because it's impossible to play in 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.430
 ultimate team we take from the good 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 trying to play to have a match today 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 Monday that is when I'm seeing it in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.030
 the channel and it's impossible because of the shit of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.100
 the list of friends sometimes makes you this 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 limitation but does not enter the shields 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 because we do not dominate very well 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 but we do not have another one so we want 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.810
 play this week so I do not expect anything 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 that is good match and good luck and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.960
 go for it 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.530
 super slow 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.920
 I believe it 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.480
 to start 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.879
 game 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.879
 do not do the others videos 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:28.730
 fuck your blaszikowski the unnamable 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.100
 good for now in the first one that you 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.210
 can take the three points of my field 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.210
 the league was unbeaten 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.950
 I had 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.190

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.459

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.689

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.829

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.579

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.270
