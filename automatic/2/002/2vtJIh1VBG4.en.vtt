my<00:01:57.210> eucalyptus<00:01:57.719> oil<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.710> put<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> tiny<00:01:59.939> bit

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
my eucalyptus oil and I put a tiny bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.770 
my eucalyptus oil and I put a tiny bit
maybe<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.619> much<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:03.000> shea<00:02:03.270> butter<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
maybe like that much of shea butter and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.319 
maybe like that much of shea butter and
I<00:02:04.469> mixed<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> all<00:02:05.070> together<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.030> mixing

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
I mixed it all together so I was mixing

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.040 
I mixed it all together so I was mixing
the<00:02:06.420> liquid<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> then

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the liquid and then

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.780 
the liquid and then
I<00:02:08.110> pour<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.770> liquid<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.190> here<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.700> it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
I pour the liquid in here and it

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.050 
I pour the liquid in here and it
hardened<00:02:10.300> into<00:02:10.510> this<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.950> basically<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.790> just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
hardened into this so basically I just

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.480 
hardened into this so basically I just
get<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.450> much<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.380> rub<00:02:15.010> my<00:02:15.130> fingers

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
get this much of it I rub my fingers

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.630 
get this much of it I rub my fingers
together<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:16.420> night<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.350> then<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.070> put<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.460> on

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
together at night and then I put it on

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
together at night and then I put it on
my<00:02:18.790> edges<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.240> rub<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.500> gives<00:02:20.710> it

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
my edges I rub it in and it gives it

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.950 
my edges I rub it in and it gives it
gives<00:02:21.070> me<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> solid<00:02:21.880> form<00:02:22.240> of<00:02:22.480> doing<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
gives me like a solid form of doing it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.840 
gives me like a solid form of doing it
um<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.070> little<00:02:24.100> bit<00:02:24.370> better<00:02:24.520> for<00:02:24.790> me

sometimes<00:03:55.959> if<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:56.320> really<00:03:56.590> hard<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.610> sits

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
sometimes if it's really hard it sits

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.880 
sometimes if it's really hard it sits
right<00:03:58.480> on<00:03:58.660> your<00:03:58.750> edges<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.350> when<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.739> would

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
right on your edges and when I would

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.860 
right on your edges and when I would
take<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.190> off<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.459> would<00:04:00.520> snatch<00:04:01.090> my<00:04:01.390> edges<00:04:01.690> off

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
take it off it would snatch my edges off

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.050 
take it off it would snatch my edges off
so<00:04:02.440> those<00:04:02.709> were<00:04:02.920> kind<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.250> some<00:04:03.430> setbacks<00:04:03.640> that

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
so those were kind of some setbacks that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.370 
so those were kind of some setbacks that
you<00:04:04.209> guys<00:04:04.360> should<00:04:04.480> probably<00:04:04.600> watch<00:04:04.930> out<00:04:05.170> for

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
you guys should probably watch out for

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.640 
you guys should probably watch out for
so<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.550> prefer<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:07.630> wear<00:04:07.750> half<00:04:08.019> wigs<00:04:08.320> because

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
so I prefer to wear half wigs because

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.560 
so I prefer to wear half wigs because
half<00:04:09.040> legs<00:04:09.310> don't<00:04:09.550> come<00:04:09.880> all<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.239> way<00:04:10.269> up<00:04:10.330> here

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
half legs don't come all the way up here

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.660 
half legs don't come all the way up here
they<00:04:10.690> start<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.260> know<00:04:11.290> back<00:04:11.620> here<00:04:11.920> so<00:04:12.459> that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
they start you know back here so that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.150 
they start you know back here so that
way<00:04:12.880> my<00:04:13.390> edges<00:04:14.200> aren't<00:04:14.410> getting<00:04:14.709> broken<00:04:14.920> off

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
way my edges aren't getting broken off

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.500 
way my edges aren't getting broken off
so<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.880> was<00:04:16.180> one<00:04:16.330> thing<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.539> did<00:04:16.930> kind<00:04:17.109> of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
so that was one thing that did kind of

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.150 
so that was one thing that did kind of
down<00:04:17.720> my<00:04:17.900> growth<00:04:18.170> because<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.740> was<00:04:18.890> snatching

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
down my growth because I was snatching

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.020 
down my growth because I was snatching
snatch<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.180> get<00:04:20.270> out<00:04:21.550> so<00:04:22.550> that's<00:04:22.850> something

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
snatch and get out so that's something

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.480 
snatch and get out so that's something
you<00:04:23.180> should<00:04:23.270> look<00:04:23.540> out<00:04:23.690> for<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.980> you<00:04:25.040> glue

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
you should look out for and if you glue

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.140 
you should look out for and if you glue
your<00:04:25.790> wings<00:04:26.150> on<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:28.160> be<00:04:28.340> disastrous<00:04:28.610> if

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
your wings on that can be disastrous if

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.250 
your wings on that can be disastrous if
you're<00:04:29.270> trying<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.540> grow<00:04:29.660> your<00:04:29.750> edges<00:04:30.110> out

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
you're trying to grow your edges out

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.080 
you're trying to grow your edges out
because<00:04:30.530> sometimes<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> glue<00:04:31.670> can<00:04:31.940> also

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
because sometimes the glue can also

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.030 
because sometimes the glue can also
snatch<00:04:32.450> your<00:04:32.630> edges<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.680> just<00:04:33.890> some<00:04:34.010> things

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
snatch your edges up so just some things

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.330 
snatch your edges up so just some things
to<00:04:34.280> kind<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.550> watch<00:04:34.700> out<00:04:34.850> for<00:04:35.350> but<00:04:36.350> I'm<00:04:37.010> really

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
to kind of watch out for but I'm really

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.720 
to kind of watch out for but I'm really
happy<00:04:37.610> with<00:04:37.940> my<00:04:38.050> results<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.830> course<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.490> still

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
happy with my results of course I still

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.150 
happy with my results of course I still
have<00:04:40.880> work<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.270> go<00:04:41.720> because<00:04:42.140> it's<00:04:42.410> not<00:04:42.620> as<00:04:42.830> full

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
have work to go because it's not as full

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.190 
have work to go because it's not as full
as<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:43.430> should<00:04:43.730> be<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.600> know<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.110> I

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
as it should be but I know that if I

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.190 
as it should be but I know that if I
keep<00:04:45.440> using<00:04:45.710> um<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.880> things<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.300> use<00:04:47.510> and

keep using um the things that I use and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.230 
keep using um the things that I use and
patience<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.830> time<00:04:49.070> it'll<00:04:49.430> grow<00:04:49.790> just<00:04:50.090> like

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
patience and time it'll grow just like

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.450 
patience and time it'll grow just like
hair<00:04:50.570> grows<00:04:50.810> it'll<00:04:51.080> grow<00:04:51.320> back<00:04:51.590> um<00:04:52.010> if<00:04:52.400> you

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
hair grows it'll grow back um if you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.250 
hair grows it'll grow back um if you
