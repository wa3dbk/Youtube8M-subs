00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
the mound okay and that toes turned

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.910 
the mound okay and that toes turned
slightly<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.030> right<00:03:07.269> okay<00:03:07.900> now<00:03:08.170> start<00:03:08.799> in

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
slightly to the right okay now start in

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.310 
slightly to the right okay now start in
your<00:03:09.040> load<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.579> point<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.329> emphasis<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:10.989> we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
your load a point of emphasis is that we

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.349 
your load a point of emphasis is that we
want<00:03:11.590> her<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.829> start<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.400> load<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.150> she's

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
want her to start in that load so she's

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.080 
want her to start in that load so she's
using<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.959> ground<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.590> power<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.640> when<00:03:15.850> she's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
using the ground for power so when she's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.479 
using the ground for power so when she's
driving<00:03:16.630> out<00:03:16.810> she's<00:03:17.560> staying<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.160> contact

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
driving out she's staying in contact

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.740 
driving out she's staying in contact
with<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.090> ground<00:03:19.329> okay<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.200> she<00:03:20.739> over<00:03:21.160> strides

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
with the ground okay if she over strides

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.000 
with the ground okay if she over strides
typically<00:03:22.750> what<00:03:22.900> will<00:03:23.019> happen<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.620> she'll<00:03:23.859> be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
typically what will happen is she'll be

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.280 
typically what will happen is she'll be
coming<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.450> foot<00:03:25.750> will<00:03:25.930> leave<00:03:26.140> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
coming up and this foot will leave the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.229 
coming up and this foot will leave the
ground<00:03:26.560> which<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:26.950> illegal<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:27.730> need<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.060> keep

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
ground which is illegal we need to keep

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.430 
ground which is illegal we need to keep
the<00:03:28.450> foot<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.810> contact<00:03:29.049> with<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> ground<00:03:29.880> go

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the foot in contact with the ground go

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
the foot in contact with the ground go
good<00:03:32.440> very<00:03:32.859> nice<00:03:33.040> good<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.690> again<00:03:34.959> okay

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
good very nice good do it again okay

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.630 
good very nice good do it again okay
load<00:03:35.799> load<00:03:36.310> load<00:03:36.340> go<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:39.220> one<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.459> got<00:03:39.579> a

make<00:03:42.489> sure<00:03:42.700> we're<00:03:42.910> focusing<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:43.780> drill

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
make sure we're focusing in this drill

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.830 
make sure we're focusing in this drill
the<00:03:44.859> fundamental<00:03:45.519> here<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.359> technique

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
the fundamental here and the technique

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.770 
the fundamental here and the technique
is<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.079> we<00:03:48.069> want<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:48.970> contact<00:03:49.209> with

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
is that we want to be in contact with

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.040 
is that we want to be in contact with
the<00:03:49.930> ground<00:03:50.139> okay

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
the ground okay

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.260 
the ground okay
it's<00:03:51.440> not<00:03:51.680> about<00:03:51.830> driving<00:03:52.400> out<00:03:52.520> as<00:03:52.670> far<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.090> we

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
it's not about driving out as far as we

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.750 
it's not about driving out as far as we
can<00:03:53.480> it's<00:03:53.810> about<00:03:54.200> staying<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.920> contact<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
can it's about staying in contact and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.370 
can it's about staying in contact and
driving<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.720> go<00:03:57.230> ahead<00:03:58.900> go<00:03:59.900> nice<00:04:00.860> good
