also<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.060> walk<00:02:35.180> off<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> Stanford<00:02:35.930> if

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
also going to walk off the Stanford if

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.100 
also going to walk off the Stanford if
you<00:02:36.819> don't<00:02:37.819> clean<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.150> you're<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> get<00:02:39.050> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
you don't clean it you're going to get a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.710 
you don't clean it you're going to get a
buildup<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.680> polish<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.580> then<00:02:41.209> your<00:02:41.390> design

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
buildup of polish and then your design

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.840 
buildup of polish and then your design
is<00:02:41.959> not<00:02:41.989> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.800> clear<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.890> sharp<00:02:45.890> as

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
is not going to be as clear and sharp as

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:56.050 
is not going to be as clear and sharp as
you<00:02:47.540> would<00:02:47.959> like<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.680> be<00:02:50.380> so<00:02:51.380> polish

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.130 

scrape<00:02:56.959> again<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:58.220> great<00:02:58.870> pick<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.020> with

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
scrape again it's great pick it up with

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.050 
scrape again it's great pick it up with
your<00:03:00.260> stamp<00:03:01.030> signs<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.300> they're<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.970> to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
your stamp signs on they're going to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.880 
your stamp signs on they're going to
line<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.300> up<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.860> go<00:03:07.580> straight<00:03:08.569> across<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:11.890> feel

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
line it up and go straight across I feel

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.860 
line it up and go straight across I feel
bad<00:03:13.099> because<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.790> can't<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:14.180> see<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.690> very

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
bad because you can't really see it very

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.620 
bad because you can't really see it very
clearly<00:03:14.989> but<00:03:15.849> like<00:03:16.849> i<00:03:16.970> said<00:03:17.000> i<00:03:17.209> will<00:03:17.450> put

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
clearly but like i said i will put

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.809

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
to see it better but this shows you the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:33.190 
to see it better but this shows you the
technique<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.790> how<00:03:25.910> easy<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:32.200> i'll

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
technique and really how easy it is i'll

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.979 
technique and really how easy it is i'll
probably<00:03:33.530> order<00:03:33.950> my<00:03:34.569> polishes<00:03:35.569> within<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
probably order my polishes within the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.250 
probably order my polishes within the
next<00:03:36.370> day<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.760> hopefully<00:03:38.630> have<00:03:38.959> them<00:03:39.140> by<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
next day and hopefully have them by the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.050 
next day and hopefully have them by the
end<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.560> next<00:03:39.620> week<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.430> i<00:03:40.580> can<00:03:40.760> do<00:03:40.849> some

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
end of next week and then i can do some

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.500 
end of next week and then i can do some
more<00:03:41.239> tutorials<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.170> some<00:03:43.010> designs<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:44.090> i

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
more tutorials on some designs that i

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.680 
more tutorials on some designs that i
think<00:03:44.930> we're<00:03:45.260> better<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:47.239> special

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
think we're better with the the special

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.320 
think we're better with the the special
polish<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.620> for<00:03:49.099> this<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.519> Y<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.760> really

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
polish but for this the Y is really

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.680 
polish but for this the Y is really
working<00:03:50.540> well<00:03:50.930> I'm<00:03:51.860> excited<00:03:52.310> cuz<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.330> wasn't

working well I'm excited cuz I wasn't

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:05.140 
working well I'm excited cuz I wasn't
sure<00:03:53.870> how<00:03:54.049> I<00:03:54.080> would<00:03:54.260> look<00:03:58.599> over<00:03:59.599> your<00:03:59.690> nail<00:04:04.150> you

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.710 
can see where some of the polish is kind
of<00:04:06.920> hanging<00:04:07.130> off<00:04:07.370> right<00:04:07.519> there<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.329> fix

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
pointer finger again you can just go

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.370 
pointer finger again you can just go
over<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.000> lightly<00:05:08.270> with<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.780> nail<00:05:08.960> polish

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
remover actually that took it off it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.420 
remover actually that took it off it
uneven<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:12.470> will<00:05:12.710> not<00:05:12.860> mess<00:05:13.070> up<00:05:13.250> your

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430

polish but it will take off the top
layer<00:05:15.949> which<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.789> design<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:17.539> that's

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
layer which is the design so that's

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.510 
layer which is the design so that's
really<00:05:18.139> handy<00:05:18.470> if<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:18.800> stopped<00:05:19.070> in<00:05:19.190> my<00:05:19.310> whole

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
really handy if I stopped in my whole

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.879 
really handy if I stopped in my whole
hand<00:05:19.729> in<00:05:20.260> less<00:05:21.260> than<00:05:22.360> four<00:05:23.360> minutes<00:05:23.479> so<00:05:24.470> that's

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
hand in less than four minutes so that's

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.180 
hand in less than four minutes so that's
really<00:05:25.340> quick<00:05:25.669> okay<00:05:27.430> clean<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:28.580> off<00:05:28.789> again

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
really quick okay clean this off again

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.540 
really quick okay clean this off again
and<00:05:31.539> this<00:05:32.539> dries<00:05:32.960> almost<00:05:33.650> immediately

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
and this dries almost immediately

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.350 
and this dries almost immediately
