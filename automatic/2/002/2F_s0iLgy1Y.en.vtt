00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good plan will return this one here and 7 and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 today I looked into the world not to eat 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.000
 refuse 6 these are such funny mobs 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.509
 with which you can do different things as well, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.429
 Well made up of life like this 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.410
 fine slug we have but 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 today we will mock him but 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.880
 the ways are fine in general we will be something with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 im doing the first thing i do that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'll freeze me there is such a snowball 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 called freeze meaning it means 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.810
 freeze but throw 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.610
 them in life and after a while he does 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.050
 should be born well what would go 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.450
 froze us now appears here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 such a unit to reduce if we can not do 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 different things but you need to take 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.770
 crate this frame and rename slime 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.140
 in the number from unit to 3 here we are 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 here by name 1 and now 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.449
 but if we put well in different places 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 let's come here and put it down below 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.500
 tears of size 1 appear 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.270
 Such a network will appear at a broken laptop 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 the mat broke okay now we 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 freeze here and now we can now 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.340
 freeze and these are now already consider 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 three three blocks of mucus is so cool and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.170
 jumping in general let's take one more 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 timeframe and rename for example by two 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 a gun let's three and then you can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 will transmit 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.259
 we can take three in general from different 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.500
 parties to approach that garbage here we are already 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.430
 2 sizes it is such a serious find 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.299
 slug will now appear than a lot 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.439
 assholes us atlan 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:47.210
 we collect mucus and I already wanted to operate 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:50.399
 frame okay size 3 and fit set and 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.189
 here we are in the third size of slugs 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.430
 let's kill him that way you can 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.530
 Spawning slugs of different sizes here 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.280
 so come on now melted whole 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.329
 army of these slugs let's take 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.619
 more so cool we have blocks 1 2 3 4 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.140
 5 4 3 blocks plan it and let's let 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:22.870
 they will all be size 3 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:28.850
 let's three really all 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:32.390
 a half x n and the distant village oh yeah 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.740
 these like this okay could here slugs 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:41.480
 die and we see salute in general so 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.280
 dying last merge let's go like this 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.590
 well we can not mock 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.530
 slugs in maikrafte and now tell 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.840
 how is it done let's start with what we can 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 we are testing what is in the frame for 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.330
 this we take the frame we insert there 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 something renamed for example in 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.700
 in my case it will be a chair called 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 meaning 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.550
 and here we shove here then we put 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.590
 team blood write eat to third 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.519
 page and timeframe because 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.970
 one frame 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.170
 write these two quotes click dam and all 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.180
 now activating this command and we 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.459
 displayed here is such a team here 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.350
 which speaks of all her give away tags 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.670
 and we only need an inscription which 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.489
 goes up to this drubchen 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.489
 this command is not that is this effect 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.430
 which tells us about the subject which 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.680
 is inside the frame here it is we 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.010
 we copy it we close we enter 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.700
 command block act one time frame and 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.980
 generally leave it here and if everything 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.519
 the same then we have to light up 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.920
 no signal then it will not be played 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.239
 general regarding this i did here 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.750
 such a chain which if found by this 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.540
 frame we need a scoreboard and therefore 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.140
 what I was giving a scoreboard they just did 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.900
 these are the signals if for example 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.750
 it is a unit of value then it means a in and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.000
 timeframe is slime title 1 and 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.549
 if from her in on a certain 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.019
 the coordinates is the block itself then in these 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.479
 same concreta hua 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.590
 put the air well i mean if here 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.720
 was his block 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.520
 yes where is my blog here we put the block 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.650
 set here and timeframe only 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.949
 shove here on at 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.080
 r 100 axes find here its block 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.750
 we put air from a guy here 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.509
 and slugs so let's show you where 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.130
 my slime renamed his unit 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.990
 because in a different way no works 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.220
 it will be because they also saw 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.100
 it is even the name 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.080
 here get do not forget to remove everything here 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.889
 inscriptions dpr goats because it happens 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.930
 brings just clean everything here and then 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.960
 Click here and here you need memory 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.180
 us slime and we freeze that's how 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.490
 freeze lure is very simple this here 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.479
 this command block in my 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 but in general if there is a snowball in the world 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.240
 then in radius, that's what Ebola gave birth to 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.000
 and two taste these slimes are killed 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.180
 here and with the same she this month we 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.139
 Samples are put and therefore dies and 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.570
 become your blog all just to do 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.270
 potions that will kill limes and 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.479
 then fireworks will be launched 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:29.020
 i also used the institute command then 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.389
 we have a potion we throw it at 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.789
 This product has certain effects. 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.860
 which made with the teams that is 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.520
 This effect is necessary on 120 meters is not easy 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.260
 clicking on 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.860
 the effect of the word above that here on the potion 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.099
 or unscrew the fact that in my view of the text 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.370
 127 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.680
 if we test and have mobs 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.460
 this effect us was 7 something relatively 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.860
 we remembered him fireworks were killing him 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.380
 and so it was so easy to kill a bunch 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.409
 slugs let's even somewhere there easily 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.860
 so here's the case and let's just remember 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.960
 a bunch of frames and I'll show you what it is 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.740
 really looks pretty cool 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.260
 if you still put the night at all priests 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.680
 how many layers and so let's put 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.680
 night 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:28.790
 and if we run a gazelle it should 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.790
 look cool okay how cool 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.530
 Well, I hope this 5 you 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.449
 liked she brought you some 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.750
 favor yes we learned a lot with lime and 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:18.889
 which you can scoff everyone thanks 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.889
