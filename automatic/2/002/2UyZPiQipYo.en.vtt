 of the german alliance he draws 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.190
 especially through his political 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.869
 skills and his diplomacy 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.789
 his memory was therefore merely 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.259
 the logical conclusion as the main goal 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.450
 the restoration of the nation 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.550
 trading in tamriel is where she herself 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.759
 the ruler over the ruby throne 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.830
 emmerick applies in civil high royalty 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.320
 as an orphan leader but also as 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.270
 merciless to his fine ones 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.459
 strategy consists of its opponents 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.319
 scare and scare by 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.940
 their army settled down with tent and only 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.319
 few of them are left alive by the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.319
 events can report 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.810
 the cartridges are the dominant ones 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.430
 rattled by fall alliance once 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.900
 they would be ruled by the high elves 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.510
 causing a mixture of the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.610
 blood both races came through this 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.770
 have high fish blood in their veins 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.479
 the bretons have an innate understanding 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.640
 of magic and also one 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 by contrast, natural protection 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.570
 they are in the so called threshing skin 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 able to absorb magic 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.170
 In addition, the members of the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.270
 Breton people sent in the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.270
 alchemy and the art of enchanting 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.810
 once the red ones lived on the continent 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.390
 better known today as a sunken person 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.490
 continent due to their origin contributed 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.760
 They originally named Jordan 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.050
 but when they fled their country 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.640
 Some of them settled in today 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.970
 Hemmer fell down and called himself 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 henceforth, it was worth settling down 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.870
 but not bloodless 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.940
 At that time there was always a club of the orks and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.740
 dominates the area the red white 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.400
 were forced to take their place first 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.650
 win 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.210
 It is not out of this tradition 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.620
 amazing that both men and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.660
 also women dealing with weapons 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 be formed what a big 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.750
 difference to the other peoples 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.280
 Temple depicts where women 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.980
 comparatively rarely the war 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.780
 pursue a trade 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.640
 Today the red are among the best 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.740
 war temmels and put the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.480
 largest participant field they distrust 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.940
 any form of nadine and lay 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.760
 great value on honor would be and worship 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 outwardly they draw the divine 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.940
 through her dark and often 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 tattooed and pierced the skin 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.540
 as well as by your ability even in 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.200
 desert similar areas easily 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.200
 to be able to survive 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.340
 originally the orks were part of the people 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.260
 the old mill they worshiped the war god 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.780
 strini mack until this one of the low 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.550
 princeton where he was eaten this 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.739
 before the trailer training max 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.060
 into what we know today by means of 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.700
 she from the rest of the old he 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.680
 therefore were scorned and marginalized 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.760
 the orks fled and settled in whole 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.190
 the real down 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 nowadays they live mainly in 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.620
 Armenia 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.019
 They worship the Danish prince 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.489
 malakhov and follow its laws 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.500
 honor for personal strengths 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.480
 foreground and theft and 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.980
 strictly forbid unauthorized violence 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.510
 with them the rule of the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.959
 stronger what they dreaded 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.000
 warriors and dangerous enemies 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.799
 but torx does not just mean wild ones 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 Armor and weapons are all Tamriel 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.019
 as the best and your blacksmithing 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.790
 is appreciated quality everywhere 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.709
 in contrast to this is the magic of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.289
 Orks she is peoples of the other 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.579
 considered wild and unpredictable 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.320
 This reason she was also from the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.449
 magician guild excluded and even 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.740
 prohibited and their use punishable 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.630
 put this 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.550
 classes form the average alliance 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.930
 in the northwest tamriel that is 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.979
 probably the traditionalist 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.050
 the alliances 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.729
 but the once hostile peoples are 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.770
 united under a banner by the 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.720
 poverty and the suffering of the decay 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.180
 the trade routes have kept moving 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.360
 to underestimate them would be a fatal one 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.360
 error 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.940
 the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.950
 with today's t chest and the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.990
 Overview of the average alliance 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.660
 The next issue will continue 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.780
 with the life heart pact to the next 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.780
 times 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.020
 With
