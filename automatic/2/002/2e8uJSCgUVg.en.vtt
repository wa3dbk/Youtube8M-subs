00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.039
 and greet people it's black swan 332 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.750
 today we are not in a kit 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.849
 test video of a new one of a new 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.820
 objects that I bought today 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 by the way so a headset a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.579
 plantronics the gamecom 380 I'm doing a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 kiss here we are so plan while they 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 me a brand of gaming so here 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 the case here that's it so it's with a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.579
 connection to 2 we say 2003 2 x 3 5 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.070
 mm so that's hooking up with a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:06.280
 micro thing here it's the listener and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 So here is a very good helmet 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.540
 frankly I tried it the microphone is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.660
 really great so it's a microphone 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 that you can be normal he does not want to 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.950
 come off against finally I have no I 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.040
 not tried rubbish that's what's 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.210
 small enough and that's good it's here you 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.380
 see there are small ones 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.420
 degrees in orange 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.800
 so that is to say that you can when 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.080
 you put on your helmet you find 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.430
 a good position and then you 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.810
 look inside tell you by 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.960
 example 60 degrees is so now 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.630
 I have each time you can use 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.000
 Finally, every time you will know where to go 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.240
 to have the best position 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.539
 possible from the microphone so the headphones get 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.450
 also put in prison like that I 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:55.360
 believe that I get to a moissac hand 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.800
 difficult ok that's good because there is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.970
 it's difficult because a little clip 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.110
 if if you see the two arrows when 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.119
 they are horizontal well for good 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.179
 aligned it's a little clip so you 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.009
 can it's hard enough to remove that it's 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.870
 well it's because it's like that 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:14.810
 it's not too flexible the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.640
 what are the name of the auricles 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.049
 Fabric 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.940
 it was very comfortable it does not hurt 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.709
 ears to ears it's a small 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.190
 little hot we want tunes and a little 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.849
 little by little and that's it for 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.230
 this is pure will view of these headphones I 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.579
 waiting for you right on my computer 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.280
 with the test so we're back on my 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.010
 so I'm using 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.739
 so you can see that the microphone of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.230
 very good qualities of a good are 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.110
 clear so I wanted to frequency 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.460
 cDU 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.310
 then from 100 hertz to needle km 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.040
 so that's a good frequency for a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.180
 micro frankly especially to make some 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.590
 videos it's not a microphone either 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.600
 so singing frankly if I have a microphone 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.570
 advise you a good headset 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.260
 km hour with a price frankly not the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.540
 all abusive 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.820
 I'm going to buy so I said no I 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.300
 do not know if I say today I have him 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.790
 bought 30 euros and frankly for this 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.540
 price we expect shit a little bit for 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.650
 speak well because audio costs 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 finally how dear so frankly 15 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.380
 once I say frankly I believe 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.989
 take it this is the only thing that I do you 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.890
 say it's frankly it's really 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.530
 very very good 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.630
 he really has good and that's 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 really good quality for really 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.160
 of breaking a derisory price so buy 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.660
 that's all for me 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.400
 I hope I would have helped you 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.720
 choose your headset if you 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.570
 want to change or if you want to 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.550
 buy one simply 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.550
 on this I tell you to + TV you well
