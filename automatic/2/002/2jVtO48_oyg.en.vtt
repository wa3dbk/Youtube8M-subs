00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello I'm blond comics and you do not have to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
 calibrate your screen or clean your 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.010
 glasses or anything I'm fat was always 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 trying to hide it but I give you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.080
 many you are not suspecting so that you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.859
 he clarified if I'm fat but short by 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.750
 what I have are great and the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 only genes that concern me only 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 have meets mom I'm a fat person 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 fat or be a coarse of the truth of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
 those who spend three weeks without knowing 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.820
 how much of hitting so because you have to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 wait for the new tape to arrive 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 of the ies perez apart issue being fat is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.280
 very difficult because it is because it is short 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.170
 it's a flaw that they look clear well in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.260
 a society that the broths impose on you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
 of beauty that does not fulfill that I send it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 from the fat man who lives knowing that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.050
 the people trying to tell you nothing that you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 can offend whenever they speak 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 communicate add as with rodeos with you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.340
 I have puts with the fat ones you put on 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.380
 surround them 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.350
 there is one thing that people do not know and it is 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.910
 which is the fat one and has its advantages 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.739
 example no one is ever going to ask you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.000
 because it always leads to throwing anyone 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.650
 it's going to seem weird that they eat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 edges of the pizzas and best of all 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.910
 is that your achievements in love are more 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.130
 valued because everyone thinks 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.780
 who fucks for your personality when 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.430
 really leagues for that photo in plane 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.229
 chopped up here that you got 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.820
 years ago for value but do you 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.050
 I come to talk about this today because 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.390
 I want to stop being a goal 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.150
 Being fat is making my life a 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.460
 hell I do not say it I just have friends 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.990
 I do not leave home, I 've noticed 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.450
 that being fat made me isolate myself 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.790
 as how I eat a lot is 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 passion and I've noticed and this has 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.840
 to finish clear is like when it leaves you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.520
 your girlfriend who starts to realize 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.110
 all the truths the other day I gave myself 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 I realized that if I have more life 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.920
 socially that I and that living next to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 the capulets that are edges of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.340
 shit doing record tally that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.320
 my last four girlfriends went by the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.850
 house you hear are original relationships 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.430
 because they're always going out with someone 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.800
 which has a name in number or a 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.360
 bar low one at and in between and then 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.960
 aside I remembered that the stories more 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.729
 worthy 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.280
 that the last six have happened to me 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.630
 months have been all plays clearer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.549
 put on my skin my friends more 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.350
 inseparable do not play magic like a 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.500
 explains that someone a cartoon of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.450
 those then in addition to less than 140 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.130
 characters is a roll but let's go 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 I'm dieting on a real diet of the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.440
 you start even if it's not Monday I've 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.440
 lowered already 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 88 times the stairs of my house and not 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.280
 I know in fact today go buy the bread and 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.720
 I realized that most of the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.210
 neighbors who know me for a lifetime 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.490
 they did not stop looking at me as if to 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.030
 know if I was really not I think that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.260
 my radical change has been so brutal 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.510
 that they have not even noticed us 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.000
 wears pants but good people eyes 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.100
 because I was pointing to an ignacio and what 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.930
 I have been in the whatsapp I have 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.960

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.020
 put the on the arm to be there and put 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.650
 the mobile to listen to music while 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.300

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.800

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.769

 chocolatina gym and views of the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.129

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.629
 to the gym even if I had put the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.980
