Bowl<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:21.200> there<00:02:21.590> were<00:02:21.709> faces<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.489> your<00:02:22.610> rivals

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
Bowl if there were faces of your rivals

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.479

on<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> pins<00:02:23.930> well<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.799> gotta<00:02:25.010> go<00:02:25.129> with<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> few

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
of the Penguins I guess the archrival

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.740 
of the Penguins I guess the archrival
would<00:02:27.799> be<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> Crosby<00:02:28.310> Mulligan<00:02:29.030> James<00:02:29.569> the

87<00:02:33.829> would<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.099> on<00:02:34.220> there

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.470 
87 would be on there
and<00:02:35.930> I'd<00:02:36.319> probably<00:02:36.500> Bowl<00:02:36.920> 300<00:02:37.549> if<00:02:38.000> Cardinal

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
and I'd probably Bowl 300 if Cardinal

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.809 
and I'd probably Bowl 300 if Cardinal
gets<00:02:38.660> traded<00:02:38.930> I've<00:02:39.200> put<00:02:39.739> his<00:02:39.890> face<00:02:40.130> maybe<00:02:40.579> if
