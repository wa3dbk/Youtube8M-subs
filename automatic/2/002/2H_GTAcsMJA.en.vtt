00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
below that you're going to make a line

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.120 
below that you're going to make a line
of<00:01:22.390> seven<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.110> should<00:01:23.380> get<00:01:23.590> a<00:01:23.650> little

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
create a triangle don't fill it in but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.820 
create a triangle don't fill it in but
basically<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.690> create<00:01:40.230> that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
basically you're going to create that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.020
