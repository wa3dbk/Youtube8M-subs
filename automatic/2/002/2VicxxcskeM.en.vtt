mission<00:01:29.619> well<00:01:30.219> why<00:01:30.609> would<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:30.969> try<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.210> tackle

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
mission well why would you try to tackle

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.200 
mission well why would you try to tackle
the<00:01:31.840> guy<00:01:32.020> from<00:01:32.229> above<00:01:32.560> while<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.100> can<00:01:33.310> just<00:01:33.549> do

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
the guy from above while you can just do

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.879 
the guy from above while you can just do
the<00:01:34.390> more<00:01:34.600> efficient<00:01:35.109> way<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:35.469> chase<00:01:35.740> him

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889
