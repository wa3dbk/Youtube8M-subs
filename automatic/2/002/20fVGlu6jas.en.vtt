over there the the running track itself
that's<00:02:07.140> finished<00:02:07.470> now<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.650> know<00:02:07.770> there's<00:02:07.950> been

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that's finished now I know there's been

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
that's finished now I know there's been
a<00:02:08.100> few<00:02:08.280> setbacks<00:02:08.490> there<00:02:09.060> obviously<00:02:09.660> where

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
a few setbacks there obviously where

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.270 
a few setbacks there obviously where
they<00:02:10.020> didn't<00:02:10.289> help

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
they didn't help

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.949 
they didn't help
they'll<00:02:11.670> also<00:02:11.850> build<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> grandstand

they'll also build in the grandstand
over<00:02:13.320> there<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:14.040> don't<00:02:14.220> look<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.490> far

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
