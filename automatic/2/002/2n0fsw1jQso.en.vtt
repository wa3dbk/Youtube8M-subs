hopefully they come out something new
for<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:47.940> otherwise<00:00:48.239> YouTube<00:00:48.870> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
for that because otherwise YouTube is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
for that because otherwise YouTube is
going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> look<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.350> bland<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
going to look very bland all the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
going to look very bland all the
channels<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.890> with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
channels are going to the same just with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.670 
channels are going to the same just with
different<00:00:53.340> colors<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.180> had<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.440> hope<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
different colors I had a little hope for

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
different colors I had a little hope for
the<00:00:55.920> 2<00:00:56.070> point<00:00:56.280> 0<00:00:56.399> channels<00:00:56.789> when<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> saw<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the 2 point 0 channels when I saw this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
the 2 point 0 channels when I saw this
large<00:00:57.690> rectangle<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.010> was

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
large rectangle right here that was

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
large rectangle right here that was
completely<00:00:59.609> empty<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> went<00:01:00.690> ahead<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
completely empty so I went ahead and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.599 
completely empty so I went ahead and
messed<00:01:01.500> around<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.859> back<00:01:02.039> around<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> few<00:01:02.550> times

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
messed around my back around a few times

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.179 
messed around my back around a few times
and<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.420> noticed<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.439> isn't<00:01:04.799> even

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and I noticed that that isn't even

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
and I noticed that that isn't even
transparent<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.689> backgrounds<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.560> go
