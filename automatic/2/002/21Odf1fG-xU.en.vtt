00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.620
 they are members of the church but are more dead than alive 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.410
 this warmth 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.330
 makes people take the bible but do not feel a vibration in the 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.969
 heart do not have joy of your life do not vibrate with the word of God there 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.290
 Many people who call themselves Christians but have already died a long time ago 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.949
 you say you are seeing me you are spiritually dead 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.669
 wake up friend 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.400
 Jesus can resurrect theo today 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800
 wake up later 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.410
 because jesus is coming back 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.449
 and you need to be prepared 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.859
 for that great day 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.649
 agree with me 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.759
 the warmth 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370
 is in apocalypse 3 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.230
 that you neither cold nor hot are warm 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.630
 this is a sign of the door of Christ 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.620
 and even more 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.820
 in matteo chapter 24 persian the 24 lemos 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.060
 because false christs will arise 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 and false prophets and they will do great signs and wonders 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.140
 in such a way that they will cheat if possible 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 even the chosen ones 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740
 he knows from time to time someone appears 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.370
 in the united states in brazil 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.430
 people there concentrated 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.040
 long beard long hair saying I am christ 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.470
 And I do not know 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.290
 from you comic tic 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.710
 those men do not even know the bible 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.810
 they are saying and that they are Christ 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 and in this and that already and others there who are false prophets who use the bible 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.990
 to deceive people 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.079
 to take money from people to exploit people is doing 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.579
 of false prophets 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.630
 but be careful with those people 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.420
 follow what the Bible says do not follow man 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.580
 because Jesus said 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 cursed that he who trusts in man 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 Jeremiah 17 verse 5 are signs 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.530
 of the end of time 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.370
 false prophets will arise 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.300
 false christs 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.670
 doing wonders and miracles 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 to deceive people 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.909
 the other sign of the coming of Christ was the darkening of the sun and the moon 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.260
 that occurred on May 19, 1780 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.250
 the sun darkened in broad daylight 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.370
 and the moon appeared red as blood 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 the other sign is the fall of the stars 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 as it says Matteo 24 Persian the 29 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.899
 that happened one day November 13, 1833 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.439
 this happened in the united states of america and also in europe and 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.389
 several places in the world 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.290
 the stars began to fall 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.279
 close to eleven thirty at night red-hot stars meteorites 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.349
 in large quantity 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.439
 as if it were the end of the world 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.489
 but it was not 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.929
 in one more signal 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.069
 of the coming of Jesus 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.889
 wars 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.269
 Herbs and rumors of wars 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.800
 in the First World War 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.229
 20 million people died 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.379
 in the Second World War 50 million people died 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.649
 there is also the Korean conflict the vietnam war 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.429
 the war between Iran and Iraq 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:55.939
 the war in Indochina 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.939
 of Algeria from Bosnia the war of the Malvinas 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.910
 the war of afghanistan 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.440
 and the most recent between the United States and Iraq that problem of terrorism 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.619
 Herbs and rumors of wars 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:08.969
 the 20th century 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.549
 it was the bloodiest of all 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.999
 in the 21st century 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.759
 we have already started 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.889
 witnessing a war broadcast live 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.569
 for global network television 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.070
 It's not the end of the world 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.039
 with certainty is 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.969
 and so 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.790
 we witness the famous September 11 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 is not true 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.610
 when those hijacked planes collided with the twin towers in the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.920
 Isle of Manhattan in the United States 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.309
 killing thousands of people 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.309
 that event was marked in the memory of all human beings 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.399
 but not only that 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.269
 retaliation 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.430
 American revenge those 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.899
 to those countries supposedly 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.720
 involved in the war 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.249
 and so simple people 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:55.809
 ordinary people 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.179
 children and women 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:59.680
 they were wrapped 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.049
 in these terrible wars 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.150
 Safely 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.759
 we can witness 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.900
 the signs 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.739
 of the coming of Jesus 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.749
 Jesus is returning to my son 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.919
 soon 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.109
 Christ will appear in the clouds of heaven 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.499
 and the bible warns us 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.779
 the bible says that false christs will arise to the devil 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.180
 will try to imitate the coming of Christ 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.190
 the san mateo chapter 24 persian twenty-seven 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.860
 it's written so if they told you look it's in the desert do not leave or 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310
 look is in the rooms do not believe it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.950
 the devil is going to try to imitate the coming of Christ 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.330
 but what this will have in the clouds of the heavens 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.389
 and everything with what he will say 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.499
 he will come 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.050
 in a visible way 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.180
 the day but when it appears there 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.889
 imitating the coming of Christ 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.130
 the earth band 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.870
 will do some miracles out there 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.220
 and will not be seen by everyone at the same time except for television 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.379
 but this is wrong jesus will appear in the clouds of heaven 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.789
 everything with lopera 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.210
 and Jesus is not going to step on the earth 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.750
 let's see some details 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.099
 important 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.529
 details 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.969
 about the coming of Jesus 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.020
 come with me who this reasoning 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.009
 first when jesus turn 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.849
 When Jesus returns 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.760
 he will come in a body 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.089
 visible 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.069
 second 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.780
 in the clouds of the heavens 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.580
 third 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.069
 with all the angels 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:27.930
 quarter 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.210
 all toy 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.240
 fifth will not tread the earth 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.139
 and sixth 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.639
 will come with power 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.110
 and many brides 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.800

 kondo jesus will return 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.520
 William Miller said that Jesus would return in 1844 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.689
 but Jesus did not come 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:49.449
 later the watchtower society said that jesus would come in 1914 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.759
 but Jesus did not come either 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.360
 it was the first world war 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.250
 after the father cicero 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.490
 father cicero de juazeiro 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.879
 and the stretches 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:58.810
 they said 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.080
 what military gara 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.860
 and from 2000 it will not happen 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.770
 They made a lot of mistakes and the thousand have already passed and since the year 2000 we are in the 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.099
 2005 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.680
 and Jesus did not come 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.499
 and what Jesus himself said 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.789
 Jesus said the day and the time nobody knows 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.330
 why go back to Jesus 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.460
 to find those who accepted him as a personal savior 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.700
 what a bless 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.440
 second 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.650
 to end the suffering 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.500
 third 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.240
 to catch satan 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.210
 the fourth 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.210
 to establish his eternal kingdom 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:38.619
 and what will happen when Jesus returns 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:40.529
 there will be the death of the wicked 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.610
 there will be the rapture and transformation of the righteous 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.599
 there will be resurrection of those who died in Christ 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.669
 everything on earth will be destroyed 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.110
 and the earth will be empty and dark 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.110
 For a thousand years 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.129
 necessary 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:59.059
 understand not only this 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.960
 but it is necessary to understand more 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.550
 join me now in the final part of this important study - with vigo por 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.510
 now you know 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.449
 as will be 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:09.990
 the coming of Jesus 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.879
 and he also knows how careful he must be with the false Christs 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.419
 the false prophets 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.999
 So what are the steps you must take to be prepared for the 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.949
 coming of Jesus 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.309
 There are five steps 

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:22.449
 come with me 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.300
 the first step that you should give 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.650
 the first decision is to study the sacred bible 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.129
 and are you doing it 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:31.250
 second step 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.490
 accept Jesus as personal savior and this you have already done 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.610
 third step accept 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.610
 keeping the ten commandments 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.210
 I believe that this also lies all that 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.229
 fourth step be baptized 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.179
 be baptized in the true church 

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:50.610
 and the last step 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.970
 remain firm in faith 

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.889
 pace what happens 

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.449
 until the end 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.069
 repeating 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.779
 Study the Bible Accept Jesus Save the Ten Commandments 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.580
 be baptized 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.909
 and remain firm in faith 

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.789
 would like to take all those steps 

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:11.550
 with certainty that yes 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.889
 Jesus is going back in the clouds of the 100
