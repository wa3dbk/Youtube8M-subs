00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:13.500
 Hello, I 'm going to see you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 laroche-joubert then good memory of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.139
 Christmas 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.720
 listen does not hold of childhood but to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 adult age finally when it's me who 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 started to throw Christmas 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.609
 because in the family we were not 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.439
 very talented and so had to start at little 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.849
 almost it lasts about ten years and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 I had a very special Christmas there 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 three years where for the first time I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.920
 reunited the entire match then the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 earth was my family's not 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.739
 like the whole event ie 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.510
 I have a family completely 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 not recomposed that children you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.399
 propose my wholesale starts to this 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 time she had family 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.440
 traditional now robert cousin 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.930
 and it gets complicated at the level of my 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 parents may well love my dad well 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 do not look bad she's on the side of my 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 mother oddly and her second husband 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 since you are leaving your first husband and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.149
 then the brothers and my brothers 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410
 has one that comes from mom's side and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.449
 three others that come from the side of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.900
 papin but dad side level if his 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.189
 second firewoman is no longer but there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.430
 had like the children of his second 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.770
 women 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 and then there was his third wife 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 who was there too with the last time 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.310
 that she does not wake up by what 15 and 25 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.159
 years different salons and everything small 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.720
 world there is extremely happy and so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 he was missing a prime person who 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.299
 was still a little crucial to help 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 my mother who she was basically this 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.110
 portage abroad and I love these 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.130
 families there because final all 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.450
 people get along well and I find that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 it 's good people's intelligence 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 who are like that who left desgagnÃ©s 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.650
 recomposed or out of respect for children 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.740
 each other out of respect for 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.890
 stories 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.659
 well we all decide to get together and 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.159
 celebrate all of this together because in the end 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.409
 ben christmas this is a story here 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.600
 so that was my christmas memory 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.369
 but you have to think about those who do not 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 always such a complicated family 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.939
 she who can welcome them at Christmas 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.399
 I think of the elderly 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.380
 especially so does like you 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.380
 support the association of little brothers
