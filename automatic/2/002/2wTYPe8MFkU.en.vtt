your<00:00:09.420> save<00:00:09.900> state<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:11.599> the<00:00:12.599> SNES<00:00:13.110> emulator<00:00:14.540> so

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
your save state on the SNES emulator so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.670 
your save state on the SNES emulator so
we<00:00:15.839> go<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> config<00:00:17.480> saves<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> way

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we go to config saves and all the way

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.679 
we go to config saves and all the way
down<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.689> rewind<00:00:22.519> so<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.240> space

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
down here rewind so I have it on space

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.920 
down here rewind so I have it on space
because<00:00:25.320> space<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> control<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.779> me

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
because space is not a control for me

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.620 
because space is not a control for me
it's<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> jump<00:00:29.250> or<00:00:29.400> anything<00:00:30.500> but<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.740> um

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's not the jump or anything but if um

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.080 
it's not the jump or anything but if um
say<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> number<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.730> 5

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
work so I don't really use the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.819 
work so I don't really use the
miscellaneous<00:01:26.850> options<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.290> um<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.420> do

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
miscellaneous options but um if you do

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.980 
miscellaneous options but um if you do
for<00:01:31.829> some<00:01:32.040> reason<00:01:32.570> then<00:01:33.570> I'd<00:01:34.079> recommend<00:01:34.579> um

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
for some reason then I'd recommend um

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.420 
for some reason then I'd recommend um
you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> number<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.220> want

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can have it as a number if you want

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can have it as a number if you want
but<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.329> easiest<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:41.930> put<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
