00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
II goo that we've got there that goes
back<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.040> hole<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.240> at<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> moment<00:02:00.719> all

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
back over the hole so at the moment all

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.130 
back over the hole so at the moment all
that<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> residual<00:02:02.189> cooking<00:02:02.610> juices

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
that is is the residual cooking juices

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
that is is the residual cooking juices
all<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.380> little<00:02:04.590> bits<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> protein<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
all the little bits of protein in the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.479 
all the little bits of protein in the
bottom<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> pan<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.570> tablespoon<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.799> flour

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
bottom of the pan a tablespoon of flour

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.469 
bottom of the pan a tablespoon of flour
and<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> add

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
and I'm going to add

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.850 
and I'm going to add
a<00:02:10.800> chicken<00:02:11.800> stock<00:02:12.450> add<00:02:13.450> as<00:02:13.690> much<00:02:13.900> as<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.379> do

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
a chicken stock add as much as you do

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.490 
a chicken stock add as much as you do
you<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.269> you're<00:02:16.269> going<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.510> add<00:02:16.659> alcohol<00:02:16.900> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you like you're going to add alcohol to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.300 
you like you're going to add alcohol to
this<00:02:17.739> like<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.610> example<00:02:18.670> red<00:02:19.239> or<00:02:19.360> white<00:02:19.540> wine

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
this like for example red or white wine

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.119 
this like for example red or white wine
my<00:02:21.310> advice<00:02:21.610> would<00:02:21.879> be<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.090> add<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:23.129> before

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
my advice would be to add that before

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.070 
my advice would be to add that before
you<00:02:24.280> add<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.610> stock<00:02:24.909> so<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.299> always<00:02:25.720> add<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you add the stock so I always add the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.619 
you add the stock so I always add the
alcohol<00:02:26.590> first<00:02:26.890> burn<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.730> alcohol<00:02:28.209> off<00:02:28.390> and

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
alcohol first burn the alcohol off and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.940 
alcohol first burn the alcohol off and
then<00:02:29.200> add<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.860> stock<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.319> happens<00:02:32.739> now

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
then add the stock so what happens now

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.530 
then add the stock so what happens now
is<00:02:32.980> we're<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.670> reduce<00:02:33.849> this<00:02:34.269> down

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
is we're just going to reduce this down

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.020 
is we're just going to reduce this down
to<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:35.319> nice<00:02:35.610> big<00:02:37.260> gravy<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.819> going<00:02:39.940> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
to a nice big gravy and this is going to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.479 
to a nice big gravy and this is going to
take<00:02:40.299> probably<00:02:41.110> about<00:02:41.590> two<00:02:41.950> or<00:02:41.980> three<00:02:42.099> minutes

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
take probably about two or three minutes

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.479 
take probably about two or three minutes
of<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.030> constant<00:02:43.599> stirring<00:02:44.160> before<00:02:45.160> we<00:02:45.280> have

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
of just constant stirring before we have

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.449 
of just constant stirring before we have
the<00:02:45.790> desired<00:02:46.209> consistency<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:48.220> right<00:02:48.310> now

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the desired consistency all right now

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.670
