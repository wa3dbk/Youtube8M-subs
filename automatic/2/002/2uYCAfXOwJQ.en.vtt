like to show you a few tips for working

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.379 
like to show you a few tips for working
with<00:00:06.990> your<00:00:07.170> large<00:00:07.350> format<00:00:07.799> cameras<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.490> usually

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
with your large format cameras I usually

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.940 
with your large format cameras I usually
show<00:00:09.570> these<00:00:09.780> tips<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.290> students<00:00:10.710> when<00:00:10.830> I'm

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
show these tips to my students when I'm

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.310 
show these tips to my students when I'm
teaching<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.059> them<00:00:12.240> myself<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
teaching and I use them myself so the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.419 
teaching and I use them myself so the
first<00:00:13.559> thing<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.980> show<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
first thing I'm going to show you is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.799 
first thing I'm going to show you is
what<00:00:14.639> I've<00:00:14.730> talked<00:00:14.940> about<00:00:15.059> before<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
what I've talked about before is the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.700 
what I've talked about before is the
near-far<00:00:16.320> focusing<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:18.900> tip<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.320> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
near-far focusing the first tip is is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.060 
near-far focusing the first tip is is
what<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> call<00:00:20.430> scale<00:00:20.789> focusing<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.769> very

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
what I call scale focusing and it's very

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.340 
what I call scale focusing and it's very
simple<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:24.390> wearing<00:00:24.750> glasses<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
simple to do me wearing glasses and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
simple to do me wearing glasses and
having<00:00:25.560> trifocals<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> lot<00:00:26.699> easier<00:00:27.029> for

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
having trifocals it's a lot easier for

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.109 
having trifocals it's a lot easier for
me<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> km<00:00:29.310> cameras<00:00:29.760> you've

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
me to do so on all the km cameras you've

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
me to do so on all the km cameras you've
got<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.630> focusing<00:00:31.109> scale<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.679> you'll

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
got a little focusing scale and you'll

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
got a little focusing scale and you'll
notice<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> 8<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.000> 10<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.300> particular

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
notice like on the 8 by 10 in particular

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.299 
notice like on the 8 by 10 in particular
there's<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.140> bar<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
there's a little bar here you get the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.490 
there's a little bar here you get the
focusing<00:00:35.760> knob<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.600> we're<00:00:36.690> gonna<00:00:36.780> unlock<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
focusing knob so we're gonna unlock this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.750 
focusing knob so we're gonna unlock this
so<00:00:38.250> right<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.790> let's<00:00:39.000> say<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.930> near<00:00:40.140> focus

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
so right here let's say the near focus

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.170 
so right here let's say the near focus
was<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.320> 17<00:00:43.320> millimeters<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:44.789> 17

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
was at 17 millimeters actually 17

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.479 
was at 17 millimeters actually 17
centimeters<00:00:45.719> its<00:00:45.840> end<00:00:46.020> centimeter<00:00:46.590> scale<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
centimeters its end centimeter scale so

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
centimeters its end centimeter scale so
let's<00:00:47.610> say<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> 17<00:00:48.329> centimeters<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.350> what

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
let's say was it 17 centimeters so what

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
let's say was it 17 centimeters so what
I<00:00:49.530> usually<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.980> write<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.730> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I usually do is write that down in a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.860 
I usually do is write that down in a
notebook<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.570> let's<00:00:52.350> say<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> far<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.870> 15

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
notebook and let's say the far was at 15

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.790 
notebook and let's say the far was at 15
centimeters<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.140> split<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
centimeters so what I do is I split the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
centimeters so what I do is I split the
difference<00:00:58.980> between<00:00:59.309> 15<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.120> 17<00:01:00.629> centimeters

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
difference between 15 and 17 centimeters

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
difference between 15 and 17 centimeters
what<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> would<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.550> set<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.000> at

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
what I would do is I would set this at

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.280 
what I would do is I would set this at
16<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:05.450> then<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.689> would<00:01:06.869> look<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
16 and then I would look through the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
16 and then I would look through the
ground<00:01:07.530> glass<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.220> stop<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> lens<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
ground glass and stop down the lens so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
ground glass and stop down the lens so
you<00:01:10.140> focus<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> near<00:01:11.250> look<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you focus on the near look at the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.969 
you focus on the near look at the
numbers<00:01:12.240> focus<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> far<00:01:13.439> look<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
numbers focus on the far look at the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
numbers focus on the far look at the
number<00:01:14.310> always<00:01:15.180> write<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.780> because

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
number always write them down because

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
number always write them down because
you're<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.290> forget<00:01:16.549> then<00:01:17.549> split<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you're going to forget then split the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.770 
you're going to forget then split the
difference<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:20.180> stop<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.600> lens

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
difference and then stop down your lens

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
difference and then stop down your lens
to<00:01:21.960> check<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> check<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:22.950> sure<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to check the check to make sure you have

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:36.480 
to check the check to make sure you have
depth<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.640> field

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.030 

you

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.710 

now<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.250> probably<00:01:44.490> wondering<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.570> my

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
now you're probably wondering what if my

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
now you're probably wondering what if my
camera<00:01:45.930> doesn't<00:01:46.260> have<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> focusing<00:01:47.010> scale

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
camera doesn't have a focusing scale

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.970 
camera doesn't have a focusing scale
very<00:01:48.120> simple<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.290> yourself<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.740> little

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
very simple just get yourself a little

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.470 
very simple just get yourself a little
ruler<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> cost<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.150> couple<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.420> bucks

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
ruler like this cost a couple of bucks

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.050 
ruler like this cost a couple of bucks
at<00:01:51.780> our<00:01:51.900> office<00:01:52.140> supply<00:01:52.410> store<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.100> once

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
at our office supply store and once

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.020 
at our office supply store and once
again<00:01:54.240> let's<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.320> focus<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.950> NIR<00:01:56.250> let's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
again let's say focus on the NIR let's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.460 
again let's say focus on the NIR let's
use<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> millimeter<00:01:57.690> scale<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:58.230> or<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
use the millimeter scale here or the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.680 
use the millimeter scale here or the
centimeter<00:01:58.860> scale<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> should<00:01:59.370> say<00:01:59.550> so<00:02:00.480> let's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
centimeter scale I should say so let's

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.530 
centimeter scale I should say so let's
say<00:02:00.840> we're<00:02:01.050> at<00:02:01.430> 13<00:02:02.430> centimeters<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> NIR

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
say we're at 13 centimeters for the NIR

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.670 
say we're at 13 centimeters for the NIR
and<00:02:04.940> with<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.090> rule<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.450> 14<00:02:06.840> centimeters<00:02:07.440> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and with this rule of 14 centimeters for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.820 
and with this rule of 14 centimeters for
the<00:02:07.740> Farr<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:10.200> we'll<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.500> split<00:02:10.710> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the Farr and then we'll just split the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.270 
the Farr and then we'll just split the
difference<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.280> focusing<00:02:11.820> at<00:02:11.970> 13<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.660> half

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
difference for focusing at 13 and a half

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.760 
difference for focusing at 13 and a half
so<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:15.240> know<00:02:15.360> also<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.960> can<00:02:16.110> find<00:02:16.320> solutions

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so you know also we can find solutions

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.500 
so you know also we can find solutions
to<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.130> problems<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.850> say<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.330> your

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to all the problems but as I say if your

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.910 
to all the problems but as I say if your
camera<00:02:18.720> doesn't<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.290> good<00:02:19.470> focusing

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
camera doesn't have a good focusing

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.650 
camera doesn't have a good focusing
scale<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.880> yourself<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.209> little<00:02:21.390> metal

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
scale just get yourself a little metal

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.570 
scale just get yourself a little metal
ruler<00:02:21.840> keep<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.560> vest<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.070> you're

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
ruler keep it in your vest and you're

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.240 
ruler keep it in your vest and you're
all<00:02:23.760> set<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.240> hope<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.230> helps<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.530> thanks<00:02:26.100> for

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
all set I hope that helps you thanks for

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.580 
all set I hope that helps you thanks for
