00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.159
 won 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.790
 5 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.740
 Hi. I 'm Daury. 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:30.760
 4 I had another turn in three years. 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:33.340
 Uh members and aggression against another and did not come for three years during which time 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.239
 So I guess I felt a lot of importance 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.649
 I tried to work hard hard this time special 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.550
 Yes 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:47.949
 Some time ago I had a little Sorworld. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:52.239
 I always stay together. I can not get along with the members. 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:56.979
 Doedeoraguyo a lot to get paid to fill the stage, so this activity is really 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:00.969
 It seems to be fun, and the members are also preparing with the poetry 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:04.809
 Because of the stereotypes team and 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.600
 Kenji poet who wrote and wrote in Gwanghwamun 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.600
 Together we now use it as a collaborative song. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.880
 In the meantime, if you shoe is funky to say the sms lost 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.420
 smp I did not say anything about this. 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.619
 This time I take a lot of strength and then I personally 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.850
 When Super Junior's saying a lot of songs that sound sound sound jet meat 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.259
 I'm giving it to you. 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:33.819
 I wonder if I could think of a Debran song now 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:37.539
 I cautiously expect if some movies will follow in images 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:42.520
 So I did this with a yes music video 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.869
 I think that's why I have tried so many different things. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.400
 I hope you like me. 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:52.120
 Girl groups are awesome. 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.320
 There is a very good thing, I ditch the same zest for the unusual 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.090
 And because there are so many girl groups, 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.960
 And I can not really joking example why I produced my yen per US again 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.080
 Are we going to have another little hard to know today who honestly Group transvestite 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.220
 So my hair came out again, and the pattern seems to be having fun 4 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.240
 I think it's because I recognize the difference. 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.800
 I'm wrong because I'm just two different chapters . 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.300
 It's not. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.950
 Just I think how it took 10 years to recognize this ppuninde others 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.340
 I see. 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.720
 My friend may be like that , or he can do that to me. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 One of the moments really likes it. It really gets better. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.080
 I 'm not looking at these guys, so I was not on this team. 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.880
 I thought you liked these guys. 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.880
 I do not think it should be a mouth amber anymore .
