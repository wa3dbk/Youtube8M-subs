compartment section up here you have
this<00:03:00.360> little<00:03:00.540> piece<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.320> acts<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.610> lock<00:03:02.910> to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
this little piece that acts as a lock to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.840 
this little piece that acts as a lock to
lock<00:03:03.870> him<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.770> there<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.640> is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
lock him in there because that is

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.540 
lock him in there because that is
basically<00:03:06.300> what<00:03:06.420> he<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.250> sitting<00:03:08.250> inside

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
basically what he is sitting inside

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.370 
basically what he is sitting inside
there<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:11.330> let's<00:03:12.330> get<00:03:12.570> him<00:03:12.750> down<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
there so let's get him down there and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.770 
there so let's get him down there and
this<00:03:13.470> kind<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.850> locks<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.450> keep<00:03:15.480> them

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
this kind of just it locks to keep them

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.720 
this kind of just it locks to keep them
in<00:03:15.900> place<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.260> he<00:03:16.320> doesn't<00:03:16.470> fall<00:03:16.680> out<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:17.130> then

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
in place so he doesn't fall out and then

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.770 
in place so he doesn't fall out and then
his<00:03:18.060> legs<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.780> down<00:03:19.740> here<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.610> front<00:03:20.820> so

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
his legs are down here in the front so

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.630
