 a bunch of but such cucumbers such 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 size 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.170
 we prepared with the calculation so that you 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.989
 oriented on the three-liter jar 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.430

 cucumbers we carefully translate complete 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 at the bottom of 3 liter jars we stack 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.390
 our greens dill dill horseradish leaves 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.820

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:07.189
 black currant leaf start 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 stack our cucumbers cucumbers jars 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.180
 now we make marinade for them not 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.049
 Marina in Minsk in ordinary water from 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.040
 borehole and tap cold raw 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.450
 what drinking water do you have on 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.610
 three-liter jar glass of salt if u 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.400
 Someone does not have a glass, then I will tell you that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.439
 these are two tablespoons full assembly 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.290
 rock salt 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.610
 I do this to dissolve well 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.610
 as first 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.229
 and pour the bath 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.320
 and now you just own well 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.030
 good drinking water is therefore straight with 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 crane dial 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:20.530
 and topping up the salt that remained in 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:20.530
