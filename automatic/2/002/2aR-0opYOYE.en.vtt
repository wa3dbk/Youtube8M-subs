00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
what I would like to do is would like to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
what I would like to do is would like to
always<00:00:48.210> try<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> move<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> his<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> a

always try to move to his back or to a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
always try to move to his back or to a
single<00:00:50.550> leg<00:00:50.699> but<00:00:51.449> sometimes<00:00:51.780> he<00:00:51.930> posts<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.559> me

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
single leg but sometimes he posts on me

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
single leg but sometimes he posts on me
first<00:00:52.949> let's<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.140> options

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
first let's kind of look at the options

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.090 
first let's kind of look at the options
here<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.550> would<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.790> in<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.420> scenario<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here I would like in this scenario to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.869 
here I would like in this scenario to
get<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> here<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.410> instead<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.219> stepping<00:01:02.610> his

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
get to here but instead of stepping his

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.900 
get to here but instead of stepping his
leg<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.680> sometimes<00:01:04.680> people<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.399> post<00:01:05.580> on

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
leg back sometimes people will post on

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.870 
leg back sometimes people will post on
my<00:01:06.090> head<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.840> square<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.800> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.789> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
my head to square up and this is the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.920 
my head to square up and this is the
dilemma<00:01:09.149> that<00:01:09.330> we're<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> dealing<00:01:09.750> with

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
dilemma that we're kind of dealing with

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
dilemma that we're kind of dealing with
today<00:01:10.289> will<00:01:10.649> demonstrate<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.160> once<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.399> we

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
today will demonstrate it once and we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.380 
today will demonstrate it once and we
explain<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.789> with<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> little<00:01:12.119> bit<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:12.420> detail

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.740 

so<00:01:19.789> basically<00:01:20.789> what<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> giving<00:01:21.330> us<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so basically what this is giving us is a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.320 
so basically what this is giving us is a
double<00:01:22.020> leg<00:01:22.170> takedown

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
double leg takedown

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.790 
double leg takedown
whenever<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> arm<00:01:24.690> drag<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.229> move<00:01:25.410> he

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
whenever I arm drag and move he

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.040 
whenever I arm drag and move he
automatically<00:01:26.520> frames<00:01:26.940> off<00:01:27.179> of<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.509> shoulder

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
automatically frames off of my shoulder

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.410 
automatically frames off of my shoulder
and<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.319> face<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.880> I've<00:01:29.970> got<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.330> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and my face so what I've got to do is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.139 
and my face so what I've got to do is
make<00:01:30.539> sure<00:01:30.599> my<00:01:30.869> foot<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.349> middle<00:01:31.679> I<00:01:32.149> pop

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
make sure my foot is in the middle I pop

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.859 
make sure my foot is in the middle I pop
this<00:01:33.270> elbow<00:01:33.569> up<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:36.000> keep<00:01:36.179> a<00:01:36.300> straight<00:01:36.630> line

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this elbow up and I keep a straight line

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.370 
this elbow up and I keep a straight line
with<00:01:37.080> my<00:01:37.229> hip<00:01:37.440> in<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.740> knee<00:01:37.880> my<00:01:38.880> shoulder<00:01:39.380> my

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
with my hip in my knee my shoulder my

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.900 
with my hip in my knee my shoulder my
hands<00:01:40.649> are<00:01:40.830> s<00:01:41.039> cupping<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.050> lift<00:01:43.050> turning

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.339 

the<00:01:50.910> important<00:01:51.450> detail<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
the important detail I think about this

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.529 
the important detail I think about this
move<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.800> timing<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.209> pop<00:01:54.330> that

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
move is the timing of when to pop that

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.699 
move is the timing of when to pop that
elbow<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:57.360> soon<00:01:57.599> as<00:01:57.660> his<00:01:57.899> elbow<00:01:58.380> gets

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
elbow it's now as soon as his elbow gets

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.699 
elbow it's now as soon as his elbow gets
connected<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.910> me<00:02:00.179> feeling<00:02:00.569> starts<00:02:01.410> pushing

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
connected to me feeling starts pushing

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.290 
connected to me feeling starts pushing
me<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.789> creates<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.209> little

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
me that creates that little

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.479 
me that creates that little
spring-loaded<00:02:03.750> part<00:02:04.319> too<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.130> pop<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.429> up

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
spring-loaded part too I could pop it up

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.229 
spring-loaded part too I could pop it up
and<00:02:05.610> make<00:02:05.700> something<00:02:06.030> happen<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:08.000> when<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> get

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and make something happen so when I get

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
and make something happen so when I get
to<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> feel<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.520> go

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to when I feel that I don't want to go

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
to when I feel that I don't want to go
yet<00:02:11.849> where's<00:02:12.180> my<00:02:12.330> foot<00:02:12.569> look<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:12.930> my<00:02:13.020> foot<00:02:13.290> I
