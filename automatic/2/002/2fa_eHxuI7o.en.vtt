to<00:00:40.489> face<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:41.090> cheetah<00:00:41.390> pattern<00:00:41.660> it's<00:00:42.470> a

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
to face the cheetah pattern it's a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.710 
to face the cheetah pattern it's a
35-foot<00:00:43.399> pattern<00:00:43.820> it's<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.300> shortest

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
35-foot pattern it's the shortest

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.049 
35-foot pattern it's the shortest
pattern<00:00:45.140> on<00:00:45.230> tour<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.800> it's<00:00:46.100> almost<00:00:46.489> also<00:00:46.909> the

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
pattern on tour and it's almost also the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.569 
pattern on tour and it's almost also the
highest<00:00:47.269> risk<00:00:47.870> reward<00:00:48.110> pattern<00:00:48.860> that's<00:00:49.370> right

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
highest risk reward pattern that's right

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.160 
highest risk reward pattern that's right
Chris<00:00:49.790> this<00:00:49.970> pattern<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.329> our<00:00:50.510> source<00:00:50.690> pattern

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
Chris this pattern is our source pattern

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.290 
Chris this pattern is our source pattern
the<00:00:51.379> scores<00:00:51.650> tend<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:51.949> be<00:00:52.040> a<00:00:52.070> lot<00:00:52.250> higher<00:00:52.489> but

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
the scores tend to be a lot higher but

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.549 
the scores tend to be a lot higher but
you<00:00:53.510> can<00:00:53.629> also<00:00:53.750> get<00:00:53.960> yourself<00:00:54.290> in<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.409> lot<00:00:54.440> of

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
you can also get yourself in a lot of

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.869 
you can also get yourself in a lot of
trouble<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.040> don't<00:00:55.220> use<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.489> right<00:00:55.670> ball

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879

we're going to help you with that here
today<00:00:58.579> typically<00:00:59.570> with<00:00:59.989> this<00:01:00.140> short<00:01:00.410> pattern

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
today typically with this short pattern

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.619 
today typically with this short pattern
you<00:01:01.250> have<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.730> play<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.059> your<00:01:02.210> break<00:01:02.390> point

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
you have to play with your break point

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.509 
you have to play with your break point
further<00:01:02.930> to<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.170> right<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:04.009> you're<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.460> to

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
further to the right and you're going to

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.609 
further to the right and you're going to
have<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.850> play<00:01:05.000> pretty<00:01:05.869> straight<00:01:06.259> if<00:01:06.440> you're<00:01:06.470> a

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
have to play pretty straight if you're a

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.260 
have to play pretty straight if you're a
low<00:01:06.800> red<00:01:07.039> player<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.580> for<00:01:07.820> someone<00:01:08.000> like<00:01:08.149> you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
low red player and for someone like you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.609 
low red player and for someone like you
you<00:01:08.570> might<00:01:08.690> have<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:08.990> hook<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.289> lot<00:01:09.440> more

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
you might have to hook it a lot more

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.040 
you might have to hook it a lot more
yeah<00:01:10.100> I<00:01:10.130> tend<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.520> use<00:01:10.610> weaker<00:01:11.420> weaker<00:01:11.690> balls

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
yeah I tend to use weaker weaker balls

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.270 
yeah I tend to use weaker weaker balls
with<00:01:12.229> strong<00:01:12.470> drills<00:01:12.740> try<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:12.950> get<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.160> ball

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
with strong drills try to get the ball

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.469 
with strong drills try to get the ball
through<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.580> front<00:01:13.729> part<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.060> lane<00:01:14.240> get

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
through the front part of the lane get

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.820 
through the front part of the lane get
that<00:01:14.630> ball<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.990> spot<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.259> I<00:01:15.440> want<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:15.710> get

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
that ball to the spot that I want to get

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.650 
that ball to the spot that I want to get
to<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.190> way<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.759> drill<00:01:17.030> kind<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.420> help<00:01:17.539> it

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
to that way the drill kind of help it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.870 
to that way the drill kind of help it
roll<00:01:18.229> off<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.649> it<00:01:18.770> opposed<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.100> jerk<00:01:19.340> off<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.700> but

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
roll off of it opposed a jerk off of but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.300 
roll off of it opposed a jerk off of but
the<00:01:19.970> week<00:01:20.420> ball<00:01:20.630> get<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.080> spot<00:01:21.440> so<00:01:22.220> if

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
the week ball get it to that spot so if

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.340 
the week ball get it to that spot so if
you<00:01:22.429> have<00:01:22.580> high<00:01:22.759> tilt<00:01:23.119> or<00:01:23.330> high<00:01:23.690> revs<00:01:24.020> you're

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
you have high tilt or high revs you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.870 
you have high tilt or high revs you're
going<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.530> want<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.710> play<00:01:24.860> left<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.580> you're

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
going to want to play left and you're

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.399 
going to want to play left and you're
going<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.090> use<00:01:26.210> stronger<00:01:26.479> balls<00:01:26.810> they're

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
going to use stronger balls they're

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.529 
going to use stronger balls they're
stronger<00:01:27.800> drills<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.369> weaker<00:01:28.700> weaker<00:01:29.149> balls

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
stronger drills with weaker weaker balls

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.210 
stronger drills with weaker weaker balls
for<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.289> most<00:01:30.470> part<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.830> common<00:01:31.100> denominator

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
for the most part the common denominator

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.040 
for the most part the common denominator
here<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.910> getting<00:01:32.209> your<00:01:32.390> ball<00:01:32.539> right<00:01:32.750> off<00:01:32.780> I

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
don't really care how you do it we just

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.370 
don't really care how you do it we just

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
or not you want to do it from the left

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.100 
or not you want to do it from the left
of<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.729> one<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.209> I<00:01:38.390> do<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.690> or<00:01:38.810> if<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:38.959> want

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110

of the one like I do it or if you want
to<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.349> over<00:01:39.440> it's<00:01:39.649> closer<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.220> right

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
to do it over it's closer to the right

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.219 
to do it over it's closer to the right
like<00:01:40.580> Chris<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:41.030> Walter<00:01:41.239> right<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.630> all

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
like Chris and Walter right to it all

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.839 
like Chris and Walter right to it all
we've<00:01:42.410> seen<00:01:42.560> just<00:01:42.770> about<00:01:42.830> everything<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.550> do

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
we've seen just about everything you do

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.160 
we've seen just about everything you do
seems<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.209> be<00:01:44.300> comfortable<00:01:44.660> for<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:44.989> on<00:01:45.050> this

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
seems to be comfortable for you on this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.589

board<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.440> think<00:02:19.370> we're<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.730> show<00:02:19.970> you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
board I think we're going to go show you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.839 
board I think we're going to go show you
some<00:02:20.239> videos<00:02:20.569> here<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.489> tapes<00:02:22.670> we

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
some videos here of some of the tapes we

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.400 
some videos here of some of the tapes we
have<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.270> motel<00:02:23.569> six<00:02:23.840> term<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.080> couple

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
have from the motel six term a couple

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.350 
have from the motel six term a couple
years<00:02:24.500> ago<00:02:24.620> which<00:02:24.920> by<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.370> way<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.790> did<00:02:26.150> win

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
years ago which by the way you did win

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.030 
years ago which by the way you did win
so<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:26.989> don't<00:02:27.110> really<00:02:27.260> know<00:02:27.440> why<00:02:27.709> you're<00:02:27.890> asking

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
so I don't really know why you're asking

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.979 
so I don't really know why you're asking
me<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.550> tell<00:02:28.760> me<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:29.930> me

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
me and tell me that you know it's me

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.270 
me and tell me that you know it's me
because<00:02:30.379> you've<00:02:30.530> won<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.800> tournament<00:02:30.950> twice

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
on this pattern so but we'll watch the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.229 
on this pattern so but we'll watch the
video<00:02:33.110> it's<00:02:33.830> nice<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.310> share<00:02:34.550> once<00:02:35.060> in

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
a while one of the first sex you'll see

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.800 
a while one of the first sex you'll see
here<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.490> Tommy<00:02:37.760> doing<00:02:38.060> what<00:02:38.180> he<00:02:38.300> always<00:02:38.330> does

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
and that's running him over got that one

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.589

a<00:02:42.489> little<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.849> know<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.270> see<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.510> one

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
a little you know you can see that one

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.270 
a little you know you can see that one
got<00:02:43.750> too<00:02:44.290> far<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> right<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.830> didn't<00:02:45.130> really

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
got too far the right I didn't really

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.680 
got too far the right I didn't really
like<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.640> whole<00:02:45.760> lot<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.120> tried<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.330> go<00:02:46.510> high

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
like it a whole lot it tried to go high

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.210 
like it a whole lot it tried to go high
but<00:02:46.989> fortunately<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.860> right<00:02:47.980> ball<00:02:48.160> in

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
but fortunately have the right ball in

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.410 
but fortunately have the right ball in
my<00:02:48.280> hand<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.489> get<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.730> slow<00:02:48.880> down<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.090> little<00:02:49.239> bit

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
my hand to get to slow down a little bit

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.720 
my hand to get to slow down a little bit
what<00:02:49.930> made<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:50.500> ball<00:02:50.730> well

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
what made that the right ball well

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.460 
what made that the right ball well
because<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.090> didn't<00:02:52.270> overreact<00:02:52.569> when<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.230> got

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
because it didn't overreact when I got

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.589 
because it didn't overreact when I got
to<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:54.069> know<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.940> use<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> different<00:02:55.480> ball

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
to go you know if I use a different ball

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.150 
to go you know if I use a different ball
there<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.959> get<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.170> all<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.920> way<00:02:57.010> out<00:02:57.040> there

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
there and get it all the way out there

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.470 
there and get it all the way out there
the<00:02:57.430> gutter<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.700> going<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.940> overreact<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the gutter it's going to overreact and

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.610 
the gutter it's going to overreact and
go<00:02:58.599> high<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.780> then<00:02:59.019> when<00:02:59.110> i<00:02:59.170> get<00:02:59.319> one<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.590> a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
go high and then when i get one in a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.780 
go high and then when i get one in a
little<00:02:59.860> bit<00:02:59.980> it's<00:03:00.069> not<00:03:00.190> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.400> pick<00:03:00.519> up<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
little bit it's not going to pick up and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.949 
little bit it's not going to pick up and
roll<00:03:00.910> enough<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.360> then<00:03:01.450> i'm<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> now<00:03:01.930> i

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
roll enough and then i'm going to now i

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.410
