00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 hey people here and today in the video 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 goes to the call of duty advance wolfer and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 From now on, I'll believe it all 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.590
 I do not abbreviate with crafting dab 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 always advanced election meeting but year 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.550
 we'll see, of course it works 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 in the video not just this one 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 screenshot or the one photo but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.500
 I want the whole topic with the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.699
 I will introduce you now 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 Immediately show 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 this is a picture of the leaderboard of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.180
 the scoreboard of a call of duty 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.340
 advanced uav game and you see im 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.160
 lower team 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.570
 bp stands for big timer I guess 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 optik big timer was namely apparent 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 at the sledgehammer games studios and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
 has tested the whole game 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.610
 I think that's cool 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.730
 more comparative player either invite 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 I know fictitious but not play anymore 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 He was invited anyway and many 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 other competent players also you have to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.239
 but say that because collectively the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.250
 Ghosts has been the whole thing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.180
 and that's very important 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.399
 I want a little over now 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.539
 comparative gaming talk very briefly and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 then we come back to the whole 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 capture the flag team back so you 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.380
 definitely have to say the project 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 Actually, the company was always on 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.960
 everyone was studio that competitively so i 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 sports has been very supportive and infinity 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 was was that the whole under the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.810
 turned table and not at all 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 immediately I did believe in mw3 that was there 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 I'm even pretty sure that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
 can pelé saw there was that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.759
 do not even put in any patch 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.619
 can make 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.600
 for the people who wanted to play alone 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.250
 and you just could not do any lan partys 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.869
 So these are these events where you where you 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.369
 So in real terms, that's not about that 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 internet plays but over a lan 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 connection with with cables 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.869
 put together and then tournaments 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
 you could not even do that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.909
 because there was no support where there was 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.530
 no kind of spectator mode it is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.270
 the frieze there were very many 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 problems and they just wanted that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.380
 not patch at black ops 2 was that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.270
 whole then different and there has a call of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.960
 Duty spots also really started too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.030
 to grow 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.829
 and now in ghost that's all 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.439
 went on and that makes me very happy 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.780
 that infinity was there this step 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.180
 has made and it offered so supported has 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.600
 and at the last event at mlg 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.340
 Anaheim that was by the way 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.310
 Yesterday on sunday in any case that 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.190
 I looked at the final one until not 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.130
 On sunday, what am I talking about on sunday 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 So on the night from sunday to monday 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 until 5 o'clock in the early that took that 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.160
 I once looked at it unfortunately 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.080
 Titan lost and I wanted to go 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.430
 I would like to say a faire 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
 then introduce you once a week 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 i would call it a bot report 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.550
 or something knows name suggestions 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.170
 Of course, write in the comments 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.330
 and I would just like you one 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.920
 Sometimes the teams sometimes 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 sometimes something to the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.460
 next or to the current events 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.860
 just say something and just like that 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.350
 what to teach about call of duty spots 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.480
 I think that's just the way it is 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.520
 that it grows and is so important 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.500
 and I personally am super fun 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.120
 I look at all this and I am 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770
 a big fan i used to own myself 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.620
 but then I have to Michael 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.700
 Left decide youtube or esports 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.160
 if I'm really successful there 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
 then wants in competitive gaming and then 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.280
 I chose youtube 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.230
 because I have to go to school too 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.640
 still a few days to make synonymous 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.290
 I like to play basketball and so on 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.690
 I just do not have the time for that 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 that had but in any case I would 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.770
 like to make his spots report once 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.240
 in the week and I think that will be all 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.070
 many of you are interested too 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.590
 Just tell me that in the bottom 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.360
 comments in any case, golf is the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.100
 The esports with ghost now again around 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.960
 grown another piece and it is 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.240
 just madness like that in the height 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.780
 shoot the audience numbers and I have 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.550
 belongs 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.100
 I can take the article under 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.570
 link the call of duty go so that 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.330
 last event what I'm talking about right now 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.190
 device has anaheim of mlg mean that the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.360
 Most people watch at one 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.580
 major event had 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.260
 and that's all about league of legends 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.670
 ran and thought earlier call of duty 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.880
 will arrive then but somehow 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.140
 is that so fast and and so on 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.340
 there are more and more teams and the 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.110
 getting better as it is easy 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.520
 madness what is happening right now and 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.230
 That's why you'll be so happy 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.670
 to bring weekly series 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.220
 but now we come back to 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.930
 I do all this capture the flag 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.640
 must say that I love this 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.860
 mode i love capture the flag and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.550
 thus it is confirmed that he again 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.410
 returns 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.239
 the thing is in cologne fdi the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.859
 Maybe Sketche did not give big 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.440
 definitely not in the area of competence 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.750
 and that annoyed me at first because 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.980
 which have replaced with lightning but one 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.870
 have to say 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.970
 the flash just a great game mode 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.500
 it even for the audience at one 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.510
 watching lightning games that's easy 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.550
 too intense that's so much fun though 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.770
 capture the flag was of course great too 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.620
 I'm curious about lightning in call of duty 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.170
 advanced warfighter kfw again 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.640
 come back or not but I'm up 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.440
 every case very glad that capture the 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.720
 Flag comes back you can not now 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.180
 read something special from 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.830
 this from this photo except that big 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.460
 who was there and sometimes the whole thing 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.500
 could play 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.030
 In any case I think super and me 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.550

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.020
 weeks to get information both in the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060
 multiplayer area singleplayer as 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.590
 also in the area of ​​competence I believe there 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.690

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.550
