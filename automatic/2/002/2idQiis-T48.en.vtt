probably gonna be done now that I'm

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
probably gonna be done now that I'm
thinking<00:01:03.179> about<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.839> that<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.769> how

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
thinking about it now that I see how

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010 
thinking about it now that I see how
great<00:01:05.250> destiny<00:01:05.760> looks<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.930> thing

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
great destiny looks so the first thing

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.400 
great destiny looks so the first thing
for<00:01:07.260> me<00:01:07.410> is<00:01:07.560> maps<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.820> has<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.630> good<00:01:10.020> maps

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
for me is maps it has to have good maps

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.160 
for me is maps it has to have good maps
I<00:01:10.680> honestly<00:01:11.160> can't<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.510> ghost<00:01:12.900> map

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I honestly can't think of one ghost map

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.789 
I honestly can't think of one ghost map
that<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.620> actually<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.409> okay<00:01:16.409> look<00:01:16.619> for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that I actually like or okay look for

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
that I actually like or okay look for
example<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> black<00:01:17.640> ops<00:01:17.820> 2<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.090> love<00:01:18.659> raid<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
example in black ops 2 I love raid I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.010 
example in black ops 2 I love raid I
could<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.680> play<00:01:20.400> raid<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:21.119> day<00:01:21.600> every

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
could probably play raid all day every

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.569 
could probably play raid all day every
day<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.680> guess<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> people's

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
day it's like I guess a lot of people's

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.520 
day it's like I guess a lot of people's
nuketown<00:01:24.060> which<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.750> absolutely<00:01:24.869> cannot<00:01:25.470> stand

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
nuketown which I absolutely cannot stand

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.889 
nuketown which I absolutely cannot stand
that<00:01:25.890> map<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.880> goes<00:01:27.090> there's<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.840> one

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
that map but it goes there's not one

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.510 
that map but it goes there's not one
math<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.590> oh<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> play<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
math I'm like oh I want to play that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
math I'm like oh I want to play that
like<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.180> strike<00:01:30.750> zone<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
like not even strike zone because the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
like not even strike zone because the
spawns<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:32.670> wack<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
spawns are so wack in that map is just

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440 
spawns are so wack in that map is just
not<00:01:34.320> even<00:01:34.560> worth<00:01:34.740> playing<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.180> kit

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
not even worth playing and a lot of kit

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.859 
not even worth playing and a lot of kit
kids<00:01:36.750> camp<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> map<00:01:37.409> anyway<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.869> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
kids camp in that map anyway but the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
kids camp in that map anyway but the
maps<00:01:40.079> need<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.619> good<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.159> advanced

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

really gets me and ghosts is the fact
that<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.390> maps<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.200> huge<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.000> boring

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that the maps are so huge and so boring

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.630 
that the maps are so huge and so boring
and<00:01:57.149> there's<00:01:57.750> zero<00:01:58.320> flow<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:59.009> only<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.430> all

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and there's zero flow not only are all

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
and there's zero flow not only are all
like<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.539> only<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> maps<00:02:01.530> terrible

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
like not only are all the maps terrible

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.880 
like not only are all the maps terrible
in<00:02:02.549> goes<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> fact<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> spawns<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.200> bad

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
in goes the fact that the spawns are bad

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.440 
in goes the fact that the spawns are bad
as<00:02:05.369> well<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.299> how<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.560> ginormous

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
as well like how do you have ginormous

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.410 
as well like how do you have ginormous
size<00:02:09.450> maps<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:10.530> terrible<00:02:11.130> spawns<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
size maps with terrible spawns that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.820 
size maps with terrible spawns that
makes<00:02:12.900> zero<00:02:13.140> sense<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:14.250> me<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.680> makes<00:02:16.680> no<00:02:16.740> sense

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
makes zero sense to me it makes no sense

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740 
makes zero sense to me it makes no sense
and<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.430> drives<00:02:17.610> me<00:02:17.820> nuts<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.180> cannot<00:02:18.510> stand

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and it drives me nuts I cannot stand

being spawned next to an enemy how does
that<00:02:21.180> even<00:02:21.239> make<00:02:21.450> sense<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:22.500> fact<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.800> new

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
overpowered or maybe put in something

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.910 
overpowered or maybe put in something
like<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.750> advanced<00:03:46.049> UAV<00:03:46.260> where<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.799> could

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
like the advanced UAV where you could

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.860 
like the advanced UAV where you could
still<00:03:47.159> see<00:03:47.430> where<00:03:47.700> people<00:03:47.879> are<00:03:48.120> looking<00:03:48.569> but

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
still see where people are looking but

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.020 
still see where people are looking but
if<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.860> ghost<00:03:50.040> /<00:03:50.370> con<00:03:50.580> then<00:03:50.909> you're

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
if you have the ghost / con then you're

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.729 
if you have the ghost / con then you're
immune<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.659> but<00:03:51.689> you<00:03:52.080> still<00:03:52.319> have<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> move

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
immune to it but you still have to move

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.289 
immune to it but you still have to move
I<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.310> kind<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.640> evens<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.180> out<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
I think that kind of evens it out a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.820 
I think that kind of evens it out a
little<00:03:54.540> bit<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.930> speaking<00:03:55.379> of<00:03:55.500> streaks

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
little bit and speaking of streaks

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.399 
little bit and speaking of streaks
districts<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:56.970> fun<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.080> streets<00:03:58.319> and

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
districts have to be fun the streets and

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.000 
districts have to be fun the streets and
ghosts<00:03:58.680> are<00:03:58.769> boring<00:03:59.189> and<00:03:59.430> also<00:04:00.239> support<00:04:00.750> is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
ghosts are boring and also support is

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.350 
ghosts are boring and also support is
garbage<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.489> fact<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.790> there<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.030> lethal

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
garbage the fact that there are lethal

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.020 
garbage the fact that there are lethal
streaks<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.049> support<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.920> stupid<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:05.970> my

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
streaks and support is stupid in my

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.140 
streaks and support is stupid in my
opinion<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.500> squad<00:04:08.189> member<00:04:08.610> or

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
opinion like the squad member or

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.610 
opinion like the squad member or
squadmate<00:04:09.599> whatever<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.140> called<00:04:10.260> should

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
squadmate whatever it's called should

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.100 
squadmate whatever it's called should
not<00:04:10.769> be<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.189> support<00:04:11.790> street<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:12.329> that

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
not be a support street that's that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.390 
not be a support street that's that
kills<00:04:13.349> a<00:04:13.409> game<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.010> cell<00:04:14.189> phone

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
kills a game just like the cell phone

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400 
kills a game just like the cell phone

about<00:04:18.750> like<00:04:19.019> having<00:04:19.170> different<00:04:19.650> tiers<00:04:19.920> of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
about like having different tiers of

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.640 
about like having different tiers of
shrieks<00:04:20.400> that's<00:04:20.549> fine<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.870> have<00:04:22.470> to

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
shrieks that's fine but you have to

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.960 
shrieks that's fine but you have to
balance<00:04:22.890> that<00:04:23.220> out<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.400> little<00:04:23.610> bit<00:04:23.790> more

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
balance that out a little bit more

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.750 
balance that out a little bit more
because<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.630> never<00:04:25.080> ran<00:04:25.560> assault<00:04:26.070> streaks<00:04:26.610> and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
because I never ran assault streaks and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.640 
because I never ran assault streaks and
ghosts<00:04:26.970> because<00:04:27.150> they<00:04:27.390> were<00:04:27.450> terrible<00:04:28.080> it

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
ghosts because they were terrible it

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.860 
ghosts because they were terrible it
wasn't<00:04:29.280> anything<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.850> swarm<00:04:30.240> or<00:04:30.540> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
wasn't anything like the swarm or the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.420 
wasn't anything like the swarm or the
VTOL<00:04:31.260> or<00:04:31.790> anything<00:04:32.790> like<00:04:32.820> that

VTOL or anything like that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.860 
VTOL or anything like that
they're<00:04:33.760> just<00:04:33.970> they<00:04:34.120> were<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.330> plain<00:04:34.600> boring

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
they're just they were just plain boring

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.360 
they're just they were just plain boring
and<00:04:35.140> all<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.470> assault<00:04:35.770> streets<00:04:36.010> were<00:04:36.160> just

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
and all the assault streets were just

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.520 
and all the assault streets were just
obnoxiously<00:04:37.030> loud<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.780> we<00:04:37.930> all<00:04:38.050> know<00:04:38.080> ghost

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
obnoxiously loud and we all know ghost

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.380 
obnoxiously loud and we all know ghost
is<00:04:38.680> all<00:04:38.830> about<00:04:39.040> sound<00:04:39.310> whoring<00:04:39.610> which<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.030> hope

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
is all about sound whoring which I hope

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.360 
is all about sound whoring which I hope
that<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.900> not<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.290> case<00:04:41.500> with<00:04:41.890> advanced

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
that is not the case with advanced

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.010 
that is not the case with advanced
warfare<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.000> last<00:04:43.240> but<00:04:43.330> not<00:04:43.480> least<00:04:43.540> since<00:04:43.930> I

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
warfare and last but not least since I

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.140
