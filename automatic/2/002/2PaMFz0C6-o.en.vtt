00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that it's just hugely frustrating when I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.100

hits<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:22.650> makes<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.280> much

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
hits that which makes it just so much

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.880 
hits that which makes it just so much
worse<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.880> left<00:01:24.060> back<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> his<00:01:24.509> weak<00:01:24.659> foot

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
game at this point I was thinking and

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.050 
game at this point I was thinking and
that<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.410> when<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:12.100> substitute<00:04:12.549> started<00:04:12.940> to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
that is when the substitute started to

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.000 
that is when the substitute started to
happen<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:14.350> was<00:04:14.410> on<00:04:14.530> press<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.769> was<00:04:14.920> at

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
happen and I was on press I was at

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.800 
happen and I was on press I was at
constant<00:04:15.610> pressure<00:04:15.700> from<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.239> point<00:04:16.479> on<00:04:16.630> to

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
constant pressure from that point on to

it's not picked randomly but as you can
see<00:06:32.560> the<00:06:32.710> team<00:06:32.860> they're<00:06:33.039> absolute

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
see the team they're absolute

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.180 
see the team they're absolute
spectacular<00:06:34.029> team<00:06:34.240> really<00:06:34.539> it<00:06:35.409> was<00:06:35.589> it<00:06:36.070> was

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
spectacular team really it was it was

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.529

more<00:06:36.339> rewarding<00:06:36.789> to<00:06:36.849> score<00:06:37.180> this<00:06:37.360> team

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
more rewarding to score this team

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.399 
more rewarding to score this team
because<00:06:37.779> obviously<00:06:37.899> there<00:06:38.139> wasn't<00:06:38.259> an

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
because obviously there wasn't an

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.230 
because obviously there wasn't an
abundance<00:06:38.889> of<00:06:39.009> pace<00:06:39.250> up<00:06:39.460> front<00:06:39.669> so
