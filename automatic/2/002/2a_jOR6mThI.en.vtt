00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a difference so when we get to the part

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.600 
a difference so when we get to the part
where<00:01:08.729> work<00:01:09.000> we've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.110> shaped<00:01:10.610> we're

going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.570> sharpening<00:01:13.409> part<00:01:13.770> which

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
going to go to the sharpening part which

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.690

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
is called honing and if the knifes

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.380 
is called honing and if the knifes
ground<00:01:18.119> properly<00:01:18.830> then<00:01:19.830> honing<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:21.119> easy

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
ground properly then honing is very easy

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
if it's not ground properly it's quite

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.740 
if it's not ground properly it's quite
difficult<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.220> bokor<00:01:26.580> knife<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.509> is

quickly then you're making the edge
slick<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.610> wouldn't<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.570> good<00:02:03.840> or

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

it's<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.530> point<00:02:10.800> sharp

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
it's not going to get the point sharp

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
when you wonderful

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.080 
when you wonderful
it's<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.560> don't<00:02:13.709> maintain<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.519> 15

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it's because you don't maintain that 15

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.199 
it's because you don't maintain that 15
degrees<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.280> all<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.489> way<00:02:17.610> across<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
degrees or so all the way across the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.259 
degrees or so all the way across the
stone<00:02:18.480> when<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.379> do<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.769> dance

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
stone when I do it I do a little dance

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.729 
stone when I do it I do a little dance
so<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.299> when<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.379> side<00:02:22.680> I

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
so that when I get to the other side I

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.860 
so that when I get to the other side I
kind<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.159> get<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.700> left<00:02:24.030> toe<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.629> can

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
kind of get up on my left toe so I can

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.399 
kind of get up on my left toe so I can
keep<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.860> stroke<00:02:26.340> proper<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.870> if<00:02:28.260> you're

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
keep that stroke proper and if you're

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.660 
keep that stroke proper and if you're
doing<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.829> longer<00:02:29.040> knife<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.099> same<00:02:32.370> thing

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
doing a longer knife then the same thing

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.899 
doing a longer knife then the same thing
happens<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:34.069> start<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> heel<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.879> the

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
happens you start on the heel of the

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.550 
happens you start on the heel of the
knife<00:02:36.209> blade<00:02:36.739> about<00:02:37.739> 15<00:02:38.400> degree<00:02:38.760> angle<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
knife blade about 15 degree angle I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.170 
knife blade about 15 degree angle I
usually<00:02:40.560> put<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:40.769> hand<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.579> point<00:02:41.879> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
usually put my hand up on the point you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.089 
usually put my hand up on the point you
have<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:42.989> careful<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.860> let<00:02:44.010> your

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
have to be careful not to let your

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.699 
have to be careful not to let your
fingers<00:02:44.609> slip<00:02:44.940> off<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.390> front<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:46.500> your

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
fingers slip off the front because your

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.289 
fingers slip off the front because your
right<00:02:46.920> hand<00:02:47.220> will<00:02:47.400> keep<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.180> that's

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
right hand will keep going and that's

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.110 
right hand will keep going and that's
when<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:48.870> cut<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.670> get<00:02:50.790> into

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
when you get cut so you want to get into

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.140 
when you get cut so you want to get into
your<00:02:51.540> fingers<00:02:51.930> over<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.379> top<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.859> blade

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
your fingers over the top of the blade

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.940 
your fingers over the top of the blade
far<00:02:54.150> enough<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:55.500> not<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.829> to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
far enough so that you're not going to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.890 
far enough so that you're not going to
slip<00:02:56.190> off<00:02:58.400> down<00:02:59.400> by<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> heel<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.239> knife<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
slip off down by the heel of the knife a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.839 
slip off down by the heel of the knife a
lot<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.200> people<00:03:01.500> when<00:03:02.190> they<00:03:02.340> start<00:03:02.400> their

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
lot of people when they start their

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.759 
lot of people when they start their
stroke<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.450> come<00:03:03.659> off<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.109> stone

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
stroke that come off the stone

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.670 
stroke that come off the stone
immediately<00:03:05.549> you<00:03:06.359> want<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.720> make<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> long

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
immediately you want to make a long

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.339 
immediately you want to make a long
stroke<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.849> maybe<00:03:09.180> only<00:03:09.420> hone<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> couple

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
stroke and maybe only hone a couple

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.099 
stroke and maybe only hone a couple
inches<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> blade<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.239> first<00:03:12.810> few

inches of the blade on your first few
strokes<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.909> move<00:03:15.209> down<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.810> blade<00:03:16.760> as

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
strokes and then move down the blade as

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.659 
strokes and then move down the blade as
you<00:03:18.120> go<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:19.889> want<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.280> hard<00:03:20.519> enough
