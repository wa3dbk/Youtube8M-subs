00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.849
 hello my name is christophe la 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.200
 music is my passion forever 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.150
 and I want to share with you 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.329
 this passion through a few 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.650
 rather simple guitar tutorials we're going 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.270
 start besides for the pieces 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.660
 extremely basic that I like a lot 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.340
 in watchtower watch bobyl dylan good 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.720
 he's playing me him in C sharp minor 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.430
 other artists like jimi hendrix 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.380
 quillan picked up a lot more electrify 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.380
 to play it rather offensive it gave that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.110
 we're not going to do that because it's 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.800
 all in bar and it's a little painful to the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 dry guitar there is version 2d 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.610
 matthews which is not bad also in the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.770
 minor still very much commits you 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.230
 to listen to this version it's really 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.520
 super name is going to do it in G minor and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.350
 we will do it in G minor do not have 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.960
 still started but putting the hood 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.690
 three which is not uninteresting because 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 that suddenly the base is going to be an agreement 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.540
 from mid minor 43 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.130
 on minor and that will decline as 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.130
 that's a minor 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.330
 D major above 4 so it's not true 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.570
 complete major 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.650
 do we remove the middle finger on the sonnets 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:31.370
 mine soon 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:34.920
 these followed by the back we can 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.210
 possibly embellished like this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.240
 with a full of 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.909
 and again with or then succeeded towards 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.600
 the traffic is in open ropes that rings 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.840
 not bad too 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.940
 so i'm showing you chained ah 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.100
 yes small precision the first agreement 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.490
 the minor will be able from time to time 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.210
 to make a little monotony add 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.360
 get sharp here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.360
 Yes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.439
 the one like a corset for the little 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.360
 history this is the first agreement of 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.970
 Brice in dark side of the moon of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.550
 pink floyd 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.880
 very nice what we will do it sooner 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.880
 like that 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.490
 the chain at the level of arrhythmia arm 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.680
 everyone can feel it a bit like 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.680
 he wants we'll start earlier like this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 what's good about this piece is 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.950
 that the chords are extremely simple 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.660
 so everyone can play it in his sauce 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.880
 everyone can play it a little bit when 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.200
 we feel it's a piece that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 really leaves the door open to 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.570
 all the interpretations that's what 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.460
 is nice 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.470
 so that's for basic agreements 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.470
 now place to music 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.459
 it is especially 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.030
 works of art 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.360
 no idea 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.580
 the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.030
 in what state 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.479
 a few months ago 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 salary 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.790
 I 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.790
 m 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.949
 you 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.590
 Yes
