 varani talked about the values ​​of expectations, the fears of delights 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.140
 Milanese teenagers asked them a few questions

 professor de lillo what are the needs of adolescents today 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.239
 and are immediate needs to the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.409
 the art desire to feel taken into account by adults and adults 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.310
 so we can always think of some questions 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.790
 tv tonight on tv 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.090
 there are those who are willing to listen to me without prejudice 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.940
 without hesitation without judging myself 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.710
 but how another one also connects which is the question who loves me big needs 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.300
 need affection 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.320
 which is not just the need for affection 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.840
 we say the love of the month on the belonged to the affection of the parents, 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.410
 affection from others 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.530
 this also because 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 nothing else is often experienced as a threat 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.160
 and then you 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.750
 lube I want affection from the other 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 come on this is the other great need that today's kids have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 herm me the network of relationships 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.610
 if relationships are important they are the thing that matters most 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280
 more 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 then the family to the friends the boy of the boy eh just the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.840
 invitations to parties 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.720
 all this, however, has a negative side, it is so called 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.309
 look like a beautiful thing 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.489
 ebay is indeed a positive aspect 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.699
 but as a counterpart 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.439
 film what I said before the fear of the other ie 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.649
 closing oneself up in one's own narrow circle 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.279
 3 when you are among other cysts alone 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:34.339
 sogis artificially insulate us in the sense that we wear headphones we hear the 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:35.680
 music or 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.729
 we call from friends we need this contact 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.179
 continuous 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.859
 to overcome 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.829
 I don't want to use big words but we also say the anguish of being in 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.509
 among others because I do not know how the world is 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.729
 in the world of the other world of the I am a little threatening 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.779
 this also because the certainties that auctions were once in 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.339
 previous generations had 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.659
 certainty of being able to build one's future to be able to 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.430
 have a job getting married between buildings to plan their lives 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.219
 I'm very much away 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.589
 if not dropped but very very labile 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.539
 and then this involves then 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.579
 it is that one lives in the present 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.529
 villa 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.529
 absolutely in everyday life 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:37.729
 but little is planned and one lives with what he offers me today 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.469
 you said that in society and gender discrimination still exists 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.609
 but also said that among adolescents 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.909
 there are few gender differences what has ended a love exist 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:55.229
 gender discrimination because the company is still linked today 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:01.189
 adelchi spotto ip for which on the job for example the woman is evaluated - 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.469
 I expect a man because then there is motherhood because then you know how to dove 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.829
 what is is to blame you naturally see that 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.540
 meets graduates and for example for equal work 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.519
 women blackboard no 150 200 euros less per month than quarters 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.100
 gender differences disappear because among adolescents because I 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.590
 I believe that in reality the only real experience 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.940
 of gender equality of gender equality was today which is chibi 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.509
 kids experimenting in school 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.110
 the school does not make great gender distinction 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.699
 pears and therefore in school girls are a bit more study if they are more 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.699
 my good so I can not even better 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.469
 and the frustration in my opinion of women is precisely that of having experienced 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.469
 a parity 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.179
 if and those of having convinced themselves that certain differences were instilled 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.459
 outdated are those linked mega-editorial ones 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.529
 aion indifferent and biological differences 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:16.389
 then reality when one enters adult life these differences if 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.710
 they re-emerge powerful well 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.830
 let me give an example, perhaps the strongest 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.099
 the girls I hired 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.249
 the girls of the south or live in a society that some of them are even though 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.860
 is coming out of 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.870
 by the old regional manager however 3 still culturally a company 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.169
 strongly the 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.630
 convinced of the prominent role differences for women 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.340
 beautiful woman knows at home the courier boss man bringing money home 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.490
 experimenting in the school 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.520
 precisely this equality that also in the south requires 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.069
 come out of school zizi slip back 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.550
 in a society that discriminates 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.550
 here is what I think is one of the problems 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.719
 cultural films that have not yet been passed
