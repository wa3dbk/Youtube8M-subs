mind<00:05:56.930> that<00:05:57.050> your<00:05:57.229> Galaxy<00:05:57.740> Nexus<00:05:58.069> or<00:05:58.339> whatever

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
mind that your Galaxy Nexus or whatever

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.490 
mind that your Galaxy Nexus or whatever
phone<00:05:59.060> you're<00:05:59.330> running<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.839> now<00:05:59.870> looks<00:06:00.289> like<00:06:00.469> a

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
phone you're running it now looks like a

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.420 
phone you're running it now looks like a
Galaxy<00:06:00.949> Nexus<00:06:01.069> on<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.490> Sprint<00:06:01.849> network<00:06:03.099> so<00:06:04.099> if

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
Galaxy Nexus on the Sprint network so if

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.869 
Galaxy Nexus on the Sprint network so if
any<00:06:04.639> application<00:06:06.129> needs<00:06:07.129> that<00:06:07.310> information

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
any application needs that information

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.490 
any application needs that information
that's<00:06:08.089> gonna<00:06:08.330> be<00:06:08.539> different<00:06:08.779> and<00:06:09.169> that<00:06:09.289> can

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
that's gonna be different and that can

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.680 
that's gonna be different and that can
make<00:06:10.099> something<00:06:10.580> else<00:06:10.729> a<00:06:10.879> little<00:06:10.969> wonky<00:06:11.240> so

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
make something else a little wonky so

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.480 
make something else a little wonky so
that's<00:06:11.900> why<00:06:12.560> it's<00:06:12.740> very<00:06:12.919> important<00:06:13.279> to<00:06:13.339> make

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
that's why it's very important to make

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.399 
that's why it's very important to make
sure<00:06:13.520> you<00:06:13.699> have<00:06:13.849> an<00:06:13.969> Android<00:06:14.330> backup<00:06:15.199> as<00:06:15.379> well
