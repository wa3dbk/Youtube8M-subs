80/10/10<00:00:14.460> diet<00:00:15.030> anymore<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.609> originally<00:00:17.609> I

80/10/10 diet anymore so originally I
started<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.350> lifestyle<00:00:19.859> well<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.699> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
started this lifestyle well what I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.080 
started this lifestyle well what I
thought<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> wife<00:00:21.539> style<00:00:22.580> 80/10/10<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
thought was the wife style 80/10/10 and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.490 
thought was the wife style 80/10/10 and
my<00:00:24.779> recommendation<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.250> people<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.500> was

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
my recommendation from some people I was

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.269 
my recommendation from some people I was
told<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.720> emphasize<00:00:30.720> lots<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> sweet<00:00:31.920> fruits

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
told to emphasize lots of sweet fruits

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.229 
told to emphasize lots of sweet fruits
so<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:34.260> getting<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> many<00:00:35.579> calories<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so just getting in as many calories as I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010 
so just getting in as many calories as I
possibly<00:00:36.660> could<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.899> sweet<00:00:37.290> fruits<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> they

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
possibly could on sweet fruits and they

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
possibly could on sweet fruits and they
also<00:00:40.170> said<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.710> vegetables<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.790> feel

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
also said to do vegetables but I feel

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
also said to do vegetables but I feel
like<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> emphasis<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:43.140> definitely<00:00:43.590> on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
like the emphasis was definitely on

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510 
like the emphasis was definitely on
sweet<00:00:44.100> fruits<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> did<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.129> I
