 When playing a game of flight with Yu- chan, for example, this is hard on Nintendo's site 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.030
 Because it is used for the part where it is thrust, it does not appear that the movement can not be guaranteed. 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.410
 Seems to be completely good looking 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.340
