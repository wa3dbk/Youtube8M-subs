00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.260
 yes with finished congratulations 31 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.760
 Formula races 13 podiums this year and 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.470
 you already signed with a big team like 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.369
 mclaren yes the truth thank you very much 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.770
 I'm happy that I can tell you I come to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.170
 the best team in the world with 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.420
 so eager to win championships 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 give everything to all my delivery my heart 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.539
 for for this great championship but for 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
 Now I'm super concentrated on my 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.219
 new in my squad not that gave me the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.859
 Formula 1 entry I want to give you the best 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.199
 the best possible to finish with a 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.909
 victory would be great for me and good 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.219
 I do not want to give you absolutely everything 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.960
 guys alike even if you're focused 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 in knowing that it's obvious because there's a lot 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 to give yet how you received the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.659
 news because it was all very fast 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 also once I was practically 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.370
 dismissed ferrari a team like 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.670
 mclaren that needs you and that's very 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.650
 important if that but important is not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.540
 life is not how you're doing by taking 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.100
 different paths if at the beginning of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.930
 you told me I want to finish the season 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 mclaren had said that you are 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 completely crazy I think the step 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 logical was to go to ferrari look for the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.080
 seat in Ferrari or probably the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 mercedes but never in the mclaren not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.399
 it was never an option for me mclaren 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.049
 I always saw it as a very distant dream 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.570
 even when they contacted me no no I 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.880
 I wanted to hope for a lot but everything went away 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.560
 giving and well I think it has 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.800
 come this opportunity if God has 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.569
 given this opportunity is to get him 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.159
 absolutely everything just a little while ago 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.140
 Lewis Hamilton said he left you a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 perfect car inclusive of the year for the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.259
 next year because it's fine 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.030
 developed so you even have a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 very competitive car to start the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.940
 next year if we absolutely do not have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.280
 a super competitive car a car that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 we owe him to win races with him 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.470
 then that is our main 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.060
 objective I'm super focused on winning 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.649
 the championship next year my 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 partner to a great companion a 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.069
 ideal companion also jenson button 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.689
 because he 's a fast driver too but 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.269
 a very good person apparently and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.019
 no conflicts of Jenson is a great guy 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.640
 he's a great driver I'm lucky not to 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.980
 have a great champion next to me a 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.019
 world champion and good will be super 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.640
 good for me and that also helps you 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.410
 focus differently in this season and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 you have arranged next year in 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.910
 super team and your mind is already focused 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.859
 to this year but it's better because you're already 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.290
 as you discard this is what comes the 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.690
 next year yes absolutely then 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.230
 I want to give it absolutely everything I want 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.150
 finish in the best possible way my 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.280
 season and as I say we have not already 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 done all the only thing left to do 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.470
 Sauber is a victory that I love 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470
 get
