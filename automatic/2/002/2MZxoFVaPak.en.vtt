00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
lot of openings for and 40 express these

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.219 
lot of openings for and 40 express these
various<00:02:01.259> ports<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.579> start<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.140> input<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
various ports so we start to input it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
various ports so we start to input it
here<00:02:04.469> first

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.680 

see<00:02:09.630> am<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:09.960> doing<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.860> now

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
see am i doing this the right way now

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330 
see am i doing this the right way now
yes<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.010> how<00:02:17.220> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
yes so now there we go this is how it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.260 
yes so now there we go this is how it
looks<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.430> then

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
looks like when you put it in and then

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.450 
looks like when you put it in and then
we<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.630> close<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.020> use<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and then of course on the back here we

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.280 
and then of course on the back here we
also<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.250> an<00:03:11.400> opening<00:03:11.790> here<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.209> for<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
also do have an opening here and for the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.390 
also do have an opening here and for the
camera<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.700> I'm<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.120> quad<00:03:15.630> show<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.170> is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
camera and then I'm a quad show that is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.500 
camera and then I'm a quad show that is
but<00:03:17.400> some<00:03:17.910> port<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.090> how<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> looks

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
but some port so this is how it looks

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.430 
but some port so this is how it looks
like<00:03:22.880> magnetic<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:26.570> then<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.690> course<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.170> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
like magnetic and then of course it is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.170 
like magnetic and then of course it is
it<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.400> bit<00:03:29.519> difficult<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:30.030> take

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
it is a little bit difficult to take

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.880 
it is a little bit difficult to take
picture<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.600> course<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.170> open<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.470> fully

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
picture of course if you open it fully

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.180 
picture of course if you open it fully
because<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.180> will<00:03:33.500> come<00:03:34.500> up<00:03:34.739> there<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.130> if

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
because then it will come up there so if

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.350 
because then it will come up there so if
you<00:03:35.280> want<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.519> take<00:03:35.610> pictures<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.150> have<00:03:36.180> to
