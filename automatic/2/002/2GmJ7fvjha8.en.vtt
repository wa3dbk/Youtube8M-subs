 feature features 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.970
 in which 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.869
 to facilitate its administration 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.869
 all information on computers can be penalized 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.140
 group policies can be applied 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.960
 may not be made by increasing pib 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.240
 the folder access control 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.680
 creation of user groups can be done in three factors 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.450
 but before beginning to know each function of this 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 let's know how to get some information our 2008 index 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 The first step we'll take now

 sb has works are highly spoken if it is filed 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.190
 the amount of memory it has processed 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 in flavor this information is very simple 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 click start 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.760
 control panel 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.790
 on icloud system 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.830
 after April and includes

 the hymn version is being used 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.500
 which processed 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.369
 the amount of memory because the whole system rests on 32-bit selmeya 4 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.369
 the server name 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.700
 according to his lawyer 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.650
 we can also deco of the settings 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.620
 clicking here in the encounter with the advanced advanced system 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.340
 I gave these birds 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 Let's meet some 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.170
 computer name 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.380
 it is indispensable 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.360
 Why should I be vital?

 registering the destruction of the accountant and is able to operate the name of the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.550

 not only the name of the buyer but also can not condition the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 computer or mine 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.570
 right 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.929
 athena a working group 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 we also have a basis on what robert is super important 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.129
 if any kind of museum 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.449
 not have a correct drive this academic focus 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.880
 but we can use 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.209
 is the make up your deic insect life 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.070
 but that 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.300
 if you share the 110 to lary if you see some connection to the internet 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.849
 and this other button for send managers for speed 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.339

 if we are speaking properly of each device may 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.029
 in the sports manager

 devices 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 all are installed 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.399
 correctly 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.919
 but then it was properly beauty 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.569
 we do not have things to do 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.469
 has advanced where you can give edge to the user's profile by performance 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.279
 and the remote 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.149
 and it is a very important option 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.379
 Where are you going to be able to access your computer secret? 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 in a way that does not need you physically 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.500
 anywhere on the network 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 the day of communication you can access 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.379
 We know some items 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.319
 is authoring reservations as you can have some information from the hu on the server 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.539
 Let's now know the winners being 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.619
 that by means of recommendations for its new service of accusations 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.679
 and despite diagnosis - it's beautiful 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.620
 It's simple 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.989
 click start 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.299
 an administrative infraction 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 and let's take care and server manager 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.629
 will appear some information 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:43.980
 not the server 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.030
 if it belongs to the group and has worked as the domain of that local conversation of the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.209
 padim pmp 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.910
 it will be a remote job 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.270
 Enablement is enabled. 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.629
 I do not know if it has some function popped or some feature 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.789
 we count on zero action we have nothing 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.029
 speaking functions will know a little more about these functions than on the 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.519
 server may have 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.589
 an additional 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.479
 right 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.589
 we can have 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:10.430
 all abc services 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.720
 the most 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.130
 with the defense well and receives about ten of them formerly not come down 2003 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.180
 we have control of the domain 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.790
 at the end of 2008 no 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.259
 now we have 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.620
 the only service to be called 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.719
 served minho servers 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.240
 It's the people you can be traversed by Mary's web

 you can also traditional from dem is this to do dhcp name reduction 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.610
 for those who knew the mapping closely 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.669
 right 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.430
 and that among other functions 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.139
 I go there with the drought is popular 'our our attack is this 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.139
 Let's go here with these features we can add 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.650
 we can add remote sc that is fundamental 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.670
 What happens if you can succeed in the motorcycle process in a simple way? 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.680

 this item that has the diagnosis that is super important 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.779
 inside it we have some 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.120
 some of them some tools that will help 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.920

 your purpose to perform events occurring on your computer 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.729
 before those that can be 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:12.969
 the money

 the social information network of victory or speaking to victory 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.589
 It's super important that you always see 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:21.510
 your 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.009
 It's very cold, okay. 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.569
 we also have the performance and confidence 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.259
 o dvd graphics 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.199
 and how is your processor your hard drive the network 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.030
 very good memory 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.030
 if you do not want to fully migrate but the percentage 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.189
 and another item we've seen 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:41.249
 the device manager 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.730
 this is the silver analyze 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.610
 all our radars are installed correctly 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.419
 right 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.439
 in configuration but we can 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:54.100
 the sanctions include pain task the beacon of the bus that in a universe in 2008 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.189
 has been completely overhauled 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.659
 now we go to work with ball to paulo he works both with the entrance 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.839
 light output pcb 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.399
 - if I say how to create a rule serves as a dead end services 

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.699
 meeting bohemian users and local groups if you do not use 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.649
 is yours being or not 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.559
 Or do you see Sunday? 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.559
 we also have the storage 

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.039
 to give vent was said after having been better adapted 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.439
 it serves to back up your files 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.669
 It's always good that you have a policy and strategy 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.699
 for decades to be 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.270
 all correctly 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.149
 then while looking at waste management 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.360
 Certain when we can 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.310
 They make excuses to define the cast 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.740
 reality is it does not go from zero to 5 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.889
 they do all this part 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.339
 of your server's insecurity 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.509
 so let's start now 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:56.119
 how to get some information on the server 

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:59.119
 how can we manage the server 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.569
 Let's go to the next classes, what we want 

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:04.309
 a lot more things ahead 

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:06.009
 thank you 

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:06.599
 and see you later
