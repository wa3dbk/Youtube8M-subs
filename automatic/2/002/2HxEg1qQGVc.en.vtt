00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.330
 to me 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.930
 she who is all here is for me 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 the crafter with a new video and finally 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.330
 it's a new video and this time it's with the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.470
 review of a mod is called x king that is 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.600
 for version 1.5 11.52 thank you very much 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.160
 to all those who have supported me and I'm going to 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.620
 continue in this channel with more force than 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.340
 never better than ever good we're going to 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.379
 start the video first of all with a 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.920
 new platform that you have designed that is 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.720
 the technical sheet and good here you see how 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.200
 the ballots of the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.000
 technical fight and as you see to see is for 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.579
 version 1.5 11.52 the properties are 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.270
 with the active key the vision 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.490
 night with the x key active in the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.520
 mineral seeker 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.619
 and the key active ere the search 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.100
 of bots and rector can also say that 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.280
 you activate a cave finder of the two 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.400
 same ones that are below ground 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.600
 my personal rating is 8.5 I think 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.650
 which is quite high for a bot 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.870
 because I usually see them as a 67 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.360
 but good 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:39.220
 let's continue with the compatibility of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 it is not compatible with any 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.250
 similar 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.869
 you also need to take into free 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.460
 of mods to be able to do an installation 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.119
 correct 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 Minecraft clean without any other way 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.140
 things that you put them on but of 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.290
 time to install you need them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 I have that you can not have eyes 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.030
 and then I do not take any charge of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.520
 No case related to the use of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.170
 this loot servers that are public 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.030
 or private as you already know in this way 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 can be used on servers but I do not 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.180
 I take charge of no case since you 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.760
 they can handle or if the case if it is case 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.860
 that you are premium you can remove the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.020
 account or close I take responsibility 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.350
 well let's continue with the installation 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.940
 of this good mod the installation is very 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.060
 simple we just have to go to our 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.790
 browser whatever and copy this 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.290
 link that I leave in the description 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.720
 whole and will redirect us to this page 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.580
 Minecraft forum website the only thing that 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.550
 we have what we have to do is give it 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.250
 here download 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.370
 and it will direct us to this page and here what 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.020
 what we have to do is give it here 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.320
 we will wait 5 seconds because it is atf 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.320
 live 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.890
 and just give jump advertising is us 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.420
 I'll download here, well, I'm not going 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.880
 to move to the desk because I already have it 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.520
 I have it here good because the following is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.580
 very simple we only start by 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.440
 percent app data percent for those who 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.950
 have windows xp or it will come out here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 execute and I'll put it is the same roaming and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.750
 point minecraft I repeat that you have to 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.420
 be free in any way to do it 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.270
 you can delete the bin folder go to your 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.770
 Minecraft 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.690
 and when opening it give force of dead vale 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.190
 It is very simple 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.730
 we go with the installation we go to the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.430
 bin minecraft folder right click to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.380
 open with and winrar archiver then 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.470
 here the first thing we should do 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.720
 is to delete the folder me time because if 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.160
 no we can not install the mod we will see 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.600
 the the winrar of the mod and we will pass this from 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.480
 here we must accept until it 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.750
 let us know we will have it past and salted 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.069
 very simple easy to install and very 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.969
 useful let's go through the review of the mod 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.370
 well let's go through the review first we 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:20.459
 let's create a new world we 're going to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.160
 put in creative and we will create it 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.980
 let's hope it is believed normally 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.990
 it takes a little 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.750
 it depends on the good computer already what 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.040
 we have and we will see what it is about 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.710
 mod 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.160
 first let's teach the lx king 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.129
 ok it's with the x key and well if you 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.029
 we give the key x this happens 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:47.940
 As you can see, all the minerals are 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:50.820
 come all for example we started to sting 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.700
 we remove the X and we give 1 and we see 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.340
 the mineral that we had seen before if 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.250
 we want more survival because we do not 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.920
 we put and we go for the diamond 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.410
 that it would be would be lower but this 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.020
 dan are not all their functions too 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.340
 has the function 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.310
 to find caves of mobs materials and 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.090
 maps we give the key ere and as you see 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.250
 the materials the mods and the caves of 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.169
 mods you have it down there if you do not 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.280
 what you are down there is also seen 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.199
 Magna almost everything you could damage 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.629
 you have the clippers down there then and 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.040
 you can appreciate it there the cave of the 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:34.310
 ways 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.590
 good is a very simple way and it comes 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.220
 with one more thing that is the vision 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.400
 night we are going to put the time of 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.720
 night time set 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.660
 we go 15,000 but 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.390
 As you can see it is night and if we go 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.880
 near the water that right here is 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.800
 we do not see it very well because the only thing 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.110
 we have to do is give the key l 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.320
 and as you can see we have everything there 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.020
 below we will see everything very well even if 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.940
 at night as you can see we see all the 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.190
 background and that also serves well by 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.030
 example is being excavated let's remove 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.110
 he is digging you want to find 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.310
 some mineral you are really starting to finish 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:23.070
 perfect you can finish and then no 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.530
 you see you do not see anything oil and instead of 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.140
 put torches you give to the l and as 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.110
 You see it will be like it's daytime because it's 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.740
 very simply but very sencillito 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.480
 very good and very useful as I said before 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.700
 I do not take care that you use in 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.260
 that servers of the hunger games ' 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.850
 either from any server because you 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.440
 can you drive I hope you have 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.540
 liked the video 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.910
 and see you I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.270
 my return and see you in my next 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.960
 goodbye video 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.960
 all right
