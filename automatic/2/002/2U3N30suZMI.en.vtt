00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.180
 Red Steelers is further than 90 and 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.559
 that was the recycling 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.549
 Cicor on my toes I felt left out 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.019
 and genders have been on this game 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.320
 because the multiplayer will surely be super and that's good too that today 

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.779
 Percent means joining the multiplayer game 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.529
 Tennis is commented 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.019
 for tech stocks 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.789
 under van Vliet HK 21 not quite sure that Heckler &amp; Koch 21 now has yet 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.909
 look up 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.810
 pointing to the case would be the right one 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.390
 and I use percent for the first time of the year 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.780
 rocket launcher 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 and that's not as strong as it used to be 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.530
 and even if later fooled and also kept 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 and I still do not know the cards anyone who has not got the campaign yet 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.370
 played 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.920
 and right here is a little miracle 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.770
 I cried lightweight and tactic mask 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 I still have very little unlocked 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.400
 Plastal 5 or something 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.290
 and most guests are leaving 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.930
 under which 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.680
 percentage 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.770
 What is more important is that we are only now giving it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.640
 accordingly many points 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.700
 So this Chardonnay has done to the words 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.730
 This is 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.320
 Percent yes not right 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.900
 It's important that the site comes from us for that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.330
 No, I have that 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 he bought a felony named Sophie who scored points over the damage 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.450
 so if you advise them 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 decorated by long shot 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.840
 there are processes 20 points but we're not getting eighty to fast 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.190
 Kehl Basler almost Roth threw me 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.710
 And yes, the great thing is that we are on the right path and looking very much 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.940
 beautiful 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.630
 and around 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.190
 he shot himself 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 would like to model my 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.649
 Plane post 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.709
 the opponent's position also reveals that age has not clarified 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.750
 in between is surprised that another came 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 and yes percent I can not say it, I practically did not do it myself 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.080
 choose 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 I have him also the percent of the offspring 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.960
 that somebody will be displayed as well after the 1's the special company he becomes 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.470
 in the crosshairs and played cards 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.619
 from the simple code its time 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.079
 and around 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.959
 Iro exactly what primeval aircraft and supplies and the first-time noticeable 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 Graduation and work is no longer I have not yet managed 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.789
 I'm still not sure if I'm really familiar with it 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.789
 and even then one does not come up 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.499
 Mark Polak also shot down that and 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.939
 that was just the Zuleger we finally spy plane 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.609
 and wait for you very much that they come 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:45.999
 and percent 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.949
 Dr Lässig actually like that 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.049
 because who wants to have looked like but no if I see that I come here 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.139
 then around the corner 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.059
 I'm still waiting 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.449
 around 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.179
 the bottom line is the case 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.039
 Precht alright 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.329
 even if it's subtle like a special reason why I'm so good at the end 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.089
 László Andor 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.099
 and pretty bad the target of 44 small percent 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.730
 Sight glass narrative light machine gun 30 rounds or so 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.529
 CAD seen it went very wrong 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.699
 and that coolly called Sniper Percent 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.699
 Nevertheless, the 14-year-old son Saad must lie 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.619
 percent 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.209
 therefore 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.309
 it may be our goal 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.729
 Russian counter 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.759
 but 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.349
 Now it's finally time 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.269
 by the way, by the way 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.599
 Thilo Bode except her is called 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.289
 very good feature you can see the last few games i think from the last one 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.039
 Week even 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.379
 she can just look at it again 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.689
 and 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.099
 the slow motion play fast forward 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.869
 in Volkersen 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:01.329
 not everyone can enter the city hall and 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.459
 At last, that has kept it waiting because the festival has not yet seen 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.929
 Festival of Lights best when it happens 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.299
 and there is 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.299
 I'll then finally shut down supplies 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.889
 Mannings had it at 5 Kehl Z2 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.359
 and JAL about what's going on in her, it's definitely awesome 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.389
 at the first episode by luck 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.900
 between combat helicopter 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.999
 Percent of people did it with the 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.349
 hopefully it will come for a while then a few days arrive 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.590
 but it is 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.419
 protected because of the helicopter with the Dettling 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.229
 and he just has that too 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.129
 a bit bad at the beginning 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.090
 but ultimately goalkeeper important event 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.030
 which monument occupied on the map tour so suddenly very many places 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.830
 RPO one can hide 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.830
 a little bit like me with the percent Pepsi 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.449
 Euro upwards 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.199
 on the Qatar Masters or something so he sees himself barely before hiding 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:06.369
 and that's why I'll probably theirs that's not it's important here 

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:07.449
 win 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.559
 The city of Bielefeld wanted to see it anyway, but it was cool 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.559
 If you do not like it, you should be otherwise 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.409
 weighty easy view is forgiven 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.759
 he sits protectively 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.009
 and yes he is the last one we need right away 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.089
 Forum for problems I hope you liked it Rudi is also watching 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.169
 excessive 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.180
 which way the video though 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.070
 he rated commented for me, first forward
