00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.469
 she as head of the flight az 063 ci 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.660
 tells what his role was as 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.960
 crew coordinator 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 in the accident go over all the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.820
 procedures to be a point of reference 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 both for sending crew and for 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.369
 passengers and therefore accordingly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.950
 coordinate all operations 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.649
 when the commander gave the signal 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.620
 emergency landing which is 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.300
 it was his thought but look I am 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.320
 20 years that I do this job then 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.500
 and no growth has ever happened and o 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:49.810
 very confident in the skill of the pilots 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.040
 and in collaboration with colleagues e 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.350
 this was a very important thing 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.030
 because it calms a lot beyond the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.190
 fact that we have not prepared therefore 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 every criticality is already completely studied a 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.119
 dot and we're prepared to do it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.119
 so also the emotional part was 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.799
 very important for this as a woman 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.350
 flight attendant 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.319
 what were his thoughts to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.749
 moment of ground impact 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:19.140
 but look at that moment it's not done 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.850
 difference between walking woman 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.389
 foreign Italian passenger in that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 moment the thought goes to the community that 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:32.110
 he has there with us on board and of course 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.570
 the importance lies in making clear 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.210
 messages that we know they must 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.990
 get clear or positions from 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.689
 to hire 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 to refresh which ones succeeded more 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.170
 nearby there is no space at that time 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.580
 for other thoughts I assure you 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.770
 can you tell us if you were quiet in the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 time of landing and stefano is 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 he was also very good he still has to 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.560
 spread this tranquility that in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.360
 reality at that time served because 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.460
 however, experience counts when 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 unfortunately these things happen that this 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.160
 type of training this type of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.560
 simulation of a cart that does not open 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.110
 she has never practiced it in the simulator 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.090
 within the training of di 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 alitalia 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.990
 absolutely yes I had 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.770
 the opportunity to practice this type 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.380
 failure of the flight simulator 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.830
 we have very advanced simulators that 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.660
 allow you to replicate very faithfully 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.760
 what the flight itself must indeed 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.299
 say that during 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.900
 the 29 September landing 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.530
 I saw just what was happening 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.720
 exactly even for what 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.329
 concerns the physical sensation of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.099
 movement because the simulators have the 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.250
 ability to move and transmit 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.500
 also the physical sensations to the drivers and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.110
 so it is faithfully reproduced what 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.790
 I had already approved the simulator 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.250
 commander how many times he repeats it in a 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.900
 year this type of failure 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.480
 look I remember once having it 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.870
 made recently I am so many years 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.370
 that flight and that has me right then 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.920
 what was better was chin 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.590
 the last time I practiced it 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.470
 before the accident 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.060
 obviously over the years it has repeated more 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.310
 but once there are programs 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.349
 specific to the simulator and obvious that not 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.200
 we are always there doing the same thing 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.690
 there are a multitude of failures that 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.599
 we have to reproduce and simulate on 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.700
 which we have to train for which also 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.280
 this was done in the ambit of 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.220
 as part of the planned programs such as 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.040
 was his role as first official 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.359
 we immediately integrated reading then 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.370
 it is not that one reads the other listens 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.410
 we read together physically ho 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
 I read but he checked that i 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.000
 exactly what matters 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.049
 we did the maneuvers together when 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.639
 we realized that actually 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.359
 the cart went down we started 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.410
 to coordinate to address the 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.180
 emergency procedure either 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.680
 landing afterwards 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.479
 so we complained several times 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.130
 maneuvers to do during landing is 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.220
 once film those occasions 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.580
 passengers and everything 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.320
 the last question is why ritual had 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.090
 fear 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.789
 I was afraid after we landed 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.300
 actually when I left the Roma or 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.570
 bill and I tried this feeling of 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.070
 here is relief but a past fear 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.810
 I don't know how to explain it 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.250
 during the flight I repeat there was not really 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.470
 time to think about fear or that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.260
 I was very concentrated with loris 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.150
 we had to do many things 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.010
 we had to be sure it wasn't there 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.750
 way to lower this cart 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.700
 we had to be sure the cabin 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.470
 behind us with passengers i 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.600
 fellow flight attendants were 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.670
 ready to be made all 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.310
 briefing preparation procedures 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.340
 to then face let's say the part 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.960
 final of this event that was always 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.120
 an unknown for as many as possible 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.530
 developments 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.460
 thanks commander good luck for 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.460
 his profession
