matching game similar to other color
matching<00:00:07.919> games<00:00:08.130> but<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> idea<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> mix

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
matching games but the idea is to mix

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.209 
matching games but the idea is to mix
your<00:00:09.780> current<00:00:10.110> color<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> paint's<00:00:11.160> that

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
your current color with the paint's that

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.879 
your current color with the paint's that
are<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> board<00:00:12.049> so<00:00:13.049> every<00:00:13.290> turn<00:00:13.530> you're

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
are on the board so every turn you're

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.890 
are on the board so every turn you're
given<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.219> new<00:00:14.340> color<00:00:14.610> right<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.570> can<00:00:15.780> see

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
given a new color right now you can see

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
given a new color right now you can see
that<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.139> current<00:00:16.170> color<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> yellow<00:00:16.920> we're

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
that our current color is yellow we're

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.830 
that our current color is yellow we're
going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> mix<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.330> those<00:00:18.539> three

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
going to mix that with those three

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to mix that with those three
greens<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> board<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.609> mixing

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
greens you see on the board the mixing

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.550 
greens you see on the board the mixing
guide<00:00:21.119> shows<00:00:21.449> us<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.810> mixing<00:00:22.140> yellow<00:00:22.289> into

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
guide shows us that mixing yellow into

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
guide shows us that mixing yellow into
green<00:00:22.740> makes<00:00:22.980> yellow<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.789> let's<00:00:23.939> tap<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> once

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
green makes yellow so let's tap it once

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
green makes yellow so let's tap it once
to<00:00:24.750> preview<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> mix<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:26.310> we'll<00:00:26.430> tap<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to preview the mix and then we'll tap it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.209 
to preview the mix and then we'll tap it
a<00:00:26.849> second<00:00:27.210> time<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:28.109> execute<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.710> mix<00:00:34.070> our<00:00:35.070> new

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a second time to execute the mix our new

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
a second time to execute the mix our new
color<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> red<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.329> mix<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> into

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
color is red so if we mix that into

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
color is red so if we mix that into
those<00:00:37.079> three<00:00:37.350> blues<00:00:37.620> it'll<00:00:37.980> form<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> match

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
those three blues it'll form a match

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:50.460 
those three blues it'll form a match
with<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> purple<00:00:39.180> there<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.989> let's<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.660 

you'll<00:00:51.470> notice<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.830> couple<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.160> water<00:00:52.340> drops

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
you'll notice a couple of water drops

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.830 
you'll notice a couple of water drops
have<00:00:52.850> appeared<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.360> left-hand<00:00:53.750> side

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
have appeared on the left-hand side

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.350 
have appeared on the left-hand side
water<00:00:54.800> drop<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.220> special<00:00:55.640> item<00:00:55.910> when<00:00:56.210> it's

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
water drop is a special item when it's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.850 
water drop is a special item when it's
matched<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.870> will<00:00:56.960> eliminate<00:00:57.170> all<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.650> pieces

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
matched it will eliminate all the pieces

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.560 
matched it will eliminate all the pieces
around<00:00:58.280> it

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.300 

higher<00:01:05.570> levels<00:01:06.020> Brown<00:01:06.290> pieces<00:01:06.740> will<00:01:06.920> start<00:01:06.950> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
higher levels Brown pieces will start to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.250 
higher levels Brown pieces will start to
drop<00:01:07.490> into<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.910> board<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.960> see<00:01:09.110> that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
drop into the board you can see that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.780 
drop into the board you can see that
each<00:01:09.380> ground<00:01:09.680> paint<00:01:09.979> piece<00:01:10.220> has<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.460> center

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
each ground paint piece has a center

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.790 
each ground paint piece has a center
color<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.720> can't<00:01:11.960> change<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.350> color<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.680> a

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
color you can't change the color of a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.380 
color you can't change the color of a
brown<00:01:13.010> piece<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.610> can<00:01:13.760> match<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.150> center

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
brown piece but you can match the center

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.420 
brown piece but you can match the center
color<00:01:14.570> with<00:01:14.780> others<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.800> look<00:01:15.950> at<00:01:16.010> this<00:01:16.160> orange

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
color with others so look at this orange

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.219 
color with others so look at this orange
piece<00:01:16.610> if<00:01:16.790> we<00:01:16.940> mix<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.360> yellow<00:01:17.660> into<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.050> red

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
piece if we mix this yellow into the red

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.770 
piece if we mix this yellow into the red
it<00:01:18.770> will<00:01:18.950> match<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.310> those<00:01:19.460> oranges<00:01:25.780> one

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it will match with those oranges one

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.420 
it will match with those oranges one
thing<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.020> look<00:01:27.140> out<00:01:27.290> for<00:01:27.590> said<00:01:28.130> if<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.310> don't

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
thing to look out for said if you don't

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.370 
thing to look out for said if you don't
eliminate<00:01:28.670> brown<00:01:29.150> paint<00:01:29.479> quickly<00:01:29.869> enough<00:01:30.110> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
eliminate brown paint quickly enough it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.560 
eliminate brown paint quickly enough it
will<00:01:30.710> spread<00:01:31.009> as<00:01:31.250> it's<00:01:31.759> about<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.000> do<00:01:32.240> here

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
will spread as it's about to do here

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.570 
will spread as it's about to do here
notice<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:33.710> spread<00:01:34.009> around<00:01:34.130> all<00:01:34.430> those

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
notice that it's spread around all those

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.550 
notice that it's spread around all those
other<00:01:34.790> pieces<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.330> were<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.660> board

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.900 

let's<00:01:39.560> take<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> look<00:01:40.009> at<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.190> time<00:01:40.399> mode<00:01:40.670> now

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
let's take a look at the time mode now

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.240 
let's take a look at the time mode now
setting<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.020> ridiculous<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:43.160> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
setting it to ridiculous so that the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.359 
setting it to ridiculous so that the
timer<00:01:43.490> will<00:01:43.729> count<00:01:43.910> down<00:01:44.000> quickly<00:01:48.190> one<00:01:49.190> thing

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
timer will count down quickly one thing

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.889 
timer will count down quickly one thing
you'll<00:01:49.520> notice<00:01:49.729> differently<00:01:50.270> about<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.690> time

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
you'll notice differently about the time

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.660 
you'll notice differently about the time
mode<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.800> progress<00:01:52.160> bar<00:01:52.399> is<00:01:52.520> now<00:01:52.640> a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
mode is that the progress bar is now a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.910 
mode is that the progress bar is now a
timer<00:01:53.000> bar<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.450> counts<00:01:53.750> down<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.770> make

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
timer bar that counts down as you make

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.740 
timer bar that counts down as you make
matches<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.520> refills<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> bar<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.569> better

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
matches it refills the bar the better

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.370 
matches it refills the bar the better
the<00:01:56.929> match<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.440> more<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:57.679> refills

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.899 

but<00:02:03.380> watch<00:02:03.560> out<00:02:03.799> take<00:02:04.310> too<00:02:04.460> long<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.640> make<00:02:04.880> a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.029 
but watch out take too long to make a
move<00:02:05.210> your<00:02:05.719> timer<00:02:05.990> could<00:02:06.229> run<00:02:06.409> out<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.950> you'll

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
move your timer could run out and you'll

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.880 
move your timer could run out and you'll
lose<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.490> game

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.750 

finally<00:02:13.890> let's<00:02:14.160> take<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> look<00:02:14.580> at<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
finally let's take a look at the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.180 
finally let's take a look at the
two-player<00:02:15.120> mode

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
two-player mode

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.110 
two-player mode
two-player<00:02:17.190> mode<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.520> best<00:02:17.700> played<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
two-player mode is best played on a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.330 
two-player mode is best played on a
table<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.720> between<00:02:19.020> two<00:02:19.200> players<00:02:19.530> set<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.220> like

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
table in between two players set up like

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040 
table in between two players set up like
a<00:02:20.370> chessboard<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.420> gonna<00:02:21.540> turn<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> sideways

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
a chessboard I'm gonna turn it sideways

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.320 
a chessboard I'm gonna turn it sideways
so<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.470> can<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.740> what's<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:22.980> on<00:02:23.310> you'll<00:02:24.270> see

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
so we can see what's going on you'll see

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.820 
so we can see what's going on you'll see
that<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> board<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.020> divided<00:02:25.320> into<00:02:25.590> two

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that the board is divided into two

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.590 
that the board is divided into two
halves<00:02:26.100> each<00:02:26.460> player<00:02:26.820> gets<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.180> play<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.450> their

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
halves each player gets to play on their

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.910 
halves each player gets to play on their
own<00:02:27.690> half<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> can't<00:02:28.440> play<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.770> their
