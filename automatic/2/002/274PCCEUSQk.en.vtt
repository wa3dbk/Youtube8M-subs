again<00:00:05.720> everybody<00:00:06.130> yesterday<00:00:07.130> I<00:00:07.160> shared<00:00:07.520> a

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
again everybody yesterday I shared a

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.379 
again everybody yesterday I shared a
video<00:00:08.030> about<00:00:08.710> making<00:00:09.710> an<00:00:09.920> incubator<00:00:10.430> using

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
video about making an incubator using

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.750 
video about making an incubator using
perlite<00:00:11.959> as<00:00:12.200> a<00:00:12.680> hatching<00:00:13.129> substrate<00:00:15.760> some

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
perlite as a hatching substrate some

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.749 
perlite as a hatching substrate some
people<00:00:17.060> really<00:00:17.869> like<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.320> perlite<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.310> other

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
people really like the perlite and other

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.490 
people really like the perlite and other
people<00:00:20.179> don't<00:00:20.330> really<00:00:20.599> care<00:00:20.810> for<00:00:20.840> it<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:21.380> I'd

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
people don't really care for it so I'd

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.650 
people don't really care for it so I'd
like<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:21.769> give<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.070> an<00:00:22.310> alternative<00:00:22.539> to<00:00:23.539> that

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
like to give you an alternative to that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.929 
like to give you an alternative to that
some<00:00:24.589> of<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:24.800> reasons<00:00:25.160> people<00:00:25.490> don't<00:00:25.730> really

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
some of the reasons people don't really

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.650 
some of the reasons people don't really
care<00:00:26.240> for<00:00:26.300> perlite<00:00:26.900> is<00:00:27.169> that<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:29.210> know<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:29.539> an

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
care for perlite is that you know in an

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.770 
care for perlite is that you know in an
incubator<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.349> want<00:00:30.499> to<00:00:30.619> keep<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:31.009> as<00:00:31.780> moist

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
incubator you want to keep it as moist

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.700 
incubator you want to keep it as moist
as<00:00:33.050> possible<00:00:33.650> without<00:00:33.800> getting<00:00:34.010> overly<00:00:34.760> damp

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
as possible without getting overly damp

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.250 
as possible without getting overly damp
and<00:00:36.710> when<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.100> have<00:00:37.480> perlite<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:38.900> kind<00:00:39.200> of

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
and when you have perlite it's kind of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.220 
and when you have perlite it's kind of
hard<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.500> tell<00:00:39.770> like<00:00:40.390> exactly<00:00:41.390> how<00:00:41.540> damp<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:42.080> is

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
hard to tell like exactly how damp it is

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.860 
hard to tell like exactly how damp it is
just<00:00:42.620> by<00:00:42.740> looking<00:00:42.770> at<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.490> you<00:00:43.700> know<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:44.660> is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
just by looking at it you know this is

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.940 
just by looking at it you know this is
perlite<00:00:45.260> dry

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
perlite dry

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.210 
perlite dry
this<00:00:46.400> is<00:00:46.580> perlite<00:00:46.940> wet<00:00:47.150> and<00:00:47.740> they<00:00:48.740> look<00:00:48.980> almost

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
this is perlite wet and they look almost

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.120 
this is perlite wet and they look almost
the<00:00:49.490> same<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:50.510> dry<00:00:50.900> just<00:00:50.960> moves<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.680> little<00:00:51.950> bit

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
the same the dry just moves a little bit

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.420 
the same the dry just moves a little bit
more<00:00:52.310> freely<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:54.020> moist<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.950> actually<00:00:55.280> have

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
more freely the moist you actually have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.310 
more freely the moist you actually have
to<00:00:55.550> stick<00:00:55.760> your<00:00:55.880> finger<00:00:56.240> in<00:00:56.390> there<00:00:56.570> or<00:00:56.870> invest

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
to stick your finger in there or invest

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.680 
to stick your finger in there or invest
in<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.650> hygrometer<00:00:58.070> which<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.150> humidity

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
in a hygrometer which is a humidity

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.410 
in a hygrometer which is a humidity
gauge<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:01.280> put<00:01:01.490> inside<00:01:01.910> of<00:01:02.180> your<00:01:02.420> incubator

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
gauge to put inside of your incubator

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.640 
gauge to put inside of your incubator
and<00:01:05.420> some<00:01:05.750> people<00:01:06.020> just<00:01:06.200> don't<00:01:06.350> trust

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and some people just don't trust

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.790 
and some people just don't trust
themselves<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.640> know<00:01:07.820> enough<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.440> know<00:01:09.560> just

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
themselves to know enough you know just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.880 
themselves to know enough you know just
by<00:01:09.950> touching<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.880> how<00:01:11.510> moist<00:01:12.020> it<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.770> lot

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
by touching it how moist it is and a lot

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.170 
by touching it how moist it is and a lot
of<00:01:13.010> people<00:01:13.280> don't<00:01:13.400> like<00:01:13.520> sticking<00:01:13.940> their

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
of people don't like sticking their

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.330 
of people don't like sticking their
hands<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.630> incubator<00:01:14.930> any<00:01:15.470> more<00:01:16.010> often

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
hands in the incubator any more often

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.980 
hands in the incubator any more often
than<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.240> that's<00:01:17.330> probably<00:01:17.810> a

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
than you have to and that's probably a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950 
than you have to and that's probably a
pretty<00:01:18.020> good<00:01:18.260> policy<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:20.300> instead<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
pretty good policy so instead of the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.649 
pretty good policy so instead of the
perlite<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:23.270> can<00:01:23.450> look<00:01:23.570> into<00:01:23.960> using<00:01:25.659> aquatic

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
perlite you can look into using aquatic

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.430 
perlite you can look into using aquatic
planting<00:01:27.140> soil<00:01:27.440> or<00:01:27.740> aquatic<00:01:28.220> potting<00:01:28.700> soil

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
planting soil or aquatic potting soil

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.920 
planting soil or aquatic potting soil
the<00:01:30.440> stuff<00:01:30.710> is<00:01:30.860> pretty<00:01:31.040> cool<00:01:31.370> it's<00:01:31.930> just

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
the stuff is pretty cool it's just

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.990 
the stuff is pretty cool it's just
diatomaceous<00:01:33.560> earth<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:34.490> kind<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:34.970> a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
diatomaceous earth it's kind of like a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.530 
diatomaceous earth it's kind of like a
clay<00:01:35.390> substance<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.400> really<00:01:37.820> porous<00:01:38.240> so

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
clay substance and it's really porous so

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.860 
clay substance and it's really porous so
it<00:01:38.659> holds<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.990> lot<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.170> water<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:41.659> makes

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
it holds a lot of water and that makes

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.640 
it holds a lot of water and that makes
it<00:01:42.080> pretty<00:01:42.320> much<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.370> ideal<00:01:44.650> incubating

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
it pretty much the ideal incubating

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.010 
it pretty much the ideal incubating
material<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:47.570> used<00:01:47.990> in<00:01:48.320> like<00:01:48.950> koi<00:01:49.159> ponds<00:01:49.490> and

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
material it's used in like koi ponds and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.830 
material it's used in like koi ponds and
it<00:01:51.020> provides<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:52.010> good<00:01:52.220> root<00:01:52.909> system<00:01:52.940> or<00:01:53.750> a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it provides a good root system or a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.899 
it provides a good root system or a
place<00:01:54.080> for<00:01:54.590> aquatic<00:01:55.100> plants<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.580> put<00:01:55.760> their

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
place for aquatic plants to put their

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.590 
place for aquatic plants to put their
roots<00:01:56.140> for<00:01:57.140> koi<00:01:57.560> fish<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:58.010> lay<00:01:58.130> their<00:01:58.310> eggs<00:02:01.600> you

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
roots for koi fish to lay their eggs you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.590 
roots for koi fish to lay their eggs you
can<00:02:02.750> find<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.140> at<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:04.280> plant<00:02:04.610> nurseries<00:02:05.240> if

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
can find it at like plant nurseries if

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.300 
can find it at like plant nurseries if
you're<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.350> have<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.500> good<00:02:06.740> local<00:02:07.070> plant

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
you're you have a good local plant

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.719 
you're you have a good local plant
nursery<00:02:07.850> or<00:02:08.739> some<00:02:09.739> home<00:02:09.920> improvement<00:02:10.459> stores

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
nursery or some home improvement stores

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.209 
nursery or some home improvement stores
carry<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.379> cool<00:02:12.560> thing<00:02:12.590> about<00:02:12.889> that

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
carry it and the cool thing about that

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.849 
carry it and the cool thing about that
is<00:02:13.909> that<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.779> is<00:02:14.989> what<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.260> looks<00:02:15.439> like<00:02:15.529> when

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
is that this is what it looks like when

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.820 
is that this is what it looks like when
it's<00:02:16.040> dry

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it's dry

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.930 
it's dry
but<00:02:18.830> that's<00:02:19.040> what<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.340> looks<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.610> when<00:02:19.820> it's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
but that's what it looks like when it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.570 
but that's what it looks like when it's
wet<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:21.070> can<00:02:22.070> really<00:02:22.280> tell<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.490> difference

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
wet you can really tell the difference

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.000 
wet you can really tell the difference
just<00:02:23.270> by<00:02:23.420> looking<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.170> whether<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:24.710> not

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
just by looking at it whether or not

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.850 
just by looking at it whether or not
it's<00:02:25.280> got<00:02:25.460> enough<00:02:25.730> moisture<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.860> and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's got enough moisture in it and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.710 
it's got enough moisture in it and
that's<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.160> big<00:02:28.340> bonus<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:29.000> lot<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.330> people

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's a big bonus for a lot of people

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.120 
that's a big bonus for a lot of people
they<00:02:29.840> don't<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> mess<00:02:30.470> with<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.770> lid

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
they don't have to mess with the lid

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.440 
they don't have to mess with the lid
they<00:02:31.400> don't<00:02:31.550> have<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.760> stick<00:02:31.940> their<00:02:32.090> fingers

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
they don't have to stick their fingers

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.650 
they don't have to stick their fingers
in<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.830> much<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.100> an<00:02:34.490> issue<00:02:35.090> when

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
in it it's not so much of an issue when

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.440 
in it it's not so much of an issue when
you<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:35.810> an<00:02:36.530> incubator<00:02:37.160> that's<00:02:37.760> completely

almost because once that little egg like

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.310 
almost because once that little egg like
opens<00:03:29.360> up<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.660> there<00:03:29.810> there's<00:03:30.019> going<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.200> be

opens up in there there's going to be

egg goo in there and that's potential
for<00:03:34.220> mold<00:03:34.790> growth<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:37.220> want<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.549> clean

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
for mold growth so you want to clean

that<00:03:37.910> stuff<00:03:38.060> out<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.570> want<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.840> get<00:03:38.989> rid<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.320> it

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
that stuff out you want to get rid of it

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.650 
that stuff out you want to get rid of it
after<00:03:39.890> you've<00:03:40.040> had<00:03:40.220> an<00:03:40.610> egg<00:03:40.820> or<00:03:40.970> two<00:03:41.030> hatch<00:03:41.390> in

after you've had an egg or two hatch in

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.110 
after you've had an egg or two hatch in
there<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.080> gets<00:03:42.260> pretty<00:03:42.650> nasty<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.820> gets

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
there it gets pretty nasty and it gets

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.949 
there it gets pretty nasty and it gets
discolored<00:03:44.780> looking<00:03:45.489> mildewy<00:03:46.489> kind<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.120> at

discolored looking mildewy kind of at
room<00:03:48.320> temperature<00:03:48.920> which<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.220> want<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.549> be

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
room temperature which you want to be

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
keeping these eggs at not really an easy

way<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.230> clean<00:03:54.680> perlite<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.820> just<00:03:56.000> dump<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.480> so

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
way to clean perlite you just dump it so

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.380 
way to clean perlite you just dump it so
it's<00:03:57.230> kind<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.590> wasteful<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.640> go<00:03:58.820> through<00:03:59.120> you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
it's kind of wasteful you go through you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.150 
it's kind of wasteful you go through you
could<00:03:59.630> go<00:03:59.810> through<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.079> lot<00:04:00.320> every<00:04:00.709> year<00:04:01.010> if

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
could go through a lot every year if

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.289 
could go through a lot every year if
you're<00:04:01.400> raising<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.940> lot<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.150> eggs<00:04:04.120> with<00:04:05.120> the

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
you're raising a lot of eggs with the

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.770 
you're raising a lot of eggs with the
pond<00:04:05.660> soil<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.590> just<00:04:06.920> boil<00:04:07.160> it<00:04:07.400> up<00:04:07.780> after

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
pond soil you can just boil it up after

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.350 
pond soil you can just boil it up after
you've<00:04:08.930> been<00:04:09.110> using<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.829> reuse<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.940> it's

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
you've been using it and reuse it it's

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.780 
you've been using it and reuse it it's
really<00:04:11.750> sturdy<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:13.130> doesn't<00:04:13.430> really<00:04:13.549> break

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
really sturdy it doesn't really break

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.650 
really sturdy it doesn't really break
down<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.720> it's<00:04:15.620> not<00:04:16.519> wasteful<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.450> just

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
down so it's not wasteful you can just

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.979 
down so it's not wasteful you can just
reuse<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.229> I<00:04:18.410> mean<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> bag<00:04:20.299> like<00:04:20.540> this<00:04:20.600> you

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
reuse it I mean get a bag like this you

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.210 
reuse it I mean get a bag like this you
could<00:04:21.109> even<00:04:21.260> share<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:21.769> some<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.130> your

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.190 
sucking it in and the water in the bowl
is<00:05:36.430> looking<00:05:36.910> pretty<00:05:37.120> murky<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:37.930> pretty

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
is looking pretty murky it's pretty

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.410 
is looking pretty murky it's pretty
cloudy<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.610> just<00:05:39.820> shows<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.150> there's<00:05:40.330> a

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
cloudy and it just shows you there's a

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.480 
cloudy and it just shows you there's a
lot<00:05:40.570> of<00:05:40.690> dust<00:05:40.870> that<00:05:41.110> comes<00:05:41.320> off<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.800> so<00:05:42.430> I

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
lot of dust that comes off of it so I

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.000 
lot of dust that comes off of it so I
have<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.700> do<00:05:42.910> is<00:05:43.060> run<00:05:43.390> water<00:05:44.110> over<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.710> for<00:05:44.980> a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
have to do is run water over it for a

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.540 
have to do is run water over it for a
while<00:05:45.900> let<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:47.020> drip<00:05:47.350> until<00:05:48.280> it's<00:05:48.430> not

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
while let it drip until it's not

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.300 
while let it drip until it's not
dripping<00:05:49.210> any<00:05:49.540> more<00:05:49.810> and<00:05:50.110> then<00:05:50.920> you<00:05:51.040> can<00:05:51.160> just

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
dripping any more and then you can just

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.340 
dripping any more and then you can just
put<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:51.580> right<00:05:51.700> into<00:05:51.910> your<00:05:52.030> incubator<00:05:52.540> just

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
put it right into your incubator just

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.930 
put it right into your incubator just
like<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.650> would<00:05:53.770> do<00:05:53.890> with<00:05:53.919> the<00:05:54.130> perlite<00:05:54.550> about

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
like you would do with the perlite about

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.640 
like you would do with the perlite about
the<00:05:55.090> same<00:05:55.300> level<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:55.840> then<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.050> just<00:05:56.260> lay<00:05:56.470> the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
the same level and then you just lay the

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.310 
the same level and then you just lay the
eggs<00:05:56.800> right<00:05:57.130> on<00:05:57.160> top<00:05:57.520> of<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:58.600> aquatic<00:05:59.050> potting

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
eggs right on top of the aquatic potting

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.680 
eggs right on top of the aquatic potting
soil<00:05:59.500> just<00:05:59.800> like<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.100> would<00:06:00.250> have<00:06:00.460> with<00:06:00.790> the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
soil just like you would have with the

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.260 
soil just like you would have with the
perlite

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.600 

so<00:06:06.270> anyway<00:06:06.600> here<00:06:07.020> are<00:06:07.070> two<00:06:08.070> completed

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
so anyway here are two completed

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.700 
so anyway here are two completed
incubators<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.660> one<00:06:09.780> on<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.080> left<00:06:10.290> is<00:06:10.500> the

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
incubators the one on the left is the

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.250 
incubators the one on the left is the
aquatic<00:06:11.400> pond<00:06:11.580> soil<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.870> one<00:06:13.020> on<00:06:13.050> the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
aquatic pond soil and the one on the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.300 
aquatic pond soil and the one on the
right<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:14.190> perlite<00:06:14.720> all<00:06:15.720> you<00:06:15.840> have<00:06:15.960> to<00:06:16.080> do

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
right is the perlite all you have to do

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.780 
right is the perlite all you have to do
stick<00:06:17.310> your<00:06:17.460> eggs<00:06:17.670> in<00:06:17.940> either<00:06:19.130> substance<00:06:20.130> you

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
stick your eggs in either substance you

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.240 
stick your eggs in either substance you
just<00:06:21.060> lay<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.420> eggs<00:06:21.600> right<00:06:21.870> on<00:06:21.930> top<00:06:22.260> of<00:06:22.290> the

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
just lay the eggs right on top of the

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.850 
just lay the eggs right on top of the
aquatic<00:06:23.610> pond<00:06:23.760> so<00:06:23.970> just<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.480> you<00:06:24.630> do<00:06:24.860> with

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
aquatic pond so just like you do with

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.670 
aquatic pond so just like you do with
the<00:06:25.920> perlite<00:06:27.800> just<00:06:28.800> put<00:06:28.980> a<00:06:29.010> lid<00:06:29.220> on<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.570> on

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
the perlite just put a lid on it on

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.320 
the perlite just put a lid on it on
either<00:06:31.680> one<00:06:31.920> and<00:06:32.190> you<00:06:32.700> just<00:06:32.880> set<00:06:33.180> them

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
either one and you just set them

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.150 
either one and you just set them
somewhere<00:06:34.080> where<00:06:34.140> you<00:06:34.470> can<00:06:34.650> keep<00:06:34.830> an<00:06:35.010> eye<00:06:35.130> on

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
somewhere where you can keep an eye on

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.950 
somewhere where you can keep an eye on
them<00:06:35.460> occasionally<00:06:37.100> just<00:06:38.100> try<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.430> put<00:06:38.700> them

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
them occasionally just try to put them

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.660 
them occasionally just try to put them
where<00:06:39.960> you<00:06:40.140> won't<00:06:40.320> be<00:06:40.470> bumping<00:06:40.980> into<00:06:41.130> them<00:06:41.490> or
