once<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> done<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
look for a location that is actually

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
look for a location that is actually
really<00:00:46.410> spacious<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:47.969> isn't<00:00:48.120> anything

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
really spacious if there isn't anything

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.760 
really spacious if there isn't anything
surrounding<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> area<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.010> buildings<00:00:50.550> or

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
surrounding the area like buildings or

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.049 
surrounding the area like buildings or
other<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.070> obstacles<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.760> mean<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.969> don't

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
other little obstacles I mean you don't

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
other little obstacles I mean you don't
really<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> city<00:00:55.140> because

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
really want to do it in the city because

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.410 
really want to do it in the city because
there's<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.399> many<00:00:56.489> buildings<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:57.270> there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
there's so many buildings around there

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880 
there's so many buildings around there
so<00:00:57.629> somewhere<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> beach

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so somewhere out in like the beach

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
so somewhere out in like the beach
section<00:00:59.309> would<00:00:59.430> probably<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> best

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
section would probably be the best

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
section would probably be the best
option<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.920> beach<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.340> probably<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
option to do the beach is probably the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
option to do the beach is probably the
best<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.840> also<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.379> body<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
best because you also need a body of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600 
best because you also need a body of
water<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.880> lake<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:07.170> ocean<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.490> beach

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
water a lake or an ocean and the beach

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
water a lake or an ocean and the beach
has<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> lot<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> flat<00:01:09.510> land<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.619> has

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
has a lot of flat land and it also has

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
has a lot of flat land and it also has
the<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.400> ocean<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.880> next<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.540> decided

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the the ocean right next to it I decided

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
the the ocean right next to it I decided
to<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.159> towards<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.540> rocky

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to go over here towards the little rocky

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
to go over here towards the little rocky
area<00:01:16.680> where<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> nice<00:01:18.600> little

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
area where there's like a nice little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
area where there's like a nice little
lake<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.040> even<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> main

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
lake and there's actually even the main

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
lake and there's actually even the main
road<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.470> important<00:01:22.920> for

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
road which is going to be important for

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
road which is going to be important for
when<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.520> sky<00:01:23.939> lift<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.470> that's<00:01:25.470> going

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
when I put my sky lift and that's going

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.469 
when I put my sky lift and that's going
to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.400> easy<00:01:26.610> spot<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to be really an easy spot to put it in

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
to be really an easy spot to put it in
so<00:01:27.689> after<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> find<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> place<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.009> want<00:01:29.189> to

so<00:01:41.159> put<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> trigger<00:01:41.790> location<00:01:42.299> wherever<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so put the trigger location wherever you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
so put the trigger location wherever you
can<00:01:42.960> after<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
can after that you want to go down and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
can after that you want to go down and
you<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.659> start<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.619> start<00:01:47.009> points<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you want to start up the start points so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
you want to start up the start points so
you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> satisfy<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:49.350> actual<00:01:50.869> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
you have to satisfy the actual the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
you have to satisfy the actual the
actual<00:01:52.170> requirements<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> order<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.369> test<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
actual requirements in order to test the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
actual requirements in order to test the
the<00:01:55.020> mid-level<00:01:55.500> tedium<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.130> doing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the mid-level tedium that you're doing

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
the mid-level tedium that you're doing
so<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> believe<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> takes<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.240> 8<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so I believe it takes about 8 of the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.889 
so I believe it takes about 8 of the
start<00:01:58.409> points<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.040> begin<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> test<00:01:59.729> mode<00:02:00.000> for

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
start points to begin a test mode for

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.370 
start points to begin a test mode for
for<00:02:01.110> each<00:02:01.259> side<00:02:01.560> t1<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> t2<00:02:03.110> after<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> have

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
for each side t1 and t2 after you have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.920 
for each side t1 and t2 after you have
done<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.969> where<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> vehicles

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
done that go down to where the vehicles

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.169 
done that go down to where the vehicles
are<00:02:07.020> located

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
are located

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.699 
are located
and<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.929> where<00:02:09.079> the<00:02:09.170> body<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.439> water

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
and this is where the body of water

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.069 
and this is where the body of water
comes<00:02:10.009> into<00:02:10.189> play<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.729> want<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.390> go<00:02:11.540> down<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
comes into play you want to go down to

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.369 
comes into play you want to go down to
the<00:02:12.439> category<00:02:13.370> switch<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.939> boats<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.450> then

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
the category switch it to boats and then

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.770 
the category switch it to boats and then
you<00:02:15.530> want<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.769> pick<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.189> marquee<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.629> is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
you want to pick the marquee now this is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.360 
you want to pick the marquee now this is
where<00:02:17.930> you're<00:02:18.079> going<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> need<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.829> body<00:02:19.159> of

where you're going to need the body of
water<00:02:19.579> since<00:02:20.209> here<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.439> see<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.799> that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
water since here you can see here that

water since here you can see here that
the<00:02:22.280> body<00:02:22.909> of<00:02:23.060> water<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.299> picked<00:02:23.569> when<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:23.989> red

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the body of water I picked when it's red

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.839 
the body of water I picked when it's red
I<00:02:24.230> can't<00:02:24.650> use<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.099> when<00:02:25.189> it's<00:02:25.340> white<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:25.579> can

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
I can't use it and when it's white I can

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.640 
I can't use it and when it's white I can
place<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:26.989> you're<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> do<00:02:27.439> is

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
place it so what you're going to do is

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.679 
place it so what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:27.829> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> place<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.700> marquee<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
you're going to place the marquee in the

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.679 
you're going to place the marquee in the
ocean<00:02:30.079> by<00:02:30.620> clicking<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.519> then<00:02:32.120> once<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.420> do

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
ocean by clicking a and then once you do

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.420 
ocean by clicking a and then once you do
that<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.079> click<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.409> once<00:02:33.709> again<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.099> pick<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that you click a once again to pick it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910 
that you click a once again to pick it
back<00:02:34.459> up<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.269> switch<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.590> actual

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
back up and it will switch to the actual

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.979 
back up and it will switch to the actual
sky<00:02:37.189> lift<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.269> got<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> find<00:02:38.689> a<00:02:38.810> place

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
sky lift so now you got to find a place

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.210 
sky lift so now you got to find a place
where<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.230> can<00:02:39.349> use<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.620> sky<00:02:39.799> lift<00:02:40.040> will

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
where you can use the sky lift will

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.220 
where you can use the sky lift will
actually<00:02:40.609> work<00:02:40.849> as<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.569> see<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:41.930> was

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
actually work as you can see here was

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.750 
actually work as you can see here was
only<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> little<00:02:42.769> bit<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.069> places<00:02:43.430> where<00:02:43.579> it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
only a little bit of places where it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
only a little bit of places where it
will<00:02:44.000> work<00:02:44.209> once<00:02:44.930> you've<00:02:45.049> found<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.319> place

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
will work once you've found the place

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.559 
will work once you've found the place
that<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.859> can<00:02:46.010> actually<00:02:46.190> fit<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.790> click<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
that you can actually fit it in click a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.780 
that you can actually fit it in click a
and<00:02:47.870> place<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.920> sky<00:02:49.129> lift<00:02:49.400> right<00:02:49.639> in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
and place this the sky lift right in

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.970 
and place this the sky lift right in
that<00:02:49.909> little<00:02:50.269> section<00:02:50.629> there<00:02:50.840> what<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.769> want

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that little section there what you want

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.530 
that little section there what you want
to<00:02:52.069> do<00:02:52.190> now<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.579> you<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:52.909> satisfy<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to do now is you want to satisfy the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.690 
to do now is you want to satisfy the
rest<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.139> requirements<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.099> actually

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
rest of the requirements to actually

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.149 
rest of the requirements to actually
start<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.209> test<00:02:56.510> which<00:02:57.200> pretty<00:02:57.680> much<00:02:57.829> all<00:02:58.040> you

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
start and test which pretty much all you

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.979 
start and test which pretty much all you
have<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:58.879> play<00:02:59.060> spawn<00:02:59.420> points<00:02:59.840> I

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
have to do is just play spawn points I

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.319 
have to do is just play spawn points I
believe<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.829> takes<00:03:01.069> about<00:03:01.250> thirty<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.939> spawn

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
believe it takes about thirty to spawn

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.179 
believe it takes about thirty to spawn
points<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.810> order<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.200> start<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> test<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
points in order to start the test and

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.039 
points in order to start the test and
you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.120> put<00:03:05.269> these<00:03:05.420> anywhere<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.870> doesn't

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
you can put these anywhere it doesn't

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.809 
you can put these anywhere it doesn't
matter<00:03:06.200> where<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.409> put<00:03:06.650> them<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.040> recommend

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
matter where you put them I recommend

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.729 
matter where you put them I recommend
you<00:03:08.000> don't<00:03:08.090> put<00:03:08.299> them<00:03:08.389> that<00:03:08.569> close<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.230> sky

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
you don't put them that close to the sky

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.020 
you don't put them that close to the sky
lift<00:03:09.920> because<00:03:10.220> then<00:03:10.370> everybody<00:03:10.609> is<00:03:10.819> going<00:03:10.849> to

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
lift because then everybody is going to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.059 
lift because then everybody is going to
be<00:03:11.349> surrounding<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.470> area<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.889> it's<00:03:13.010> going

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
click test you will see that the sky

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.960 
click test you will see that the sky
lift<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.049> actually<00:03:30.650> located<00:03:30.859> in<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.549> map<00:03:31.730> that

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
lift is actually located in the map that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.939 
lift is actually located in the map that
you're<00:03:32.419> going<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.629> be<00:03:32.720> testing<00:03:33.109> what<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.680> did

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
you're going to be testing what I did

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.849 
you're going to be testing what I did
like<00:03:34.099> I<00:03:34.250> said<00:03:34.489> was<00:03:34.639> I<00:03:34.669> held<00:03:35.000> down<00:03:35.269> on<00:03:35.569> my<00:03:35.930> on<00:03:36.799> my

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
like I said was I held down on my on my

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.699 
like I said was I held down on my on my
D<00:03:37.519> pad<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.209> actually<00:03:38.479> turned<00:03:39.319> on<00:03:39.500> my

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
D pad and I actually turned on my

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.289 
D pad and I actually turned on my
invincibility<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> wouldn't<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.150> able<00:03:41.209> to

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
invincibility so I wouldn't be able to

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.659 
invincibility so I wouldn't be able to
be<00:03:41.419> shot<00:03:41.659> ran<00:03:42.409> right<00:03:42.650> past<00:03:42.680> these<00:03:43.129> guys<00:03:43.310> and

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
be shot ran right past these guys and

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.059 
be shot ran right past these guys and
you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.209> actually<00:03:44.510> now<00:03:44.659> hop<00:03:44.959> into<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.650> sky

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
you can actually now hop into the sky

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.949 
you can actually now hop into the sky
lift<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.150> regular<00:03:47.329> vehicle<00:03:47.659> you<00:03:47.870> hit
