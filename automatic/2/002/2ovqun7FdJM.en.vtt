00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
passer you know most of the passes that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I did just reached over the top through

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
I did just reached over the top through
ball<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.250> normal<00:02:47.550> passes<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.960> bad

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
ball or just normal passes and the bad

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.080 
ball or just normal passes and the bad
thing<00:02:49.410> guys<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.220> he's<00:02:50.370> not<00:02:50.520> really<00:02:50.730> fast

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
thing guys is that he's not really fast

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.570 
thing guys is that he's not really fast
he<00:02:51.240> hasn't<00:02:51.720> got<00:02:51.840> 90<00:02:52.140> paces<00:02:52.560> more<00:02:52.770> like<00:02:52.950> at<00:02:53.070> 85

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
he hasn't got 90 paces more like at 85

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.120 
he hasn't got 90 paces more like at 85
the<00:02:54.060> reason<00:02:54.450> why<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.990> he<00:02:55.290> focuses<00:02:55.890> more

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the reason why is that he focuses more

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.910 
the reason why is that he focuses more
on<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.430> ball<00:02:56.580> control<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:58.290> why<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.530> know

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
on the ball control that's why you know
