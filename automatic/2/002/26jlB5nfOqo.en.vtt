00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
welcome to learn biology and today we'll

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.079 
welcome to learn biology and today we'll
be<00:00:03.060> discussing<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.870> properties<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.500> water

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
be discussing the properties of water

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.450 
be discussing the properties of water
water<00:00:06.089> surrounds<00:00:06.990> 3/4<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.740> our<00:00:07.859> whole<00:00:08.130> planet

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
water surrounds 3/4 of our whole planet

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.570 
water surrounds 3/4 of our whole planet
and<00:00:08.790> simply<00:00:09.719> nothing<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.980> planet<00:00:11.429> can

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and simply nothing on this planet can

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.999 
and simply nothing on this planet can
live<00:00:11.849> without<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.660> differentiates<00:00:13.469> from

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
live without it it differentiates from

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
live without it it differentiates from
any<00:00:14.400> other<00:00:14.759> known<00:00:15.120> compound<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.049> chemistry

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
any other known compound in chemistry

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.380 
any other known compound in chemistry
and<00:00:16.890> has<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.029> many<00:00:18.390> properties<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.920> is

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
and has so many properties that it is

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.590 
and has so many properties that it is
unbelievable

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
unbelievable

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.779 
unbelievable
the<00:00:22.320> first<00:00:22.650> thing<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.100> need<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.609> about

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the first thing we need to know about

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.170 
the first thing we need to know about
water<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.410> held<00:00:26.279> together<00:00:26.580> by

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
water is that it is held together by

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200 
water is that it is held together by
hydrogen<00:00:27.500> bonds<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.550> means<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
hydrogen bonds and what this means is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.910 
hydrogen bonds and what this means is
that<00:00:31.489> when<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.180> water<00:00:33.450> molecule

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
that when we have a water molecule

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.750 
that when we have a water molecule
here's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> small<00:00:35.430> diagram<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.660> has<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.760> big

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
here's a small diagram it has a big

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.580 
here's a small diagram it has a big
oxygen<00:00:40.190> which<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> negatively<00:00:41.850> charged<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.450 

we<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:47.420> two<00:00:48.420> hydrogen's<00:00:49.129> connected<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we have two hydrogen's connected to this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.779 
we have two hydrogen's connected to this
making<00:00:51.090> h2o<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.620> are<00:00:52.860> both<00:00:53.129> positively

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
making h2o which are both positively

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:03.410 
making h2o which are both positively
charged<00:00:57.469> they<00:00:58.469> connect<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.879> another<00:01:02.420> water

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
charged they connect to another water

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
charged they connect to another water
molecule<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.210> happens<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> oxygen

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
molecule so what happens is the oxygen

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
molecule so what happens is the oxygen
is<00:01:07.650> attracted<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> hydrogen<00:01:10.880> call<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is attracted to the hydrogen call that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
is attracted to the hydrogen call that
positive<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> oxygen<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.330> still<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
positive and the oxygen is still on the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.039 
positive and the oxygen is still on the
other<00:01:20.549> side

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.830 

so<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.560> bond<00:01:31.159> in<00:01:31.610> between<00:01:32.290> right<00:01:33.290> there<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.040> a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
so the bond in between right there is a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.100 
so the bond in between right there is a
hydrogen<00:01:35.840> bond<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.299> this<00:01:38.299> is<00:01:38.509> possible

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
hydrogen bond and this is possible

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.969 
hydrogen bond and this is possible
because<00:01:39.500> water<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.670> polar<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.960> what<00:01:42.799> this

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
because water is polar and what this

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.760 
because water is polar and what this
means<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:44.210> water<00:01:44.780> molecule<00:01:45.140> is

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
means is that a water molecule is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.550 
means is that a water molecule is
slightly<00:01:46.280> charged<00:01:46.940> see<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.930> positive<00:01:48.440> is

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
slightly charged see the positive is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.320 
slightly charged see the positive is
attracted<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.280> negative<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.299> other

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
attracted to the negative and the other

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.180 
attracted to the negative and the other
positive<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.200> still<00:01:51.440> attracted<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
positive is still attracted to the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.969 
positive is still attracted to the
negative<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.600> side<00:01:53.930> creates<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.740> negative

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
negative so this side creates a negative

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.399 
negative so this side creates a negative
slight<00:01:55.759> negative<00:01:56.000> charge<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.930> cycler

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
slight negative charge that this cycler

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.889 
slight negative charge that this cycler
is<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.530> slight<00:01:57.830> positive<00:01:58.100> charge<00:01:58.720> allowing<00:01:59.720> it

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
is a slight positive charge allowing it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.649 
is a slight positive charge allowing it
to<00:02:00.080> connect<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.979> other<00:02:01.190> water<00:02:01.610> molecules<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
to connect to other water molecules and

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.440 
to connect to other water molecules and
this<00:02:03.470> leads<00:02:03.740> us<00:02:03.950> right<00:02:04.069> on<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.149> first

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
this leads us right on to the first

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.710 
this leads us right on to the first
property<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:06.409> are<00:02:06.440> going<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:07.360> describe<00:02:08.360> here

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
property we are going to describe here

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.340 
property we are going to describe here
which<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:10.420> cohesion<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:13.000> cohesion<00:02:14.350> cohesion

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
which is cohesion so cohesion cohesion

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
which is cohesion so cohesion cohesion
by<00:02:16.100> definition<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:18.680> attraction

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
by definition is just an attraction

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.690 
by definition is just an attraction
between<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:20.420> substances<00:02:21.410> which<00:02:21.830> help<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
between like substances which help the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.070 
between like substances which help the
substance<00:02:23.420> hold<00:02:24.290> together<00:02:25.000> water<00:02:26.000> does<00:02:26.780> this

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
substance hold together water does this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.160 
substance hold together water does this
because<00:02:27.950> as<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.370> mentioned<00:02:29.060> earlier<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
because as I mentioned earlier it is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.660 
because as I mentioned earlier it is
polar<00:02:30.850> what<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:31.970> does<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.670> individual

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
polar what it does is the individual

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.250 
polar what it does is the individual
water<00:02:34.940> molecules<00:02:35.920> stick<00:02:36.920> together<00:02:37.150> creating

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
water molecules stick together creating

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.180 
water molecules stick together creating

cohesion<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.680> reason<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:02.049> causes

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
cohesion is the reason that causes

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.099 
cohesion is the reason that causes
surface<00:03:03.859> tension<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.489> surface<00:03:05.390> tension<00:03:05.720> is

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
surface tension and surface tension is

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.890 
surface tension and surface tension is
the<00:03:06.560> reason<00:03:07.010> why<00:03:07.220> water<00:03:08.000> doesn't<00:03:08.510> move<00:03:08.660> as

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
the reason why water doesn't move as

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.330 
the reason why water doesn't move as
individual<00:03:09.680> molecules<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.549> moves<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.510> well<00:03:11.989> as

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
individual molecules it moves as well as

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.449 
individual molecules it moves as well as
several<00:03:13.340> water<00:03:13.640> molecules<00:03:14.329> at<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> time<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
several water molecules at a time so the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.729 
several water molecules at a time so the
next<00:03:16.730> property<00:03:16.970> we'll<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.570> discussing<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.470> is

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
next property we'll be discussing is is

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.170 
next property we'll be discussing is is
going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.510> addition<00:03:21.130> now<00:03:22.130> addition<00:03:23.000> is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
going to be addition now addition is

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.949 
going to be addition now addition is
described<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.970> attraction<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.090> water<00:03:26.420> to

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
described as attraction of water to

described as attraction of water to
other<00:03:27.200> molecules<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:29.150> example<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:30.290> see<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
other molecules in this example we see a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.400 
other molecules in this example we see a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.590 
glass with the straw in it simple enough
something<00:03:33.829> we<00:03:33.950> see<00:03:34.130> every<00:03:34.370> day<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.060> what<00:03:35.329> goes

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
something we see every day but what goes

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.449 
something we see every day but what goes
on<00:03:35.630> in<00:03:36.260> here<00:03:36.799> is<00:03:36.949> the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
on in here is the

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.319 
on in here is the
even<00:03:37.730> before<00:03:37.909> we<00:03:38.480> drink<00:03:39.019> out<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.500> straw

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
even before we drink out of the straw

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.890 
even before we drink out of the straw
tiny<00:03:41.500> water<00:03:42.500> molecules<00:03:43.450> attract<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
tiny water molecules attract to the

tiny water molecules attract to the
inside<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.859> straw<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.489> slowly<00:03:47.379> go<00:03:48.379> up<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:49.219 
inside of the straw and slowly go up the

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.449 
inside of the straw and slowly go up the
straw<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:50.200> actually<00:03:51.200> make<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.010> easier<00:03:52.219> for

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
straw and actually make it easier for

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.890 
straw and actually make it easier for
you<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.909> drink<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.480> water

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
you to drink the water

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.369 
you to drink the water
so<00:03:54.319> describing<00:03:55.069> this<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:56.359> image<00:03:56.810> we<00:03:57.230> would

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
so describing this in the image we would

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.470 
so describing this in the image we would
see<00:03:59.349> we<00:04:00.349> would<00:04:00.469> see<00:04:00.739> tiny<00:04:01.310> little<00:04:01.730> beads<00:04:02.120> in

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
see we would see tiny little beads in

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.399 
see we would see tiny little beads in
here<00:04:03.879> already<00:04:04.879> attracting<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.930> each<00:04:06.139> other

through the through cohesion and what

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.369 
through the through cohesion and what
they<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:09.829> is<00:04:10.040> attract<00:04:10.669> to<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.000> plastic<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:11.780> go

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
they do is attract to the plastic and go

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.990 
they do is attract to the plastic and go
up<00:04:12.650> what<00:04:13.549> they<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.030> actually<00:04:14.209> they<00:04:14.959> roll<00:04:15.409> up

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
up what they do is actually they roll up

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.550 
up what they do is actually they roll up
this<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.359> keep<00:04:17.630> rolling<00:04:18.289> up<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:19.039> as<00:04:20.500> much<00:04:21.500> as

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
this just keep rolling up and as much as

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.089 
this just keep rolling up and as much as

property of water high specific heat so

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.300 
property of water high specific heat so
what<00:04:47.090> high<00:04:47.300> specific<00:04:47.900> heat<00:04:47.930> does<00:04:48.409> is<00:04:48.770> prevents

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
what high specific heat does is prevents

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.500 
what high specific heat does is prevents
the<00:04:49.460> water<00:04:49.490> from<00:04:49.940> rapidly<00:04:50.840> heating<00:04:51.380> up<00:04:51.650> now

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
the water from rapidly heating up now

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.080 
the water from rapidly heating up now
this<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.889> extremely<00:04:54.889> important<00:04:55.729> because

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
this is extremely important because

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.170 
this is extremely important because
without<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.659> aquatic<00:04:57.500> animals<00:04:58.130> would<00:04:58.610> not<00:04:58.849> be

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
specific heat is that it is this exact

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.340 
specific heat is that it is this exact
definition<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:42.540> amount<00:05:43.540> of<00:05:43.810> heat<00:05:44.110> energy

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
definition is amount of heat energy

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.550 
definition is amount of heat energy
needed<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.490> increase<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:46.390> temperature<00:05:46.600> of

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
needed to increase the temperature of

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.820 
needed to increase the temperature of
one<00:05:48.520> gram<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.360> substance<00:05:49.390> by<00:05:50.290> one<00:05:50.590> degree

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
one gram of a substance by one degree

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.560 
one gram of a substance by one degree
the<00:05:51.700> specific<00:05:52.330> heat<00:05:52.570> of<00:05:52.600> water<00:05:52.960> is<00:05:54.570> 4.184

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
the specific heat of water is 4.184

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:07.730 
the specific heat of water is 4.184
joules<00:05:57.150> per<00:06:00.120> one<00:06:01.120> gram<00:06:02.880> times<00:06:04.890> degree<00:06:06.570> one

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
joules per one gram times degree one

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:14.450 
joules per one gram times degree one
Celsius<00:06:09.660> so<00:06:10.660> this<00:06:11.290> says<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.130> takes<00:06:12.750> 4.184

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460
