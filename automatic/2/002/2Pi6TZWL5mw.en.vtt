00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
the dust he has everything in this
entire<00:02:57.329> warehouse<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:58.079> filled<00:02:58.650> with<00:02:58.859> dust

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
entire warehouse is filled with dust

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.740 
entire warehouse is filled with dust
he<00:02:59.430> doesn't<00:02:59.730> need<00:02:59.849> pretty<00:03:00.150> much<00:03:00.329> any<00:03:00.569> more

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
he doesn't need pretty much any more

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.300 
he doesn't need pretty much any more
dust<00:03:01.079> anymore<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.010> they're<00:03:02.129> gonna<00:03:02.189> be

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
dust anymore and so they're gonna be

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.649 
dust anymore and so they're gonna be
moving<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.760> phase<00:03:03.090> two

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
moving to phase two

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.449 
moving to phase two
so<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.260> don't<00:03:04.439> technically<00:03:04.829> know<00:03:05.069> what<00:03:05.340> this

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
so we don't technically know what this

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.610 
so we don't technically know what this
phase<00:03:05.790> two<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.299> but<00:03:06.780> definitely<00:03:07.200> majority<00:03:07.590> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
phase two is but definitely majority I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.229 
phase two is but definitely majority I
think<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.980> season<00:03:08.280> two<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:08.669> can<00:03:08.849> aarti<00:03:09.090> gas

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
think of season two as we can aarti gas

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.509 
think of season two as we can aarti gas
is<00:03:09.389> gonna<00:03:09.569> be<00:03:09.689> this<00:03:09.840> phase<00:03:10.079> two<00:03:10.439> but<00:03:11.189> there's

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
is gonna be this phase two but there's

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.670 
is gonna be this phase two but there's
one<00:03:11.849> scene<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.480> episode<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.530> to
