 good morning friends and friends from 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.269
 our channel we continue with the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.709
 Cucumber information 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.480
 I have a video of properties and 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.150
 benefits benefits and properties of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 cucumber but apart from that we can do 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 many more things with the cucumber says that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.789
 to clean in leather shoes 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.600
 of skin 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.439
 rub 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.750
 some cucumber slices steal the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.670
 our salads a few slices of 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.969
 cucumber 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 scrub them over shoes and 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.300
 cucumber chemists your friendship 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.129
 will provide a quick shine and 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.880
 durable that even repels water 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:59.720
 let's make a pair of leather ankle boots 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.790
 says that you have to face the cucumber 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.790
 and this both the cucumber 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.310
 and says that it replaces the brightness that 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.310
 we achieve with the bitumen 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 I'm doing it live 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.670
 and if you want more 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.630
 makes the water slide 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 have 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 of the moment 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.880
 I have cleaned 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.359
 with the tips 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.350
 I will do the same on the sides or I have 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.079
 all right 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.219
 there are the slices of cucumber that I've 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.219
 gone through the booties 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.880
 it is true that as it is wet 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.880
 has collected the dust he has had 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.260
 I'm going to let it dry 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.000
 there are parts that have been shiny but 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.000
 I'll let it dry to check 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.040
 in the minute dry 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.390
 and indeed 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.860
 has dried 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.570
 I have not left it like a patent leather but 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 it has given a shine as if it had 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.200
 brushed 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.969
 it is not badly checked 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.250
 6 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.930
 good friends and friends friends 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.469
 use cucumber 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.740
 If we have it, try some slices of 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.410
 the salads 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.550
 and to pass it through our shoes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.550
 leather or skin
