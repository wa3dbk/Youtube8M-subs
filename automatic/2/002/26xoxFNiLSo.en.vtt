00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
time and feel is necessary to review the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.709 
time and feel is necessary to review the
episode<00:00:11.040> specifically<00:00:11.460> but<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.330> episode

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
episode specifically but this episode

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.799 
episode specifically but this episode
guys<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.070> favorite<00:00:14.490> episode<00:00:14.549> by<00:00:15.120> far<00:00:15.480> I'm

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
guys was my favorite episode by far I'm

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
guys was my favorite episode by far I'm
actually<00:00:16.379> wasn't<00:00:16.710> too<00:00:16.830> much<00:00:17.190> better<00:00:17.460> than<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
actually wasn't too much better than the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210 
actually wasn't too much better than the
first<00:00:17.940> episode<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.680> favorite

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
first episode but it was my favorite

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340 
first episode but it was my favorite
episode<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> think<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.480> may<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.080> an

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
episode and I think that this may be an

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.109 
episode and I think that this may be an
episode<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.830> were<00:00:22.980> spoiled<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> review<00:00:23.880> for

here<00:01:28.670> Vegeta<00:01:29.670> gets<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.540> depth

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
here Vegeta gets a little bit more depth

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.530 
here Vegeta gets a little bit more depth
in<00:01:31.110> his<00:01:31.320> backstory<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.189> well<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> um<00:01:33.470> vegeta's

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
in his backstory as well and um vegeta's

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.910 
in his backstory as well and um vegeta's
actions<00:01:36.540> towards<00:01:36.900> beer<00:01:37.110> sins<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.619> very

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
actions towards beer sins are very

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319 
actions towards beer sins are very
similar<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> battle<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> gods<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.119> they're

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
similar to battle of gods but they're

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.300 
similar to battle of gods but they're
almost<00:01:39.479> amplified<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> way<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:41.070> we

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
almost amplified in a way because we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
almost amplified in a way because we
know<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> vegeta<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.119> obviously<00:01:42.509> afraid<00:01:42.899> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
know that vegeta was obviously afraid of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
know that vegeta was obviously afraid of
beers<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.470> battle<00:01:43.680> gods<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
beers and battle gods but it really is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
beers and battle gods but it really is
further<00:01:45.240> um<00:01:45.920> capitalized<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
load of beers and vegeta that's kind of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.479 
load of beers and vegeta that's kind of
main<00:03:40.050> focus<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.560> those<00:03:40.709> two<00:03:40.920> characters<00:03:41.130> in

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
this episode now the animation is

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800 
this episode now the animation is
improved<00:03:44.090> definitely<00:03:45.090> from<00:03:45.269> last<00:03:45.480> week<00:03:45.630> but

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
improved definitely from last week but

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.680 
improved definitely from last week but
there<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.140> some<00:03:46.820> definitely<00:03:47.820> bad<00:03:48.030> shots<00:03:48.480> that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
there are some definitely bad shots that

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.850 
there are some definitely bad shots that
i'll<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.840> showing<00:03:49.140> here<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.530> screen<00:03:49.739> you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
i'll be showing here on the screen you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.620 
i'll be showing here on the screen you
see<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.340> there<00:03:50.430> are<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.820> shots<00:03:51.090> are<00:03:51.360> bad

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
see that there are some shots are bad

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.780 
see that there are some shots are bad
but<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.170> most<00:03:52.380> part<00:03:52.530> guys<00:03:52.860> they're

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
but for the most part guys they're

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.000 
but for the most part guys they're
usually<00:03:54.060> reserved<00:03:54.660> for<00:03:54.810> far<00:03:55.260> away<00:03:55.530> shots

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
usually reserved for far away shots

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.460 
usually reserved for far away shots
which<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.030> generally<00:03:57.510> what<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.050> would<00:03:58.200> see<00:03:58.410> in

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
which is generally what you would see in

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.410 
which is generally what you would see in
a<00:03:58.620> regular<00:03:59.100> anime<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.550> it's<00:03:59.820> nothing<00:04:00.209> too

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
a regular anime so it's nothing too

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.040 
a regular anime so it's nothing too
scary<00:04:00.989> for<00:04:01.260> us<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.660> close-up<00:04:03.660> shots<00:04:03.900> are

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
scary for us the the close-up shots are

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.449 
scary for us the the close-up shots are
generally<00:04:04.530> very<00:04:04.560> good<00:04:04.950> there<00:04:05.100> are<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> couple

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
generally very good there are a couple

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.220 
generally very good there are a couple
of<00:04:05.670> missteps<00:04:06.090> here<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.480> there<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.959> mid-range

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
of missteps here and there for mid-range

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.740 
of missteps here and there for mid-range
in<00:04:07.680> closer<00:04:07.950> shots<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.970> for<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.209> most<00:04:09.390> part<00:04:09.480> is

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
in closer shots but for the most part is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.140 
in closer shots but for the most part is
reserved<00:04:10.110> for<00:04:10.230> far<00:04:10.560> away<00:04:10.709> shots<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.910> can

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
reserved for far away shots so you can

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.670 
reserved for far away shots so you can
expect<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:12.900> are<00:04:13.080> going<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.320> have<00:04:13.500> an

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
expect that we are going to have an

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.530 
expect that we are going to have an
animation<00:04:14.130> quirks<00:04:14.760> here<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:15.300> it's

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
animation quirks here and there but it's

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.270 
animation quirks here and there but it's
not<00:04:15.720> going<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.989> be<00:04:16.109> at<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.290> level<00:04:16.440> episode<00:04:17.010> 5

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
not going to be at the level episode 5

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
not going to be at the level episode 5
