and<00:01:40.020> he's<00:01:40.500> nowhere<00:01:40.710> near<00:01:40.860> parallel<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and he's nowhere near parallel so if I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
and he's nowhere near parallel so if I
were<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:42.630> him<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.860> were<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
were to back him down and you were to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
were to back him down and you were to

see that as he gets a golf club to the
top<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.259> close<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> parallel<00:01:49.829> at

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
top it's not very close to parallel at

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
top it's not very close to parallel at
all<00:01:50.340> he's<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.329> quite<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.780> shorter

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
all he's actually quite a bit shorter

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
all he's actually quite a bit shorter
parallel<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> his<00:01:53.430> top<00:01:53.640> part<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> his

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
parallel this is his top part of his

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.429 
parallel this is his top part of his
golf<00:01:54.210> swing<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.570> shot<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.200> over

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
golf swing in this shot was just over

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.700 
golf swing in this shot was just over
200<00:01:55.799> yards<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.719> he's<00:01:57.719> obviously<00:01:58.200> known<00:01:58.469> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
200 yards and he's obviously known as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
200 yards and he's obviously known as
one<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> longer<00:01:59.700> players<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.360> tour

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
one of the longer players out on tour

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
one of the longer players out on tour
and<00:02:00.689> he's<00:02:01.170> still<00:02:01.469> able<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> generate<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> lot<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and he's still able to generate a lot of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.100 
and he's still able to generate a lot of
speed<00:02:02.549> even<00:02:03.210> without<00:02:03.450> getting<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> club<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
speed even without getting the club to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.109 
speed even without getting the club to
parallel<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.219> let's<00:02:05.399> go<00:02:05.460> ahead<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.670> focus<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
parallel so let's go ahead and focus on

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.910 
parallel so let's go ahead and focus on
some<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> areas<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:06.990> Jason<00:02:07.560> does<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
well to pack so much club head speed and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110 
well to pack so much club head speed and
power<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.619> his<00:02:10.739> golf<00:02:10.920> swing<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.879> want

he's got full extension of both arms

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.399 
he's got full extension of both arms
into<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.360> completed<00:02:27.780> part<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> take<00:02:28.230> away

a very wide sort of swing shape now we
do<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> great<00:02:50.579> video<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:50.940> website

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
do have a great video on the website

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.210 
do have a great video on the website
called<00:02:51.480> wide<00:02:51.810> narrow<00:02:52.109> wide<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.829> that's<00:02:53.040> how

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
called wide narrow wide and that's how

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.160 
called wide narrow wide and that's how
we're<00:02:53.430> gonna<00:02:53.519> take<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.239> golf<00:02:54.390> club<00:02:54.599> wide<00:02:54.870> in

and then we're gonna get wide back

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.080 
and then we're gonna get wide back
through<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.250> impact<00:02:59.640> or<00:02:59.819> through<00:03:00.000> the

hitting area to deliver all that speed

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.630 
hitting area to deliver all that speed
now<00:03:03.090> there's<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.599> area<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.200> Jason<00:03:04.650> does<00:03:05.220> so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

you to pay very close attention to what

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.610 
you to pay very close attention to what
his<00:03:12.000> left<00:03:12.299> leg<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.690> doing<00:03:12.930> from<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> top<00:03:13.379> part

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
his left leg is doing from the top part

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.800 
his left leg is doing from the top part
of<00:03:13.650> his<00:03:13.739> golf<00:03:14.010> swing<00:03:14.159> down<00:03:14.489> you're<00:03:15.359> gonna<00:03:15.480> see

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
of his golf swing down you're gonna see

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.659 
of his golf swing down you're gonna see
that<00:03:16.019> his<00:03:16.200> left<00:03:16.560> leg<00:03:16.889> is<00:03:17.220> starting<00:03:17.489> to

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
that his left leg is starting to

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.750 
that his left leg is starting to
externally<00:03:18.419> rotate<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.109> what<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.620> left<00:03:20.160> leg

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
externally rotate and what that left leg

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.819 
externally rotate and what that left leg
external<00:03:21.299> rotation<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.930> allowing<00:03:22.380> him<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> do

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
external rotation is allowing him to do

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.819 
external rotation is allowing him to do
is<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.730> seated<00:03:24.269> into<00:03:24.480> his<00:03:24.599> left<00:03:24.840> side<00:03:25.079> we've

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
is get seated into his left side we've

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.440 
is get seated into his left side we've
got<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:26.010> great<00:03:26.519> video<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.060> downswing

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
got a great video on the downswing

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.909 
got a great video on the downswing
section<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:27.989> website<00:03:28.139> called<00:03:28.560> sitting

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
section of the website called sitting

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.050 
section of the website called sitting
into<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.160> left<00:03:29.310> side<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:29.760> all

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
into the left side and that's all

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.150 
into the left side and that's all
explained<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.780> video<00:03:30.989> but<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.889> left

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
explained in that video but that left

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.099 
explained in that video but that left
leg<00:03:32.430> external<00:03:33.030> rotation<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.629> getting<00:03:33.930> him

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
leg external rotation is getting him

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.199 
leg external rotation is getting him
into<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.379> position<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.919> where<00:03:35.040> he's<00:03:35.310> stacking

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
into a position to where he's stacking

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.030 
into a position to where he's stacking
up<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.690> left<00:03:36.930> side<00:03:37.109> or<00:03:37.290> loading<00:03:37.769> into<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
up this left side or loading into the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.430 
up this left side or loading into the
left<00:03:38.220> side<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.579> he<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:38.849> start<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.419> take<00:03:40.200> that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
left side so he can start to take that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.319 
left side so he can start to take that
power<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:41.040> stored<00:03:41.489> power<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.150> body

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
power that stored power out of the body

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.789 
power that stored power out of the body
and<00:03:42.599> start<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> move<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.260> up<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.470> kinetic

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
and start to move it up the kinetic

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.250 
and start to move it up the kinetic
chain<00:03:43.879> now<00:03:44.879> as<00:03:45.120> he's<00:03:45.299> starting<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.780> or<00:03:46.139> he's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
chain now as he's starting to or he's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.900 
chain now as he's starting to or he's
fully<00:03:46.560> shifted<00:03:47.099> into<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.370> left<00:03:47.579> side<00:03:47.730> you're

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
fully shifted into that left side you're

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.640 
fully shifted into that left side you're
gonna<00:03:48.000> see<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> lot<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.599> rotation<00:03:48.810> coming<00:03:49.500> from

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
gonna see a lot of rotation coming from

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.890 
gonna see a lot of rotation coming from
the<00:03:49.799> left<00:03:50.010> obliques<00:03:50.489> okay<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.389> can<00:03:51.569> see<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the left obliques okay you can see the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.569 
the left obliques okay you can see the
left<00:03:52.049> obliques<00:03:52.500> are<00:03:52.680> really<00:03:53.160> starting<00:03:53.459> to

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
left obliques are really starting to

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.939 
left obliques are really starting to
unwind<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.780> what<00:03:55.260> they're<00:03:55.410> doing<00:03:55.769> are

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
unwind here and what they're doing are

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.710 
unwind here and what they're doing are
the<00:03:56.310> responsibility<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.449> they're<00:03:57.599> gonna

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the responsibility is is they're gonna

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.420 
the responsibility is is they're gonna
be<00:03:57.930> pulling<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.410> left<00:03:58.590> hip<00:03:58.709> away<00:03:59.129> from<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
be pulling the left hip away from the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.349 
be pulling the left hip away from the
target<00:03:59.669> so<00:04:00.480> from<00:04:01.199> this<00:04:01.349> position<00:04:01.760> into<00:04:02.760> almost

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
target so from this position into almost

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.509 
target so from this position into almost
the<00:04:03.750> hitting<00:04:03.959> area<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.709> appears<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.400> his

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the hitting area it appears that his

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.339 
the hitting area it appears that his
arms<00:04:05.910> are<00:04:06.030> doing<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.299> lot<00:04:06.449> of<00:04:06.480> work<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.230> is

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
arms are doing a lot of work and that is

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.379 
arms are doing a lot of work and that is
not<00:04:07.530> true<00:04:07.739> at<00:04:07.859> all<00:04:07.949> a<00:04:08.250> lot<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.000> arm

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
not true at all a lot of the arm

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.210 
not true at all a lot of the arm
movements<00:04:09.900> are<00:04:10.019> created<00:04:10.379> from<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> rotation

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
movements are created from the rotation

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.369 
movements are created from the rotation
of<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.370> body<00:04:11.579> so<00:04:12.389> he's<00:04:12.569> taking<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.139> power

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
of the body so he's taking that power

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.559 
of the body so he's taking that power
he's<00:04:14.040> shifting<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:14.940> I'm<00:04:15.209> sorry<00:04:15.359> he's

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
he's shifting it or I'm sorry he's

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.150 
he's shifting it or I'm sorry he's
taking<00:04:15.840> his<00:04:15.930> weight<00:04:16.199> he's<00:04:16.410> shifting<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.949> into

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
taking his weight he's shifting it into

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.259 
taking his weight he's shifting it into
the<00:04:17.250> left<00:04:17.400> side<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.880> external

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
the left side with that external

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.240 
the left side with that external
rotation<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.840> left<00:04:19.049> leg<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.500> he's

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
rotation of the left leg and he's

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.979 
rotation of the left leg and he's
driving<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.000> heel<00:04:21.209> into<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.510> ground<00:04:21.719> and<00:04:21.900> at

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
driving that heel into the ground and at

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.330 
driving that heel into the ground and at
the<00:04:22.079> same<00:04:22.260> time<00:04:22.530> he's<00:04:22.800> using<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.159> left

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the same time he's using the left

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.860 
the same time he's using the left
obliques<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.820> start<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.270> pull

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
obliques to start to pull

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.659 
obliques to start to pull
and<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.440> pulling<00:04:25.800> movement<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.250> creating

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
and that pulling movement is creating

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.460 
and that pulling movement is creating
rotation<00:04:27.510> it's<00:04:27.630> pulling<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.990> hip<00:04:28.080> away<00:04:28.290> from

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
rotation it's pulling the hip away from

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.050 
rotation it's pulling the hip away from
the<00:04:28.560> target<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:28.919> it's<00:04:29.070> also<00:04:29.370> rotating<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
the target and it's also rotating the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.480 
the target and it's also rotating the
torso<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.690> that's<00:04:31.500> getting<00:04:31.860> his<00:04:31.979> arms<00:04:32.310> into

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
torso and that's getting his arms into

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.939 
torso and that's getting his arms into
the<00:04:32.639> position<00:04:33.000> where<00:04:33.030> he<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.479> start<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:34.110> take

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
the position where he can start to take

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.530 
the position where he can start to take
the<00:04:35.130> power<00:04:35.310> out<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.699> kinetic<00:04:36.030> chain<00:04:36.060> and

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
the power out of the kinetic chain and

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.450 
the power out of the kinetic chain and
turn<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.050> into<00:04:37.199> club<00:04:37.620> head<00:04:37.740> speed<00:04:37.770> into<00:04:38.370> the

turn it into club head speed into the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.700 
turn it into club head speed into the
hitting<00:04:38.610> area<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.660> here<00:04:40.139> we<00:04:40.229> are<00:04:40.260> right<00:04:40.410> about

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
hitting area so here we are right about

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.530 
hitting area so here we are right about
the<00:04:40.949> lag<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.400> release<00:04:41.639> area<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.389> see

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
the lag and release area you can see

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.760 
the lag and release area you can see
that<00:04:42.660> he's<00:04:42.750> got<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.930> fair<00:04:43.169> amount<00:04:43.199> of<00:04:43.410> lag<00:04:43.560> here

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
that he's got a fair amount of lag here

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.590 
that he's got a fair amount of lag here
not<00:04:44.010> an<00:04:44.220> exorbitant<00:04:44.669> amount<00:04:44.910> like<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.270> lot<00:04:45.479> of

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
not an exorbitant amount like a lot of

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.090 
not an exorbitant amount like a lot of
players<00:04:45.810> out<00:04:46.050> there<00:04:46.229> try<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.590> achieve<00:04:46.740> where

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
players out there try to achieve where

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.790 
players out there try to achieve where
they<00:04:47.220> get<00:04:47.370> Sergio<00:04:48.030> style<00:04:48.389> lag<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:49.440> he's<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.710> a

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
they get Sergio style lag but he's in a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.230 
they get Sergio style lag but he's in a
position<00:04:50.040> where<00:04:50.310> he<00:04:50.400> can<00:04:50.550> start<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.030> pull<00:04:51.210> that

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
position where he can start to pull that

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240 
position where he can start to pull that
power<00:04:51.600> out<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.050> transfer<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.680> speed<00:04:53.010> and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
power out and transfer it in speed and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.280 
power out and transfer it in speed and
this<00:04:53.729> is<00:04:53.910> virtually<00:04:54.389> where<00:04:54.600> he<00:04:54.750> starts<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.169> go

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
this is virtually where he starts to go

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.529 
this is virtually where he starts to go
in<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.470> release<00:04:55.740> mode<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.120> see<00:04:57.389> that

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
in to release mode and you can see that

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.170 
in to release mode and you can see that
he<00:04:57.660> keeps<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.590> width<00:04:59.039> through<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.880> finish

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
he keeps that width through the finish

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.960 
he keeps that width through the finish
so<00:05:00.960> now<00:05:01.169> he's<00:05:01.410> delivered<00:05:01.919> all<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.699> power

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
so now he's delivered all of that power

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.870 
so now he's delivered all of that power
and<00:05:03.419> turned<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.380> into<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:05.070> speed<00:05:05.520> and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
and turned it into all that speed and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.490 
and turned it into all that speed and
turned<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.330> into<00:05:06.419> massive<00:05:07.139> amounts<00:05:07.440> of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
turned it into massive amounts of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.159 
turned it into massive amounts of
distance<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.449> rather<00:05:09.449> than<00:05:09.750> thinking<00:05:10.110> that

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
distance so rather than thinking that

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.350 
distance so rather than thinking that
you<00:05:10.380> need<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.620> have<00:05:10.770> all<00:05:11.070> this<00:05:11.310> distance<00:05:12.120> or

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
you need to have all this distance or

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.330 
you need to have all this distance or
all<00:05:12.570> this<00:05:12.720> travel<00:05:13.530> space<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.130> club

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
all this travel space with the club

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.730 
all this travel space with the club
during<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.970> backswing<00:05:15.419> I<00:05:15.660> want<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.530> learn

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
during the backswing I want you to learn

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.200 
during the backswing I want you to learn
how<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:16.979> load<00:05:17.370> up<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.699> right<00:05:17.850> side<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
how to load up the right side of the

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.060 
how to load up the right side of the
body<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.539> then<00:05:18.840> learn<00:05:19.139> how<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.380> unload<00:05:19.889> it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
body and then learn how to unload it

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.890 
body and then learn how to unload it
into<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> left<00:05:20.610> side<00:05:20.760> properly<00:05:21.389> by

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
into the left side properly by

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.840 
into the left side properly by
externally<00:05:22.470> rotating<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.100> left<00:05:23.340> leg<00:05:23.580> and

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
externally rotating that left leg and

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.480 
externally rotating that left leg and
then<00:05:24.000> using<00:05:24.660> your<00:05:24.810> big<00:05:25.110> muscles<00:05:25.410> in<00:05:25.860> your<00:05:25.919> core

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
then using your big muscles in your core

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.550 
then using your big muscles in your core
to<00:05:27.090> create<00:05:27.360> rotation<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.050> get<00:05:28.169> your<00:05:28.350> hands

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
to create rotation and get your hands

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.140 
to create rotation and get your hands
and<00:05:28.770> arms<00:05:28.860> moved<00:05:29.310> into<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.610> position<00:05:29.789> where

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
and arms moved into a position where

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.969 
and arms moved into a position where
they<00:05:30.240> can<00:05:30.300> release<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.830> most

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
they can release that's the most

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.430 
they can release that's the most
critical<00:05:32.280> part<00:05:32.849> of<00:05:33.060> taking<00:05:33.810> power<00:05:34.139> and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
critical part of taking power and

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.409 
critical part of taking power and
turning<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:34.830> into<00:05:34.889> speed<00:05:35.310> all<00:05:35.970> right<00:05:36.150> we<00:05:36.300> want

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
turning it into speed all right we want

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.690 
turning it into speed all right we want
to<00:05:36.570> store<00:05:36.900> up<00:05:36.960> power<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:37.710> then<00:05:38.220> turn<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:38.580> into

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
to store up power and then turn it into

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.250 
to store up power and then turn it into
speed<00:05:39.090> right<00:05:39.300> at<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.479> right<00:05:39.630> time<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.110> you

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
speed right at the right time and you

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.409 
speed right at the right time and you
can<00:05:40.410> see<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:40.860> Jason<00:05:41.220> day<00:05:41.430> obviously<00:05:42.000> makes<00:05:42.240> a

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
can see that Jason day obviously makes a

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.330 
can see that Jason day obviously makes a
ton<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.690> speed<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.320> he<00:05:43.740> does<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.160> most

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
ton of speed and he does it the most

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.490 
ton of speed and he does it the most
effective<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:44.970> efficient<00:05:45.330> way<00:05:45.360> possible<00:05:45.500> all

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
effective and efficient way possible all

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.830 
effective and efficient way possible all
right<00:05:46.770> so<00:05:46.950> take<00:05:47.190> that<00:05:47.400> work<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.360> it<00:05:48.479> work<00:05:48.720> on

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
right so take that work on it work on

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.170 
right so take that work on it work on
getting<00:05:49.200> yourself<00:05:49.530> in<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.710> your<00:05:49.770> left<00:05:49.950> side
