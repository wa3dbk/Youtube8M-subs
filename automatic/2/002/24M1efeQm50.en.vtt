00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.360 

later<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.109> today<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.379> wanted<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> introduce<00:00:07.980> you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
later on today I wanted to introduce you

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.280 
later on today I wanted to introduce you
to<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> app<00:00:08.910> as<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.389> speed<00:00:09.660> increase<00:00:09.990> which

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
to the app as the speed increase which

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
to the app as the speed increase which
helps<00:00:10.620> us<00:00:10.740> increase<00:00:11.010> our<00:00:11.429> SD<00:00:11.820> card<00:00:12.059> reading

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
helps us increase our SD card reading

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.470 
helps us increase our SD card reading
speed<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.429> very<00:00:14.580> helpful<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
speed so this is very helpful for the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.990 
speed so this is very helpful for the
media<00:00:15.870> scanner<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.800> opening<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.460> folders

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
media scanner and opening up folders

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.970 
media scanner and opening up folders
which<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.750> lot<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.020> folders<00:00:19.410> inside<00:00:19.650> them

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
which have a lot of folders inside them

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.640 
which have a lot of folders inside them
on<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.310> other<00:00:20.789> files<00:00:21.260> basically<00:00:22.260> makes<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
on or other files basically makes the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.040 
on or other files basically makes the
reading<00:00:22.890> faster<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.949> by<00:00:25.949> default<00:00:26.840> it<00:00:27.840> should

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
reading faster so by default it should

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.160 
reading faster so by default it should
be<00:00:28.260> set<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.099> value<00:00:30.710> 128<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:33.110> even<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
be set to this value 128 but even the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
be set to this value 128 but even the
apps<00:00:34.350> tells<00:00:34.710> us<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.180> mentioned

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
apps tells us that the one mentioned

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.069 
apps tells us that the one mentioned
here<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.559> best<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.340> before<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.850> let<00:00:39.480> us<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
here is best but before that let us do a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.130 
here is best but before that let us do a
little<00:00:40.500> test<00:00:41.030> I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.780> SD

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
little test I'm going to start up SD

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.130 
little test I'm going to start up SD
tools<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.360> it's<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> measure<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
tools up and it's going to measure the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.790 
tools up and it's going to measure the
SD<00:00:46.530> cards<00:00:46.890> reading<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> writing<00:00:47.969> speed<00:00:48.800> but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
SD cards reading and writing speed but

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
SD cards reading and writing speed but
right<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.250> only<00:00:50.579> focus<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> reading

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
right now we only focus on the reading

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.910 
right now we only focus on the reading
speed

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
speed

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.720 
speed
I'm<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.129> start<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> test<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
I'm gonna start the test now and

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
I'm gonna start the test now and
currently<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.180> these<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.660> our<00:00:57.780> read

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
currently you can see these are our read

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
currently you can see these are our read
results<00:00:59.510> 70<00:01:00.510> point<00:01:00.750> seven<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.660> let's<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.899> what

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
results 70 point seven so let's see what

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
results 70 point seven so let's see what
will<00:01:04.199> happen<00:01:04.559> once<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.880> tool<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:09.180> are

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
will happen once we use this tool we are

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.640 
will happen once we use this tool we are
going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.369> set<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> recommended<00:01:12.240> value

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.219 

there<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.390> also<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> not

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
there we go and also this is not

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.679 
there we go and also this is not
permanent<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.210> only<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
permanent by the way this will only do

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
permanent by the way this will only do
this<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> app<00:01:23.009> running<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.580> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this if you have the app running so it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
this if you have the app running so it
is<00:01:23.759> recommended<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> enable<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.080> option<00:01:25.290> set

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is recommended to enable this option set

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.030 
is recommended to enable this option set
on<00:01:25.770> every<00:01:26.009> boot<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> when<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.420> home

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
on every boot so that when your home

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.910 
on every boot so that when your home
powers<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> boots<00:01:30.170> will<00:01:31.170> start<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.619> app

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
powers on and boots will start this app

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
powers on and boots will start this app
along<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.290> system<00:01:35.360> there<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
along with the with your system there is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
along with the with your system there is
also<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> way<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> permanent<00:01:38.670> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
also a way to have this permanent but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
also a way to have this permanent but
maybe<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> near<00:01:40.079> future<00:01:40.320> I'll<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
maybe in the near future I'll see if I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
maybe in the near future I'll see if I
can<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> video<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:42.720> let's

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
can make a video of it but for now let's

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
can make a video of it but for now let's
just<00:01:43.470> stick<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.729> enable<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
just stick with this so enable this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
just stick with this so enable this
option<00:01:47.149> tap<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> button<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.220> you

option tap on the button here and you
are<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.460> free<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> go<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> now<00:01:52.200> again

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
are now free to go back and now again

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.060 
are now free to go back and now again
let<00:01:52.950> us<00:01:53.040> perform<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.540> test<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.979> if

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
let us perform it a test to see if

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.870 
let us perform it a test to see if
anything<00:01:56.399> has<00:01:56.520> changed<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:58.490> say<00:01:59.490> hello<00:01:59.820> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
anything has changed and say hello to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.289 
anything has changed and say hello to
our<00:02:00.090> new<00:02:00.210> reading<00:02:00.750> speed<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:01.979> 44<00:02:02.790> point

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
our new reading speed it is now 44 point

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
our new reading speed it is now 44 point
too<00:02:04.490> much<00:02:05.490> much<00:02:05.820> better<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.619> yeah<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.399> try

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
too much much better so yeah you can try

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.389 
too much much better so yeah you can try
this<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:08.940> yourself

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
this out for yourself

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.110 
this out for yourself
and<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.810> can<00:02:12.019> notice<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.500> difference<00:02:13.120> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and you can notice the difference and

need to do just be sure to enable this

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.509 
need to do just be sure to enable this
option<00:02:18.920> here<00:02:19.360> set<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> every<00:02:20.750> reboot<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:22.250> order
