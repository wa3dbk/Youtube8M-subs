00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
of shapes and faces within the tree many

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430 
of shapes and faces within the tree many
people<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.760> also<00:02:41.330> sought<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.870> deciduous

people have also sought this deciduous

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.970 
people have also sought this deciduous
tree<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.820> upside-down<00:02:44.300> tree<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:45.320> they

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
tree to be the upside-down tree as they

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.090 
tree to be the upside-down tree as they
look<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.489> across<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.269> landscape<00:02:47.800> as<00:02:48.800> we

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
look at it across the landscape as we

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.009 
look at it across the landscape as we
discover<00:02:49.519> more<00:02:49.880> about<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.450> tree<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.870> we

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
discover more about the tree and we

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.500 
discover more about the tree and we
talked<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.470> Richard<00:02:51.860> will<00:02:52.519> also<00:02:52.850> find<00:02:53.090> out<00:02:53.300> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
talked to Richard will also find out a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.170 
talked to Richard will also find out a
little<00:02:53.870> bit<00:02:54.050> about<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.709> tree<00:02:55.069> being<00:02:55.760> used<00:02:56.030> as

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
little bit about this tree being used as

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:08.460 
little bit about this tree being used as
a<00:02:56.209> compass

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.650 

so<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.740> we<00:03:10.010> get<00:03:10.220> lost<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.940> bush<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:11.480> we

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
so if we get lost in the bush then we

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.040 
so if we get lost in the bush then we
don't<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> compass<00:03:12.700> then<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:14.090> look<00:03:14.300> for

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
don't have a compass then we look for

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.660 
don't have a compass then we look for
the<00:03:15.080> Bobo<00:03:15.560> trees<00:03:15.860> if<00:03:16.100> we<00:03:16.459> see<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:18.050> red-billed

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
the Bobo trees if we see the red-billed

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.900 
the Bobo trees if we see the red-billed
Buffalo<00:03:19.670> Weaver<00:03:19.880> nest<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.220> trees<00:03:22.490> we<00:03:22.730> know

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
Buffalo Weaver nest on the trees we know

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.240 
Buffalo Weaver nest on the trees we know
that<00:03:23.180> they<00:03:23.990> are<00:03:24.200> nesting<00:03:24.830> boat<00:03:25.010> at<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
that they are nesting boat at the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.290 
that they are nesting boat at the
Western<00:03:25.670> direction<00:03:26.209> then<00:03:26.990> we<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.470> that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
Western direction then we know that

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.990 
Western direction then we know that
versus<00:03:29.300> that<00:03:29.510> way<00:03:29.810> then<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:31.040> one<00:03:31.250> so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
versus that way then is that one so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.280 
versus that way then is that one so
those<00:03:32.540> nurse<00:03:33.200> helps<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.980> lot<00:03:34.130> for<00:03:34.430> us<00:03:34.459> maybe<00:03:35.290> we
