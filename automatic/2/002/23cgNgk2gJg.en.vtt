00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello here thierry farmers 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.070
 today I will introduce you to the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070
 sowing in gray green 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.370
 then sowing in the revered consists of 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.850
 sow seeds of variety of species 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.440
 different in order to enrich one's soil one 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.910
 can use it in farming of 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.520
 conservation there are different 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.869
 techniques that exist and I'm going to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.610
 present what it is 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.500
 the smi green fertilizers is growing 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.720
 used by farmers this is a 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
 ancestral technique that comes back over 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260
 in addition to the taste of the day 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.390
 it allows us to save already 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.280
 tillage so a little less than 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.050
 gasoil the lesser use of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.059
 tractors and also to use the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.699
 qualities of different roots 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.530
 to work alone so to have a 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.269
 better soil quality without having to 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.760
 plow for example then there behind 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.149
 me you have the seeder then he is 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.039
 composed of two things 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.390
 particular, ie the cash register 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.420
 the back which is the only black 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.860
 traditional good traditional if you want 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.390
 this one is a model of 4 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.420
 meters wide which is not necessarily 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.420
 running everywhere with a system which a 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.220
 ten to the back 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.350
 then it is composed of a hopper of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 transmission ducting systems 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.360
 seeds and a ventilation that allows 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.790
 of getting in the back and particularity 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.549
 he is hitched on a stubble so that 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.070
 allows faster seeding at a 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.899
 speed during 19 km hour whereas at 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.180
 those - classic bow can not go 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.329
 at seven or eight kilometers other hour 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 particularity it is dominated by a 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.369
 other to see a mini grain drill 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.409
 that is, all the seeds 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.229
 is sown by two nights the first so 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.540
 the big night that contains the most 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.490
 big seeds in this case here we have 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.180
 a mixture of three big seeds that 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.460
 is oats from the country and point 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 fodder and so they are putting themselves in 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.979
 rank at the back while at the front 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.200
 you have a mixture that is composed of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.380
 three seeds him too who is from the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.860
 brown mustard clover violet radish 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.260
 forage 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.660
 so this seed set can 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.040
 pass directly on stubble so 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 after the harvest 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.150
 as you can see here 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.610
 green manure is made to enrich the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.440
 soil it can be composed of several 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.110
 seed types so you first have 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.590
 grasses like ai if I use 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 oats 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 then you have the legumes that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.930
 lets bring the zot i see game 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.180
 lowering weights and clover and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.790
 then you have cruciferous here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.930
 brown mustard and radish foraging 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 allow us to have a development 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.880
 at ground level and to have a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.840
 action at the root level the purpose of the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.970
 game is to have the the best soil 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.150
 worked without using precisely the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.070
 tools the practice of fertilizer semide 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.290
 green so this type there allows us 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.030
 theoretically to spend less so 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.600
 of tools so less wear have a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 diesel fuel 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.310
 less pollution too and to have a 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.650
 better work at ground level the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.540
 roots have the function of working the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.150
 ground as we can do it and so 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.150
 replace the used of traditional tools 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.640
 so I hope you've learned one 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.680
 little more about the farmer's 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.180
 the agriculture of now and I you 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.100

 see you soon on the farmer 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:04:00.440
 today thanks and bye
