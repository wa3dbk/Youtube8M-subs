 we understand 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 and we 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 if 75 wide 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.850
 count a single song 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 until we have to feel calm 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.480
 and my idea was not so successful 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.640
 aguirre 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 the immense 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.439
 I'm home 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.439
 she was preparing this appointment and direct 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 with this new line of products 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 I finally have the CEO this year 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.910
 many more serious 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.110
 santana the resistance 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.100
 nerve earrings 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.929
 and also think that the word 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.340
 millions of viewers across the country 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.820
 so you'll have to get used to it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.700
 vega polo 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.080
 he said now 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
 Sunday 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.670
 Title iii 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.430
 Alice in Wonderland 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.300
 in principle it seems simple 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.080
 is flying through the mafalda space to a small planet 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.839
 after a walk I discovered a castle tula plants 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.189
 get in 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.059
 she is very scared 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 this has been a very little meeting 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 Thank you 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.709
 when there is no evidence that any 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.529
 scares and wakes up and lies down very well 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
 in the world 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.079
 without cutting 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.079
 if you realize that in your pocket you have the perfume bottle 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 and that apparent objectivity that I have done very well 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 they threw 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.170
 I thought that this activity is because you are enduring 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.209
 you can go well 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.809
 the woman comes 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.110
 the country at a time and it has done well 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.799
 crime 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.999
 at the beginning to the end 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.719
 the symptoms that make you stick but then see what is more 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.809
 surprised everyone changed their minds and did not care to do it 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.219
 I think that in the end it's more difficult for you to try to do it well because you wanted 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.059
 It will be finished as soon as possible, all of you attentively. This is not what it seems. 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.740
 they said that there are more also took in a medieval era 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.339
 for example min 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.159
 the directors of his relative 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 two 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.140
 mythic is what we are going to put calm that it was time for the state to allocate 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.080
 to projects 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.389
 exhorted the future with a page on facebook or twitter 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.389
 like what they say if I'll do something similar again 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:19.819
 is incredible 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.889
 the equalizer 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.889
 in this context he framed these carbon aids 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.069
 said that they would not come back to share 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.069
 surely it will be the last one in any case 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.249
 because they have 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.389
 inter later
