I've<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.009> several<00:01:35.340> months<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I've had this for several months and it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
I've had this for several months and it
hasn't<00:01:36.360> dried<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.229> yet<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.040> only

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hasn't dried out at all yet the only

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.010 
hasn't dried out at all yet the only
downside<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> price<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.600> believe<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
downside is the price I believe it's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
downside is the price I believe it's
around<00:01:40.170> 19<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.189> 20<00:01:41.490> dollars<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.210> going

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
around 19 or 20 dollars so it is going

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.929 
around 19 or 20 dollars so it is going
to<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.780> costly<00:01:43.320> compared<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> other<00:01:44.640> two

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to be costly compared to the other two

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.340 
to be costly compared to the other two
that<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.450> show<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> next<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.079> they

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.120 
then also what I like about this on the
other<00:03:26.670> ends<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:28.170> moisturizer<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.100> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
other ends is a moisturizer it's like a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.940 
other ends is a moisturizer it's like a
lip<00:03:29.430> balm<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.690> take<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.110> off<00:03:31.380> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
lip balm so you just take this off and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.160 
lip balm so you just take this off and
then<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.400> apply<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.090> lip<00:03:33.450> balm<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:33.989> rub

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
then you just apply the lip balm and rub

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.990 
then you just apply the lip balm and rub
it<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.470> top<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.070> stain<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.640> keeps<00:03:35.850> your

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
it on top of the stain and it keeps your

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.300 
it on top of the stain and it keeps your
lips<00:03:36.269> nice<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.810> moist<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.590> only<00:03:37.890> thing<00:03:38.130> with

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
lips nice and moist the only thing with

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.240 
lips nice and moist the only thing with
that<00:03:38.610> hold<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.660> got<00:03:39.810> lipstick<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.470> so

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that hold on I got lipstick on it so

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.850 
that hold on I got lipstick on it so
that<00:03:41.400> looks<00:03:41.610> lovely<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:43.079> only<00:03:43.290> thing<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
that looks lovely the only thing with it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.740 
that looks lovely the only thing with it
is<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.970> almost<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.329> little<00:03:45.480> glue

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
is it it's almost like a little glue

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.140 
is it it's almost like a little glue
stick<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.350> little<00:03:46.620> part<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.489> here<00:03:47.880> can

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
stick but the little part right here can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.180 
stick but the little part right here can
fall<00:03:48.420> out<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.650> careful<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.130> that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
fall out so just be careful with that

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.380 
fall out so just be careful with that
because<00:03:50.430> then<00:03:50.790> you'll<00:03:50.910> lose<00:03:51.209> your

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
because then you'll lose your

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.180 
because then you'll lose your
moisturizer<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.530> thought<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.070> was
