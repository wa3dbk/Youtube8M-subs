grocer<00:01:20.210> Oh

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.319 

we<00:01:23.850> needed<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> our<00:01:24.329> seed<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.109> first<00:01:25.439> okay

we needed that our seed in first okay

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.770 
we needed that our seed in first okay
let's<00:01:27.329> see<00:01:27.539> so<00:01:27.950> no<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.670> let<00:01:30.149> me<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.600> up

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
let's see so no we let me back this up

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:43.580 
let's see so no we let me back this up
it's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.350> too<00:01:31.590> close

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.130 

-<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:50.659> because<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.930> grow

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
- I think more because when they grow

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
- I think more because when they grow
wheatgrass<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> grocery<00:01:53.549> stores<00:01:53.820> there's

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
wheatgrass in the grocery stores there's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.800 
wheatgrass in the grocery stores there's
a<00:01:54.240> lot<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.810> seeds<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.640> could<00:01:56.850> we

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a lot of seeds in there so we could we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.850 
a lot of seeds in there so we could we
could<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:02:01.460> about<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.670> osteo<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.860> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
could put a lot about you osteo them you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.929 
could put a lot about you osteo them you
think<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.250> enough

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
think that's enough

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.960 
think that's enough
that<00:02:06.659> seems<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.289> about<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.790> or<00:02:11.940> four

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that seems like about know three or four

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.809 
that seems like about know three or four
tablespoons<00:02:12.269> uh<00:02:13.700> wheatgrass

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
tablespoons uh wheatgrass

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.150 
tablespoons uh wheatgrass
okay<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> wheatgrass<00:02:18.980> keep<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
okay so there's a wheatgrass keep it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:45.550 
okay so there's a wheatgrass keep it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
good look at this hmm look at this the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.960 
good look at this hmm look at this the
wheat<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:24.600> strip<00:03:24.989> spread<00:03:25.350> out<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:26.190> now

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
wheat it strip spread out over here now

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.370 
wheat it strip spread out over here now
at<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.620> garden<00:03:28.620> center<00:03:28.829> yes<00:03:29.459> they<00:03:30.180> put<00:03:31.139> it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
at the garden center yes they put it

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:53.750 
at the garden center yes they put it
down<00:03:31.410> kind<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.250> compact<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.319> soil<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.829> new

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:03.259 

I<00:04:01.340> think<00:04:02.340> those<00:04:02.489> are<00:04:02.640> equivalent<00:04:02.849> in<00:04:03.239> size

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
I think those are equivalent in size

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.720 
I think those are equivalent in size
okay<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.830> um<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.269> tie<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:08.250> put<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.519> in

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
okay so um we just tie it just put it in

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.089 
okay so um we just tie it just put it in
a<00:04:08.760> jar<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:11.040> trail<00:04:12.000> stays<00:04:12.599> on<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.799> acts
