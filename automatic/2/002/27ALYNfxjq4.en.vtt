00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.610 

and<00:01:27.830> then<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.040> mix<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:29.030> we'll<00:01:29.420> mix<00:01:29.630> some

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
and then we mix with that we'll mix some

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.730 
and then we mix with that we'll mix some
olive<00:01:30.979> oil<00:01:31.159> which<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:32.180> nice

dollars<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.860> will<00:04:48.979> have<00:04:49.159> more<00:04:49.639> oil<00:04:50.419> than<00:04:51.380> you

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
can kind of tweak the proportions as you

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.399
