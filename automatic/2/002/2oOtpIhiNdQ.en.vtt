00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.059
 mechanical gyroscope is not so 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.849
 complicated device however his work 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.320
 real sight 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 its properties have been studied for over 200 years 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 it would seem everything has been found long ago 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.070
 practical application and the topic is closed 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.900
 but there are always enthusiasts 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.430
 still claiming to have found more 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.719
 one amazing property namely 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.860
 gyro weight change 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 when rotated in one direction or another 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.360
 or in one or another plane while 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.170
 such conclusions as a gyroscope sound 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 overcomes gravity or gyroscope 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.250
 forms a zone of gravitational shade and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.399
 finally if the gyro speed 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.160
 exceed some critical value 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.299
 the device acquires a negative 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.869
 weight and no longer attracted to the ground 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.990
 wild fantasy pushes off of her 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 inventors 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.479
 draw diagrams of new aircraft 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 and ufologists finally understand how to work 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.820
 flying saucers thank god so what 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.939
 we are dealing a century sensation or 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.119
 the next fallacies theoretically 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.350
 weight change is possible but on such 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.900
 high speeds 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.299
 what is experimentally test it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.630
 hard however there is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.780
 ambitious comrades assure that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.280
 even observed the effect of levitation when 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.009
 rotation speed 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.350
 just within a few thousand in 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.990
 minute here we will check 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 I understand that today not everyone can 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.420
 put together an experimental setup and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.270
 personally check what he tried 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.960
 bring back in school I have this 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.660
 possibility i have made a gyroscope in 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.230
 special suspension 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.750
 produce quality parts mass more 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
 kilogram 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 balancing good beating not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 maximum speed is observed 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.750
 Rotation 5000 rpm if effect 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.770
 weight changes really 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.880
 present 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.480
 it will be noticeable on the scales 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.930
 the accuracy of which 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.660
 considering the friction in the hinges lies in 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.410
 within one gram 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.970
 but then let's start the experiments 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.970
 first unwind balanced 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.470
 horizontal gyroscope 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.270
 clockwise frankly 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.700
 the rotating flywheel will never 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.709
 fully balanced because 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.350
 impossible to make it perfect 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.080
 balancing yes and no perfect 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.650
 bearings from whence arises 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.950
 axial radial vibration transmitted 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.860
 rocker weights resulting in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.110
 and may occur minnie may increase 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.280
 or weight reduction but apparently mana is not 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.510
 able to catch 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 so small impact try 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.190
 spin the flywheel 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.420
 the other way to test the theory 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.880
 about what exactly the direction of rotation 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.920
 plays a major role in gravity and 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.030
 eclipsed but it seems 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.600
 miracle never happens can turn 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 its like that 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.520
 do a massive flywheel and with 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.540
 this is not a small rotational speed 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:07.450
 it does not make it easier even for the awards to be 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.590
 we notice it even somehow offensive but it 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.480
 still not all amused me much 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.850
 one experimenter's story which 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.770
 assured that the gyroscope will lose weight 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.040
 only in vertical plane 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.110
 rotation he conducted such an experiment 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.620
 took the bike turned it over on the saddle and 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:40.450
 behind the pedals strongly spun the rear wheel 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.760
 while the weight of his bike has decreased 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:50.680
 on two kilograms 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:53.980
 oh how amusing well I donâ€™t have a bicycle 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.420
 here hang the gyro and unwind 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.100
 vertical plane 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:04.750
 I can easily see what if 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.390
 a miracle will happen now apparently the effect 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:12.460
 weight loss is valid only on 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:15.870
 riding bikes like this 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.140
 they are not even aware that 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:25.120
 easier on the go at least 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:28.300
 a couple of pounds and that's not all possible 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.700
 at school or college you were shown 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.700
 such installation for demonstration 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.180
 forced precession if unwind 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.560
 gyro for example clockwise in 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.560
 vertical plane 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.320
 and then rotate it again by 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.800
 clockwise as seen from above 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.480
 but already in the horizontal plane then he 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.690
 how would it take off so he 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.700
 reacts to external influences and 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.950
 seeks to combine axis and direction 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.830
 its rotation 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.060
 with the axis and the direction of rotation in the new 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.000
 planes in some people suddenly 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.250
 boil this theme 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.910
 erroneous understanding of this 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:18.060
 process it seems to them that the gyroscope 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.860
 able to literally take off if its 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.200
 forcibly unleash in the second 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.750
 plane and so 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.780
 supposedly you can create inertial 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.590
 the engine put it on flying 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.190
 a plate 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.640
 but so on hi break and come to me 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.430
 sorry to upset you but you forgot about 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.130
 moment of impulse 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.100
 the gyroscope here takes off just because 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.490
 pushing off from a rotating stand 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:51.330
 and she, in turn, is repelled by 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:55.250
 table in zero gravity total momentum 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:58.250
 such a construction would be zero 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.250
 Alas 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:22.529
