00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 I question the announcer yunhyeonjin prior to the start of today's art x files 1 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.150
 Yes. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.130
 Now if the trail to a desert island'll take care of the three thorns Which one such 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 Classic now 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 Once you know the current magnetic 7 gps that can lead 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.869
 Originals are a lot of things that can be used to create creatures . 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.609
 can 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.670
 So it's a strange color. It's Samsung. It's really reform. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.109
 Uninhabited island is generally not a solution to food and shelter, so people can live 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.270
 I think that there is not. 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:37.620
 But the hero of the party today, I will do a desert island four weeks and no worries 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.960
 I want to meet someone like you today. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.960
 It would be hard to launch target 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 222 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.900
 The people who do not live on the island , 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.190
 have 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.170
 To confirm the fact , Mrs. Chan 's wife also took a boat from Muan, Jeollanam-do , 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.210
 More 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.039
 Curved road facing the road 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.820
 So long as I'm running. 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.000
 It looks like it's facing, but I'm sorry for the map on the problem. 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.429
 Scattered here and there, just look around garbage Saint 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.479
 Indeed such a place that people who accumulate 10,090 of getting if you live 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:26.049
 There will be no Korean people 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:31.539
 Kill all slammed tight 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:33.670
 The moment you go to the road, the seed oil crew is really troubled. 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.410
 It's on the right. 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.050
 2.0 You know me. 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:47.190
 It was like a tramp in breaking news. 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.420
 The more sticky the person seems to walk on 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.890
 Become clear 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 So let's turn that pack off for a long time . 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.480
 Let's turn around and look at it. There's something at the end of the road. 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:08.759
 Of course, look for those who are in need with blue Pat and shabby buildings. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:12.060
 There's even a trace of burning a laundry that's just too loud. 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.680
 There was even a monster. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:21.750
 It's like this. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.610
 I do not think he's the one. 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.650
 More and more suspicious shops 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 Let's look inside the building carefully. 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.870
 It 's not like this. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:42.140
 The bath is up to sleep 4 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 It really is someone who lives here, of course, bed and pillow 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.730
 It was completely unsatisfactory year 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.830
 Going to the synagogue 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:57.910
 Four old radio till the trail of people falls 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.240
 It looks like something . 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.010
 A man at the end 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.500
 Yes, you did. Yeah. Cbs c team . Aya. Just a second. Camera. 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.730
 Could one be filled with artists 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:18.730
 Uh, here's our 4:00. This is where we live. 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:22.240
 The elderly who allowed to shoot after persuading me will also collect my uncle 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 The last step is taking over the nature. 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:33.070
 About the time when up to be a masterpiece of garden arches me one nawatneyo 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:37.240
 I've yet to find the meantime, why do not we doing this one gonna car I 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:41.140
 Just that even when only Lugia de la Merced be 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.100
 Where did the sword suddenly appear? 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:50.080
 Bunny comfortable vaccinia closer to his belt, flow 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.709
 Itguyo knife house Oh what I staggered into the bamboo, so people attending 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.160
 order 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.340
 It's not laughing here. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.130
 The self- power of sleep is scary 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.870
 I want you to be involved with the crew. 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:09.519
 It's people that are going to eat with Hunter as June gives us 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.519
 Because I can not see it, I can not see it. 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.930
 What about the taste of uninhabited sisters 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.720
 We are all 2 at the end. 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.480
 I wonder if someone with luck would eat it 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.480
 Now, on this uninhabited island, the doctor is curious about his life. 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.800
 Now here's a little thank you for now rebuttal was Bo's thinking This legal writing 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.430
 There you are. 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.250
 Workshop alike 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:42.600
 It's not perfect or perfect, 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.200
 Of course, when I floated, I made a chair and a desk 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.850
 Weatherproof only man who could have enough to do hand-made by Will 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.600
 I can not stand it . I have everything I need. 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.600

00:04:53.649 --> 00:05:02.039
 Yes , I saw this part of convenience and combat. Do not be surprised.
