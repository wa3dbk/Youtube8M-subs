00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.170
 in eye around eye 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.230
 it was hardly work change it is nothing 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.640

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640
 that's it 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.160
 kassel 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.630
 we could not find your brother you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.630
 mean that we are not looking for yet 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 that is a completely different world in these 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.470
 recover 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 they have their own form of 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.360
 justice and how he plays in it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360
 not matter 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.390
 your leader is extremely dangerous yours 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.350
 brothers 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.350
 right 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.100
 the brother of rodney bay i'm not going 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100
 down 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.770
 He gives me my sins, they are mine 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770
 youth 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.380
 my age 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.380
 the sins of my soul 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.350
 We are brothers and I will not let you 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.350
 in the engraving 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.189
 eye around eye in original out of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.780
 Difference brought and 17 minutes is off 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.329
 16 years released and running since 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.950
 today the third april 2014 in the 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.750
 German cinemas and tells the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.329
 story of rodney base played by 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.920
 casey affleck only one of the threefold 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.479
 war for his country in Iraq, he served 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.130
 is one of the things that has seen there 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.689
 You do not want to see it first 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.310
 one of them can not be since then 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.960
 everyday life would like to pursue more 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
 not the profession of his father and his 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.830
 Brothers in the local steelworks 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.630
 follow up as he then with illegal 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.130
 street fighting beats the rounds 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 in the truest sense of the word for money 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.069
 earn and the whole thing more and more lucrative 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.540
 so it was synonymous if owe 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.489
 must settle and in ever higher 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.680
 but also dangerous circles acted 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.940
 illegal street fight whether with bound 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.530
 is confronted with the one actually 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.720
 do not want to be confronted 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.220
 yes, there he disappeared and suddenly 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.840
 his brother goes on the trail 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.459
 His brother wants to find out what 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.440
 struggling with these and that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.640
 Basically, the story is rough 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.829
 already knows how to get there 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.269
 the trailer looks around eye and eye 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.640
 the trailer is incredibly exciting 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.230
 film has a brute good cast with 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 christian bale and woody harrelson with 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.829
 casey affleck with his with fund over 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.660
 Dekker wants to go to the TV after the one or 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.519
 another known face in front of the camera 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.989
 this is just as great a class ensemble 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.950
 the movie can only be good and the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.329
 trailer is incredibly exciting 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 been cut and the film music 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.049
 It's really good that you can do it anyway 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.160
 unfortunately in the cinema must find that the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.019
 Film far behind the expectations 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.940
 lags behind is almost scary 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.769
 and there you can ask why 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.239
 That eye around eye is definite 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.650
 not bad but he is not 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.000
 Especially not good if you are 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.069
 This cast has it amazing 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
 is all scenes with woody harrelson and 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.940
 Crystal Bay in the lead are the absolute 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.980
 hammer to look incredibly intense 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.540
 and played nearly perfect as you can see 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.549
 just great performers before 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.350
 But camera can deliver and that is 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.269
 always the most important the story is true 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.859
 not the book is just not good looking 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.060
 the film is based and that it like 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.950
 with every good dish always the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.540
 basic ingredient to which one must count because 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.370
 then a film can not be more 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.650
 would be groundbreaking and that 's just it 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.940
 so a typical home, the album and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.590
 typical film that's just fine 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.420
 could represent as examples 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.069
 to whom 1 in the scene that says 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.780
 highly emotional that it spikes that 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.069
 is really great played in the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.359
 the whole movie also the action 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.860
 Do not want to get in the way it is 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.750
 long 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 partly with abstruse is partly 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 if you think about what happens in 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.030
 certain moments of action strands 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.770
 Almost card too thoughtless and 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.970
 not really nice for the audience 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.470
 to watch that you just that 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.670
 feeling has to go out and say 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.110
 the movie is good but is also 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.150
 somehow bad and that's exactly how it works 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.530
 get out and that's just the whole 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.970
 every single puzzle piece in this one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 puzzle is pretty wonderful though 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.120
 total picture well and that maybe 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.680
 Everyone understands the movie 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.870
 Also, do not just go for it 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.310
 from the name in the name of cars 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.750
 dazzle tried simply also times 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.370
 then consider that separately 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.959
 maybe it's clear, maybe that's it 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.880
 even a very subjective opinion 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.470
 a very subjective understanding of 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.060
 this movie but I would be surprised if 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.860
 I stay alone with this 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.080
 opinion there I am by my will 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.820
 Review eye to eye of mine as 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 drama and thriller due to the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.150
 great cast it and many fans see 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.980
 still six and a half out of ten 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.450
 possible points and overall 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.460
 still six out of ten possible 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.800
 Dusting points as you can see 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.150
 how much the script still a film 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 the influence and can or so strong 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 it just influences a captcha 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.570
 gives or 1 1 a limit how far 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.950
 then cast &amp; co and can go 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.870
 at least as far as my evaluation was concerned 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.370
 I look to the eye with my review 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.630
 eye let a thumb with it 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.190
 let it stay if not 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.479
 otherwise there are a few left 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.550
 and me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.870
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.360
 I hope to be here again tomorrow 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.360
 of course at 3
