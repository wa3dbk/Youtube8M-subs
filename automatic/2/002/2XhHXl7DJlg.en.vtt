00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.950
 dry the smart is a complete solution 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.360
 for the improvement of mobility and 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 road safety for drivers 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.619
 through an application installed on 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.180
 the driver 's mobile phone 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.919
 they record behaviors behind the wheel of 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.599
 telematically what will give us a 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.869
 information on the different styles of 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.869
 driving 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.980
 this information may be decisive 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.109
 in different areas such as the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.649
 insurance, professional driving or 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.649
 fleet management 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 dry the smart has been developed by 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.379
 the tilenus group formed by a team 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.790
 of technicians with more than 20 years of 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.379
 experience in the field of 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.379
 telematics and computer development 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 during the technical sessions held 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.980
 in the circuit of tepes to drivers 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.630
 professionals characterized different 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.520
 driving types reproducing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.410
 usual maneuvers with the aim of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.000
 obtain its characterization from 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.500
 the application installed in different 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.610
 Market terminals and equipment 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.610
 framed professionals 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.930
 the tests that we are doing here 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.220
 today they aim to determine the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.570
 telematic and telemetric profiles of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 certain driving maneuvers that 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.960
 we are going to expose certain teams of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.720
 telematic and telemetric measurement to 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.119
 maneuvers both moderate and medium 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.270
 as extreme to determine the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.040
 profiles of the maneuvers of form 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.820
 telematics with a telematic fingerprint 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.100
 then we can determine what is the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.289
 profile of a more aggressive driver which 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.360
 it is the oldest driving spirit 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.979
 moderate within what is each of 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.979
 the maneuvers separately 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.379
 the information of the tests that 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.349
 we are collecting today is received and is 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.180
 collected through telematics 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.319
 these telematics equipment so embarked 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.109
 in the cars that are doing the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.540
 proof are smartphone-type phones 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.459
 different characteristics we are 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.579
 taking data acceleration data 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.470
 velocity data of curves in curve and 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.629
 others that allow us to do a study 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.370
 forensic with that information and we can 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.500
 take a fingerprint of both the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 telematic information like that of the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.129
 telemetry the tests consist of 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.129
 90 degree turns 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.590
 access and exit roundabout 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.140
 prayers you look for and decelerations 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.140
 you look 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.980
 pursuit in the vicinity of vehicles 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.970
 dry the smart is an open platform 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.710
 which pursues the improvement of behavior to 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.540
 driver's wheel and allows the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.700
 insurance companies and other entities 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 know the degree of danger of the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.590
 mobility of your clients or workers 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.439
 reverse sea also enables the offer 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.390
 a wide range of services 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.250
 added value as tutelage for a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.840
 intelligent driving or even the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.069
 automatic call to a center 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.069
 emergencies in case of accident 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.820
