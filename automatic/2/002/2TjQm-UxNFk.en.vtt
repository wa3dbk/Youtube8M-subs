hi<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.609> new<00:00:06.000> video<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.629> about<00:00:06.779> your<00:00:07.109> swim

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
hi this new video is about your swim

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.280 
hi this new video is about your swim
kicks<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.300> wrong<00:00:09.510> types<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:10.050> kicks

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
kicks and how the wrong types of kicks

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.700 
kicks and how the wrong types of kicks
can<00:00:10.500> affect<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:10.980> fast<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.429> swim<00:00:12.440> I'll<00:00:13.440> be

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
can affect how fast you swim I'll be

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
can affect how fast you swim I'll be
focusing<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.370> kick<00:00:14.670> types<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.269> interfere

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
focusing on kick types that interfere

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.689 
focusing on kick types that interfere
with<00:00:15.990> your<00:00:16.379> form<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.980> momentum<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
with your form and momentum and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.380 
with your form and momentum and
therefore<00:00:18.600> slow<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.170> down<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.210> these<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
therefore slow you down and these are

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
therefore slow you down and these are
some<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> more<00:00:22.080> common<00:00:22.650> kick<00:00:22.890> errors<00:00:23.250> I'm

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
some of the more common kick errors I'm

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
some of the more common kick errors I'm
seeing<00:00:23.789> amongst<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.420> triathletes<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.410> I've

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
seeing amongst the triathletes that I've

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.540 
seeing amongst the triathletes that I've
had<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.949> chance<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.460> work<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:31.130> this<00:00:32.130> first

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
had the chance to work with this first

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.630 
had the chance to work with this first
type<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.540> call<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.960> runner's<00:00:34.260> kick

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
type I like to call the runner's kick

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.520 
type I like to call the runner's kick
because<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.850> characterized<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> backward

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
because it's characterized by a backward

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.880 
because it's characterized by a backward
whip<00:00:37.800> kick<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> person<00:00:40.410> kicks<00:00:40.649> from

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
whip kick where the person kicks from

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.970 
whip kick where the person kicks from
his<00:00:41.040> knee<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.550> her<00:00:42.120> knee<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.629> lifts<00:00:43.590> her<00:00:43.710> heel

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
his knee or her knee and lifts her heel

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970 
his knee or her knee and lifts her heel
up<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.260> were<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> flip<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
up and back and if I were to flip this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
up and back and if I were to flip this
over<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.660> looks<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.250> person

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
over it actually looks like the person

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.760 
over it actually looks like the person
is<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> running<00:00:51.840> step<00:00:52.230> forward

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
is about to take a running step forward

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.700 
is about to take a running step forward
I<00:00:53.030> see<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.780> strong<00:00:55.230> runners

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I see this in a lot of strong runners

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.430 
I see this in a lot of strong runners
and<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.520> reason<00:00:56.879> why<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.329> disruptive<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and the reason why it's so disruptive to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
and the reason why it's so disruptive to
your<00:00:58.590> stroke<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.520> adds<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
your stroke is because it adds a lot of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.090 
your stroke is because it adds a lot of
drag

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.980 

this<00:01:04.100> next<00:01:04.519> type<00:01:04.730> is<00:01:05.000> what<00:01:05.150> I<00:01:05.180> call<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.600> bikers

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
this next type is what I call the bikers

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.680 
this next type is what I call the bikers
kick<00:01:06.370> watch<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.640> knees<00:01:07.820> closely<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
kick watch the knees closely in the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:20.919 
kick watch the knees closely in the
video

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.529 

it<00:01:21.929> really<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:23.009> cycling<00:01:23.520> motion<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
it really is a cycling motion and if I

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.469 
it really is a cycling motion and if I
were<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> flip<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.079> over<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.740> before<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
were to flip it over like before the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
were to flip it over like before the
difference<00:01:27.869> between<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.590> bikers<00:01:28.950> cake<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
difference between the bikers cake is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
difference between the bikers cake is
that<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:29.759> kick<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> knees<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:31.250> versus

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that they kick from the knees up versus

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
that they kick from the knees up versus
a<00:01:32.280> while<00:01:32.609> ago<00:01:32.880> where<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> runners<00:01:33.569> tend<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
a while ago where the runners tend to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
a while ago where the runners tend to
kick<00:01:34.380> their<00:01:34.560> heels<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:38.310> third

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
kick their heels to the back the third

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.389 
kick their heels to the back the third
type<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.179> dragged<00:01:39.780> kick<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> basically

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
type is the dragged kick and basically

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.669 
type is the dragged kick and basically
this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> result<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.200> low<00:01:43.409> body

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
this is the result of a low body

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.819 
this is the result of a low body
position<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> water<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.780> position<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
position in water this position has the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.419 
position in water this position has the
worst<00:01:47.520> effects<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.450> terms<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.899> drag<00:01:49.429> it's

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
worst effects in terms of drag it's

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.279 
worst effects in terms of drag it's
usually<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.179> case<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:51.869> poor<00:01:52.789> proprioception<00:01:53.789> or

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
usually a case of poor proprioception or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.350 
usually a case of poor proprioception or
an<00:01:55.289> underdeveloped<00:01:55.920> sense<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.759> where<00:01:57.119> your

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
an underdeveloped sense of where your

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
an underdeveloped sense of where your
body<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.959> while<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.679> water<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
body is at while it's in the water I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.149 
body is at while it's in the water I
just<00:02:00.209> need<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> highlight<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.799> video

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
just need to highlight that this video

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.369 
just need to highlight that this video
this<00:02:02.429> particular<00:02:03.119> video<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.629> this<00:02:03.750> lady<00:02:04.079> was

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:04.379 
this particular video of this lady was

this particular video of this lady was
taken<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.250> February<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.149> year<00:02:06.209> and<00:02:07.220> since

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
taken in February this year and since

taken in February this year and since
then<00:02:08.549> she's<00:02:08.849> changed<00:02:09.390> her<00:02:09.509> stroke<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.190> last

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
then she's changed her stroke and last

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.500 
then she's changed her stroke and last
August<00:02:11.790> she<00:02:12.090> swam<00:02:12.360> her<00:02:12.629> first<00:02:12.900> 70.3<00:02:13.769> leg<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.510> 35

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
August she swam her first 70.3 leg in 35

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.119 
August she swam her first 70.3 leg in 35
minutes<00:02:15.780> which<00:02:16.200> isn't<00:02:16.500> bad<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.950> all

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.680 

the<00:02:22.129> fourth<00:02:22.370> type<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> most

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
the fourth type is one of the most

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.440 
the fourth type is one of the most
common<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.400> triathletes<00:02:26.299> and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
common that we see in triathletes and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.020 
common that we see in triathletes and
it's<00:02:27.140> called<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.709> scissor<00:02:27.950> kick<00:02:28.250> which<00:02:28.819> is

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's called the scissor kick which is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.199 
it's called the scissor kick which is
basically<00:02:29.650> kicking<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.950> wide<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:31.700> far

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
basically kicking so wide and so far

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.360 
basically kicking so wide and so far
apart<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:33.379> body<00:02:33.590> has<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.129> appearance

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
apart that your body has the appearance

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.730 
apart that your body has the appearance
of<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.790> pair<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> scissors

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.320 

extreme<00:02:40.740> scissor<00:02:41.070> kicks<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.670> actually<00:02:42.120> be

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
extreme scissor kicks can actually be

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.880 
extreme scissor kicks can actually be
bad<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:43.020> your<00:02:43.110> lower<00:02:43.290> back

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
bad for your lower back

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.220 
bad for your lower back
because<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.850> use<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.450> counter<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> loss

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
because you use it to counter the loss

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.090 
because you use it to counter the loss
of<00:02:46.470> balance<00:02:46.620> each<00:02:47.040> time<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.640> kick<00:02:48.710> this<00:02:49.710> last

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
of balance each time you kick this last

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460 
of balance each time you kick this last
kick<00:02:50.430> isn't<00:02:50.700> common<00:02:51.180> at<00:02:51.300> all<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.050> I've<00:02:52.260> only

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
kick isn't common at all but I've only

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.620 
kick isn't common at all but I've only
ever<00:02:52.680> seen<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.250> amongst<00:02:53.640> triathletes<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
ever seen it amongst triathletes and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.590 
ever seen it amongst triathletes and
it's<00:02:54.810> called<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.470> one-legged<00:02:56.070> kick<00:02:56.600> watch

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
it's called the one-legged kick watch

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:15.460 
it's called the one-legged kick watch
the<00:02:57.840> video<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.200> see<00:02:58.530> why<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.770> call<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.070> that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280 

here's<00:03:16.470> another<00:03:16.650> sample<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:18.300> one-legged

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
here's another sample of a one-legged

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.580 
here's another sample of a one-legged
kick<00:03:19.620> I'm<00:03:20.520> not<00:03:21.060> exactly<00:03:21.390> sure<00:03:21.780> why<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.140> happens

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
kick I'm not exactly sure why it happens

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.130 
kick I'm not exactly sure why it happens
at<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.310> would<00:03:23.880> assume<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.360> it's<00:03:24.900> another

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
at all I would assume that it's another

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.580 
at all I would assume that it's another
case<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.580> proprioception<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:27.800> mystery

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
case of proprioception it's mystery

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.840 
case of proprioception it's mystery
ultimately<00:03:31.590> what<00:03:31.890> we're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.340> our

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
ultimately what we're going for our

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.270 
ultimately what we're going for our
kicks<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.480> don't<00:03:33.690> add<00:03:33.810> drag<00:03:34.080> or<00:03:34.470> interfere

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
kicks that don't add drag or interfere

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.080 
kicks that don't add drag or interfere
with<00:03:35.459> our<00:03:35.580> form

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
with our form

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.479 
with our form
so<00:03:37.050> get<00:03:37.230> your<00:03:37.319> stroke<00:03:37.620> analyzed<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
so get your stroke analyzed and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.530 
so get your stroke analyzed and
corrected<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.360> thank<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.170> for<00:03:40.350> watching
