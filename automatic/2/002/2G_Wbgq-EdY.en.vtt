00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like this one too it's even I think more

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
like this one too it's even I think more
rare<00:00:52.289> than<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.559> other<00:00:52.829> burritos<00:00:53.280> because

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
rare than the other burritos because

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
rare than the other burritos because
this<00:00:53.910> one's<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> solid<00:00:54.690> color<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this one's like a solid color and it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
this one's like a solid color and it
doesn't<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> advertisements<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
doesn't have the advertisements on it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
doesn't have the advertisements on it
and<00:00:57.090> stuff<00:00:57.710> but<00:00:58.710> yeah<00:00:58.980> unfortunately<00:00:59.100> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and stuff but yeah unfortunately you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
and stuff but yeah unfortunately you
can't<00:00:59.879> upgrade<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.359> van<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:02.100> can't

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
can't upgrade this van at all you can't

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
can't upgrade this van at all you can't
store<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:02.940> garage<00:01:03.059> though<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.019> you

can't<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.500> full<00:01:04.680> coverage<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
can't get full coverage so it's kind of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
can't get full coverage so it's kind of
a<00:01:06.720> pointless<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.200> had<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
a pointless they had to have because it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
a pointless they had to have because it
like<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.270> blow<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.840> it'll<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.470> going

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
like if you blow it up it'll be going

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.289 
like if you blow it up it'll be going
but<00:01:11.390> yeah<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.659> cool<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.229> drive<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.770> maybe

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
but yeah be cool to drive around maybe

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.969 
but yeah be cool to drive around maybe
like<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.439> line<00:01:16.590> if<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
like a little bit on the line if the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.880 
like a little bit on the line if the
people<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> line<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.210> fairly<00:01:18.540> nice

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
people and on the line are fairly nice

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
people and on the line are fairly nice
but<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.130> blow<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.900> then<00:01:21.900> yeah<00:01:22.259> you're

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
but if they blow it up then yeah you're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.210 
but if they blow it up then yeah you're
not<00:01:22.740> gonna<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.009> able<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
not gonna be able to get back so that

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
not gonna be able to get back so that
kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> sucks

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
kind of sucks

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.680 
kind of sucks
but<00:01:28.830> yeah<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.370> pretty<00:01:29.550> cool<00:01:30.060> van<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
but yeah it's a pretty cool van to have

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.270 
but yeah it's a pretty cool van to have
like<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.290> rare<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.830> people<00:01:32.040> will

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like it's really rare and people will

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.670 
like it's really rare and people will
probably<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:32.940> cool<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
probably think it's cool if they see it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
probably think it's cool if they see it
and<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.430> hopefully<00:01:35.700> it'll<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.210> nice<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and there hopefully it'll be nice and it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
and there hopefully it'll be nice and it
won't<00:01:36.840> blow<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.230> but<00:01:37.650> yeah<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> yeah<00:01:41.190> just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
won't blow you up but yeah so yeah just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.650 
won't blow you up but yeah so yeah just
to<00:01:41.520> prove<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> store<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.510> in<00:01:42.540> your

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
to prove that you can store it in your

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.540 
to prove that you can store it in your
garage<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.010> there<00:01:44.100> quickly

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
garage I'll just put it in there quickly

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.900 
garage I'll just put it in there quickly
I<00:01:48.680> guess<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.010> an<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.460> vehicle

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
I guess would be an all right vehicle

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.670 
I guess would be an all right vehicle
for<00:01:50.940> heist<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.020> wouldn't<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
for heist but I wouldn't really

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
for heist but I wouldn't really
recommend<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.720> I

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
recommend it because it's like like I

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
recommend it because it's like like I
said<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.770> can't<00:01:56.010> put<00:01:56.160> full<00:01:56.400> coverage<00:01:56.760> on<00:01:56.940> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
said you can't put full coverage on it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.950 
said you can't put full coverage on it
so<00:01:57.300> if<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.570> blows<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.260> lose<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
so if it blows up you're gonna lose it

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
so if it blows up you're gonna lose it
but<00:02:00.960> yeah<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.800> can't<00:02:02.040> store

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
but yeah as you can see you can't store

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
but yeah as you can see you can't store
it<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.520> garage<00:02:02.670> which<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:05.060> but<00:02:06.060> yeah

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it in your garage which is good but yeah

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.520 
it in your garage which is good but yeah
that's<00:02:06.390> pretty<00:02:06.600> much<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.260> van<00:02:07.500> a
