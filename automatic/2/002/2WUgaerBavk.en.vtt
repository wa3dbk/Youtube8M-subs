00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear neverland ranch you have 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.839
 a camera and can you your age 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.719
 say loud then you are defined for 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:16.410
 my new video under 1 video reviews 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.960
 I'll give away this socket of the film 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.050
 It will be called neverland 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.359
 venture from zero to question mark 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.340
 Step 1 take your camera in the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.010
 camera which also says okay 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.949
 your age in my case 28 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.140
 download this video on youtube 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.690
 not listed and send it an action 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 vegas at gmx.de sends me no 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 files are the mailbox full and me 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.890
 can no longer write so what 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829
 just the ring 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 the idea is completely clear in the mind it is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 a super hard out of my head 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.340
 get out and formulate that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 that you can understand that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.879
 I try something for every vintage person 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.920
 Find 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.020
 problem will pay at the beginning of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.210
 zero of the 17th 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.469
 a bit hard to find people there 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 So whether the little sibling 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.299
 hold the camera up and say says 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.700
 is an old and sibling 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.799
 because either way you have little 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 safe digging was salvaged 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.900
 Hold on and say 0 that will be one 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.619
 challenge and then look how 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.439
 far as we come 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 you can also ask your parents and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.229
 neverland ranch omis and neverland ranch 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.040
 bubis with everyone I've got something 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.659
 to forget 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 I'm currently watching the video 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.720
 second time because you first have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.720
 I totally for puzzle 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.930
 something like all of us 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 complicate 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.700
 I think so in two weeks or so 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.040
 I write on facebook which 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.390
 pay is still lacking and easy 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 twitter everywhere 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.450
 It may be a long-term project 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.410
 maybe not 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.720
 that depends entirely on you, oh yes exactly 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.150
 everyone can join in it does not matter if 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.630
 one is in the vintage 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.440
 or 20 if it's 20 , I blind everyone 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.800
 20 people and everyone says 23 or something 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.690
 always 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.080
 but I need at least one 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.570
 person per age and now stays too 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.500
 only one question remains why wears 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.500
 like that one cap 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.930
 I always say minis are the hats under 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.659
 to benefit 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.329
 that's what they say so I also have 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.129
 Funny socks to look like 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.459
 they are dirty but they are not 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.769
 washed and still so that 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.959
 That's it , that's what I was talking about 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.280
 because here, by the way, I have the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.620
 most boring part of my bedroom 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.720
 Not chosen because I'm just mine 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.019
 Tripod is not there and the camera on 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.629
 Battery hangs battery depends on the current you know 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.939
 already means no no it is there for it 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.810
 not from the terrific video.de 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.459
 distract 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.180
 I look forward to your videos until then 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.180
 I wish you something else
