an underarm mesh gusset and we've called

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
an underarm mesh gusset and we've called
it<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.260> color<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:54.059> as

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
it out in color so this is about as

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and back on the garment is constructed

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760

weights of mesh and that was really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.670 
weights of mesh and that was really
inspired<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> lines<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> court

side seam and your back yoke have been

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
side seam and your back yoke have been

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
distraction solution a little bit less

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.420 
distraction solution a little bit less
thread<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> bulk<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:49.070> less<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.280> be

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
thread and bulk a little less to be

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.940 
thread and bulk a little less to be
worried<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.790> while<00:01:51.180> you're<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> court

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
worried about while you're on the court

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
worried about while you're on the court
finally<00:01:52.950> we've<00:01:53.130> angled<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> side<00:01:53.880> seam<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
finally we've angled the side seam so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.480 
finally we've angled the side seam so
that<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> falls<00:01:54.930> closer<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> front<00:01:55.979> that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that it falls closer to the front that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.760 
that it falls closer to the front that's
another<00:01:56.790> way<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> create<00:01:57.840> less<00:01:58.079> distraction

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
another way to create less distraction
