and that's one of the issues i have this
case<00:02:25.480> there<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.840> little<00:02:26.019> bits<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.319> flash<00:02:26.560> like

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
case there are little bits of flash like

that<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.299> prominently

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that you can see it really prominently

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.390 
that you can see it really prominently
there<00:02:29.080> there's<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.680> little<00:02:29.860> bit<00:02:30.040> around<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
there there's a little bit around the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520 
there there's a little bit around the
top<00:02:30.640> here<00:02:30.940> which<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.900> sort<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.140> worn<00:02:32.349> out

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
top here which is sort of worn out

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.990 
top here which is sort of worn out
because<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.890> taking<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.250> fun<00:02:33.459> out<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.819> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
because of taking the fun out of the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.930 
because of taking the fun out of the
case<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.480> can<00:02:34.599> just<00:02:34.840> about<00:02:35.049> see<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.349> there

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
case but you can just about see it there

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.920 
case but you can just about see it there
there's<00:02:36.940> also<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> little<00:02:37.329> bit<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.629> corner

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
there's also a little bit on the corner

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.899 
there's also a little bit on the corner
here<00:02:37.959> which<00:02:38.920> I've<00:02:39.129> cut<00:02:39.340> back<00:02:39.549> slightly

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
here which I've cut back slightly

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.089 
here which I've cut back slightly
because<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.239> was<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.480> bit<00:02:40.629> worse<00:02:41.099> and

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
because it was a little bit worse and

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.470 
because it was a little bit worse and
then<00:02:42.159> also<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.519> bottom<00:02:42.819> here<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
then also the bottom here just the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.030 
then also the bottom here just the
attention<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.930> detail<00:02:44.049> with<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.769> rubber

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
attention to detail with this rubber

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.430 
attention to detail with this rubber
here<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.519> not<00:02:45.730> quite<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.359> I'd<00:02:46.720> expect<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.410> a

of this without this little issue here

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.640 
of this without this little issue here
because<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.849> really<00:03:16.090> does<00:03:16.359> irritate<00:03:17.230> me<00:03:17.530> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
because it really does irritate me and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.990 
because it really does irritate me and
I've<00:03:17.709> tried<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.099> sort<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.310> where<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.639> back<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
I've tried to sort of where it back and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.099 
I've tried to sort of where it back and
I<00:03:19.030> know<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.329> if<00:03:19.419> I<00:03:19.480> keep<00:03:19.660> rubbing<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.019> and

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
I know that if I keep rubbing it and

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.059 
I know that if I keep rubbing it and
rubbing<00:03:20.349> it<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.829> come<00:03:20.919> away

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
rubbing it it's going to come away

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.550 
rubbing it it's going to come away
eventually<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.930> shouldn't<00:03:23.200> be<00:03:23.319> able<00:03:23.440> to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
eventually but you shouldn't be able to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.280 
eventually but you shouldn't be able to
do<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:23.919> think<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.220> case<00:03:24.400> retails<00:03:24.910> for

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
do that I think the case retails for

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.780 
do that I think the case retails for
about<00:03:26.290> 24<00:03:26.950> pounds<00:03:27.099> i'll<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.549> check<00:03:27.730> that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
about 24 pounds i'll have to check that

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030 
about 24 pounds i'll have to check that
out<00:03:28.000> put<00:03:28.239> an<00:03:28.329> annotation<00:03:28.450> there<00:03:29.049> with<00:03:29.950> the

out put an annotation there with the

out put an annotation there with the
price<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:31.269> for<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.480> price<00:03:31.629> they<00:03:31.930> shouldn't

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
price but for the price they shouldn't

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.440 
price but for the price they shouldn't
really<00:03:32.769> be<00:03:32.889> having<00:03:33.160> those<00:03:33.220> issues<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:34.329> other

the<00:04:42.219> phone<00:04:42.430> i<00:04:42.610> would<00:04:42.909> just<00:04:43.270> be<00:04:43.419> careful<00:04:43.780> to

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
the phone i would just be careful to

the phone i would just be careful to
wipe<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.349> down<00:04:44.500> every<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:44.889> often<00:04:45.039> so<00:04:45.219> if<00:04:45.400> you

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
wipe it down every so often so if you

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.760 
wipe it down every so often so if you
get<00:04:45.639> sand<00:04:45.969> or<00:04:46.180> grit<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.659> back<00:04:46.840> here<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.500> you

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
get sand or grit and back here and you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.290 
get sand or grit and back here and you

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
scratching it and put it in I just

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.110 
scratching it and put it in I just
tended<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.419> drop<00:04:52.659> the<00:04:53.050> left<00:04:53.229> side<00:04:53.469> in<00:04:53.620> first

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
tended to drop the left side in first

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.800 
tended to drop the left side in first
and<00:04:55.120> then<00:04:55.960> just<00:04:56.199> snap<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.069> over<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:58.569> it<00:04:58.689> pretty

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
and then just snap it over and it pretty

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.360 
and then just snap it over and it pretty
much<00:04:58.900> fits<00:04:59.169> perfectly<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.740> occasionally<00:05:00.009> you

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
much fits perfectly you occasionally you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.520 
much fits perfectly you occasionally you
can<00:05:00.520> see<00:05:00.699> here<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.629> rubber<00:05:01.870> lips<00:05:02.139> slightly

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
can see here the rubber lips slightly

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.570 
can see here the rubber lips slightly
caught<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:05.770> might<00:05:06.039> want<00:05:06.159> to<00:05:06.190> play<00:05:06.370> with<00:05:06.460> it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
caught so you might want to play with it

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.189 
caught so you might want to play with it
a<00:05:06.639> tiny<00:05:06.849> bit<00:05:07.030> just<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.210> get<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.479> line<00:05:07.659> up<00:05:07.840> but

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
a tiny bit just to get it to line up but

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.809 
a tiny bit just to get it to line up but
that<00:05:08.289> should<00:05:08.440> be<00:05:08.560> fine<00:05:08.770> all<00:05:09.219> your<00:05:09.400> senses<00:05:09.699> on

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
that should be fine all your senses on

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
the front completely unobscured camera

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.260 
the front completely unobscured camera
is<00:05:12.069> completely<00:05:12.460> an<00:05:12.550> obscure<00:05:12.849> when<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.090> take

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
is completely an obscure when you take

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.050 
is completely an obscure when you take
photos<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:14.650> it's<00:05:15.069> pretty<00:05:15.159> good<00:05:15.400> case<00:05:15.580> guys<00:05:15.819> I

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
photos so it's pretty good case guys I

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.939 
photos so it's pretty good case guys I
just<00:05:16.539> wish<00:05:16.810> they'd<00:05:17.169> sort<00:05:17.349> out<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.710> little

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
just wish they'd sort out that little

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.680 
just wish they'd sort out that little
quality<00:05:18.460> issue<00:05:18.580> with<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.000> flash<00:05:19.240> because<00:05:19.509> if

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
quality issue with the flash because if

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.420 
quality issue with the flash because if
they<00:05:19.750> got<00:05:19.930> rid<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.110> that<00:05:20.169> there's<00:05:21.069> not<00:05:21.219> much

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
they got rid of that there's not much

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.890 
they got rid of that there's not much
bad<00:05:21.699> i<00:05:21.729> can<00:05:22.000> say<00:05:22.150> about<00:05:22.270> this<00:05:22.479> case<00:05:22.719> it

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
bad i can say about this case it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.110 
bad i can say about this case it
provides<00:05:23.199> me<00:05:23.379> with<00:05:23.440> protection<00:05:24.129> and<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.849> feel

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
provides me with protection and I feel

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.610 
provides me with protection and I feel
almost<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.719> secure<00:05:26.080> with<00:05:26.199> this<00:05:26.289> is<00:05:26.409> with<00:05:26.529> an

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
almost to secure with this is with an

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.409 
almost to secure with this is with an
otterbox<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.460> feels<00:05:27.610> much<00:05:27.939> nicer<00:05:28.210> in

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
otterbox but this feels much nicer in

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.749 
otterbox but this feels much nicer in
the<00:05:28.479> hand<00:05:28.719> it's<00:05:29.229> much<00:05:29.469> smaller<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:30.129> follows

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
the hand it's much smaller it follows

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.369 
the hand it's much smaller it follows
the<00:05:30.849> contours<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.419> device<00:05:31.719> really<00:05:32.080> nicely

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
the contours of the device really nicely

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.809 
the contours of the device really nicely
so<00:05:32.680> when<00:05:32.800> you're<00:05:32.919> holding<00:05:33.219> it<00:05:33.340> you're<00:05:33.610> aware

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
so when you're holding it you're aware

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.269 
so when you're holding it you're aware
that<00:05:34.029> is<00:05:34.150> much<00:05:34.300> bigger<00:05:34.569> but<00:05:35.529> it<00:05:35.919> doesn't<00:05:36.250> feel

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
that is much bigger but it doesn't feel

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.980 
that is much bigger but it doesn't feel
sort<00:05:36.969> of<00:05:37.029> quite<00:05:37.240> as<00:05:37.330> monstrous<00:05:37.690> as<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
sort of quite as monstrous as the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.480 
sort of quite as monstrous as the
otterbox<00:05:38.409> does<00:05:38.620> which<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.979> ruins<00:05:39.340> the

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
otterbox does which the ruins the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.740 
otterbox does which the ruins the
aesthetic<00:05:39.550> slightly<00:05:40.210> more<00:05:40.360> than<00:05:40.389> this<00:05:40.539> does

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
aesthetic slightly more than this does

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.959 
aesthetic slightly more than this does
and<00:05:41.319> if<00:05:41.560> this<00:05:41.710> was<00:05:41.919> cooler<00:05:42.159> colors<00:05:42.520> again<00:05:42.639> I'd

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
and if this was cooler colors again I'd

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.760 
and if this was cooler colors again I'd
really<00:05:43.270> love<00:05:43.539> this<00:05:43.719> I<00:05:43.870> easily<00:05:44.139> buy<00:05:44.469> some<00:05:44.680> of

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
really love this I easily buy some of

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.769 
really love this I easily buy some of
these<00:05:44.830> my<00:05:45.129> own<00:05:45.279> money<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:45.909> never<00:05:46.150> buy<00:05:46.300> cases

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
these my own money and I never buy cases

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.240 
these my own money and I never buy cases
my<00:05:46.990> money<00:05:47.289> because<00:05:47.529> I<00:05:47.589> get<00:05:47.710> them<00:05:47.830> for<00:05:47.949> review

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
my money because I get them for review

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.610 
my money because I get them for review
so<00:05:48.669> that<00:05:48.759> shows<00:05:48.969> you<00:05:49.029> sort<00:05:49.330> of<00:05:49.389> how<00:05:49.569> good<00:05:49.870> this

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
so that shows you sort of how good this

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.980 
so that shows you sort of how good this
case<00:05:50.889> is<00:05:51.099> how<00:05:51.250> much<00:05:51.370> I<00:05:51.490> like<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.419> plastic

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
case is how much I like it the plastic

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.480 
case is how much I like it the plastic
scuffs<00:05:53.259> a<00:05:53.379> little<00:05:53.589> bit<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:53.979> was<00:05:54.099> really

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
scuffs a little bit but I was really

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.010 
scuffs a little bit but I was really
hammering<00:05:54.819> it<00:05:54.969> for<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.180> few<00:05:55.389> days<00:05:55.509> especially

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
hammering it for the few days especially

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.659 
hammering it for the few days especially
the<00:05:56.349> week<00:05:56.500> I've<00:05:56.710> been<00:05:56.740> using<00:05:56.979> it<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.310> was

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
the week I've been using it I was

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.070 
the week I've been using it I was
spinning<00:05:57.909> out<00:05:58.089> on<00:05:58.120> different<00:05:58.449> surfaces<00:05:58.659> on

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
spinning out on different surfaces on

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.680 
spinning out on different surfaces on
like<00:05:59.199> wooden<00:05:59.500> tables<00:05:59.949> on<00:06:00.330> flagged<00:06:01.330> not

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
like wooden tables on flagged not

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.550 
like wooden tables on flagged not
flagstones<00:06:02.169> on<00:06:03.599> that<00:06:04.599> table<00:06:04.839> top<00:06:05.110> surface

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
flagstones on that table top surface

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.170 
flagstones on that table top surface
that<00:06:05.680> feels<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:06.039> bit<00:06:06.159> like<00:06:06.219> marble<00:06:06.699> coming<00:06:07.089> what

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
that feels a bit like marble coming what

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.839 
that feels a bit like marble coming what
it's<00:06:07.300> called<00:06:07.479> may<00:06:08.169> even<00:06:08.349> be<00:06:08.529> marble<00:06:08.889> I'll<00:06:09.520> look

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
it's called may even be marble I'll look

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.519 
it's called may even be marble I'll look
it<00:06:09.969> up<00:06:10.060> but<00:06:10.240> I've<00:06:10.659> been<00:06:10.779> spinning<00:06:10.960> on<00:06:11.199> that<00:06:11.349> and

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
it up but I've been spinning on that and

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.070 
it up but I've been spinning on that and
you<00:06:11.589> can<00:06:11.740> see<00:06:11.919> it<00:06:12.009> scratched<00:06:12.339> up<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.759> light

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
you can see it scratched up in the light

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.809 
you can see it scratched up in the light
just<00:06:14.080> get<00:06:14.319> the<00:06:14.409> light<00:06:14.529> into<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:14.949> but<00:06:15.430> actually

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
just get the light into it but actually

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.909 
just get the light into it but actually
it<00:06:16.089> doesn't<00:06:16.270> look<00:06:16.419> too<00:06:16.659> bad<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.529> naked<00:06:17.680> eye

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
it doesn't look too bad to the naked eye

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.950 
it doesn't look too bad to the naked eye
you<00:06:17.949> can't<00:06:18.279> really<00:06:18.460> see<00:06:18.610> it<00:06:18.909> and<00:06:19.029> the<00:06:19.599> color<00:06:19.839> of

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
you can't really see it and the color of

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.200 
you can't really see it and the color of
the<00:06:20.139> plastic<00:06:20.589> isn't<00:06:21.219> just<00:06:21.490> painted<00:06:21.819> on<00:06:21.940> so

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
the plastic isn't just painted on so

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.279 
the plastic isn't just painted on so
when<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.419> scratch<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:22.719> you're<00:06:22.990> not<00:06:23.080> going<00:06:23.199> to

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
when you scratch it you're not going to

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.110 
when you scratch it you're not going to
get<00:06:23.379> like<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.770> white<00:06:24.219> line<00:06:24.460> appearing<00:06:24.969> it's

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
going to stay the same color so that's

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.579

using<00:06:40.029> a<00:06:40.389> completely

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
using a completely

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.510 
using a completely
diculous<00:06:41.199> case<00:06:41.620> and<00:06:41.800> this<00:06:41.860> does<00:06:42.099> feel<00:06:42.310> and

diculous case and this does feel and
look<00:06:42.610> really<00:06:42.970> nice<00:06:43.090> though<00:06:43.389> but<00:06:44.169> as<00:06:44.229> I<00:06:44.349> said<00:06:44.410> I

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
look really nice though but as I said I

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.809 
look really nice though but as I said I
just<00:06:44.590> wish<00:06:44.860> there<00:06:45.039> were<00:06:45.129> more<00:06:45.160> colors<00:06:45.610> and

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
just wish there were more colors and

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.070 
just wish there were more colors and
they<00:06:45.970> fix<00:06:46.270> that<00:06:46.449> little<00:06:46.569> issue<00:06:46.780> with<00:06:46.930> the

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
they fix that little issue with the

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.300 
they fix that little issue with the
flash<00:06:47.319> because<00:06:47.530> then<00:06:47.710> it<00:06:47.800> really<00:06:48.099> would<00:06:48.280> be

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
flash because then it really would be

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.300 
flash because then it really would be
probably<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.240> best<00:06:49.479> case<00:06:49.690> I've<00:06:49.900> used<00:06:50.139> so<00:06:50.800> if

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
probably the best case I've used so if

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.469 
probably the best case I've used so if
you've<00:06:51.430> got<00:06:51.460> any<00:06:51.610> questions<00:06:51.729> please<00:06:52.240> comment
