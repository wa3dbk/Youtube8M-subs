00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.880
 hi to all the friends of iphoneitalia 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.970
 as usual 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.800
 let's take a little preview 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.900
 as soon as I personally have just 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.750
 purchased the tomtom italy I wanted 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.480
 to show 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.880
 let's say a small initial video that you 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 shows the internal menu until then 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 a video test 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.030
 the application opens in a very way 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:43.540
 fast and initially shows us the map 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.129
 with the point where we are 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.140
 obviously waiting right now 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.550
 of gps signals but I'm at home then 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.899
 don't find us I have already seen a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.420
 Pochettino menus as they are formed 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 let's say there are very few settings 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.270
 just the ones we say are basic 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 we have the settings for the entry le 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.080
 settings for the map that are not 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.410
 many points of interest we can 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 attract and disable them and choose 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.160
 on the map he wants to show later 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.420
 route planning with 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.220
 possibility to activate and deactivate the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.770
 velox and the iq routes which is a function 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.799
 exclusive of tomtom that will allow us 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.229
 to plan b to always choose 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:40.210
 the best way also according to 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.980
 day and time of the week then 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.190
 we have miles and miles distance unit 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.930
 not enough we can activate and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.250
 turn off audio and night vision 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.650
 between maps 2d 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.680
 in short, the settings are the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.700
 classic of tomtom we can manage i 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 favorite points ask for a point of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.490
 interest in particular type I want 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.530
 to know near me how many and which ones 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.960
 service stations are there and he gives me 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 the entire list of those already entered by 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.470
 a manhole cover with several points 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.520
 of interest planning 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:25.070
 advanced we make a small one small 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 try then we start from address funds 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.680
 cogruzzo this is a proof that I already have 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.220
 I was doing kind of a journey it will take 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.470
 pine starting time the destination already 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.470
 the departure time was entered 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.080
 this serves precisely for the matter 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.290
 let's say before the iq routes we put 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.280
 today at four o'clock since there are 359 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.400
 plan route and in an instant it comes 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.709
 verification of the path also because much 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 very short fact and rightly him there 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.390
 always asks are you the signal if 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.130
 let 's go the route option but we can 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.800
 we make a little gem 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.800
 see turn left 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:28.440
 between 80 meters immediately to the left immediately 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 assert the graphic is slightly 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.250
 improved compared to mine for example 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.980
 tomtom one even if the speed of 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.710
 update of our position to 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.930
 beyond the gps is not very fast hides the 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.900
 fluidity is not very fluid we say 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.430
 animation in this sense 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.989
 press put in a grant that is 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.180
 such a thing is important 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.959
 so you see that the operation then 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.200
 the classic and is similar in any 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.790
 point the navigator the possibility 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.129
 we can also put it in 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.019
 horizontal and 5 there is in this there 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.909
 take each other 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.659
 by pressing the i you have information 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:17.590
 on the path options we can do the 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.880
 route options we had seen before 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.880
 and return to navigation 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:35.090
 well that's all for now at 200 meters 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.560
 turn lend options gate yes this 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.780
 that's all 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.900
 I hope to show you a video soon 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.900
 review 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.769
