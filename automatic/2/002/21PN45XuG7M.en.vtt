00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 hello I am the christian and me 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.939
 show you today the installation of the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.430
 headlights 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.570
 at the peugeot 206 i signed up for the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.379
 command decided 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 however, you can also find it on www.weg.de 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.220
 many other colors and variants 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 These seem to fit better in the old one 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.019
 model from 99 to 02 and with the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.309
 associated adapter also in the new 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.870
 model from 0 2 to 0 7 where to find the old ones 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.000
 we have to come to headlights 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.230
 remove the grill 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.269
 That's as easy as we have to 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 just loosen the four holding swabians 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.219
 and then you can use the grill carefully 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.219
 shares 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.780
 after loosening the four plastic skin 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.150
 can we screw the last two on 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.600
 remove grill and then this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.600
 waiting 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.780
 if you dismantle the grill please 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.060
 photo table because this is still with two 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.409
 great noses attached to too much 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.409
 to find violent violence 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.500
 very important in the expansion of the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.010
 headlamps is ignitions house and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.960
 light off 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.220
 then we can screw ourselves to the three 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 apparently dedicate 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.840
 pay attention to the expansion where he uses the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.319
 she lies down at the end too 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.319
 build again 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.970
 Now we can see the spotlight 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.340
 just take it out front just for that 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.340
 nor the four electricity supplier stocks 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.700
 before we seem the new ones yes 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.379
 we have to be able to agree 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.720
 Actuator for electric power 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.239
 rebuild the government 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.239
 turn this positive and take it out 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.810
 then in the new headlight the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.319
 transport lock with a pair of pliers 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.319
 remove 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.080
 and use the actuator motor 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.960
 now simply small plug again 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.960
 plug in 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.240
 we can already do the tiger 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.240
 use 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.590
 insert the grill again 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.260
 Let's have a look at the result 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.260
 on
