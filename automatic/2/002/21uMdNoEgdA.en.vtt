00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the marks of the pigeons that went

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180 
the marks of the pigeons that went
painting<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.810> painting<00:03:01.170> exactly<00:03:01.710> when<00:03:01.980> there

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
painting the painting exactly when there

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.280 
painting the painting exactly when there
is<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> new<00:03:02.580> member

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
is a new member

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.220 
is a new member
he<00:03:04.290> has<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:05.990> make<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.500> mark<00:03:07.860> yes<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.990> has<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.110> be

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
he has to make a mark yes and has to be

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.760 
he has to make a mark yes and has to be
different<00:03:10.620> logical<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.030> other<00:03:12.620> marks<00:03:13.620> of

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
different logical of the other marks of

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.620 
different logical of the other marks of
the<00:03:13.920> rest<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.340> their<00:03:14.490> owners<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.210> he<00:03:15.300> has<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the rest of their owners so he has to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.170 
the rest of their owners so he has to
show<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.930> other<00:03:16.260> owners<00:03:16.800> first<00:03:17.160> exactly

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
show the other owners first exactly

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.140 
show the other owners first exactly
before<00:03:18.570> he<00:03:18.720> exactly<00:03:19.730> because<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:20.970> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
before he exactly because there is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.570 
before he exactly because there is
impossible<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.020> pigeons<00:03:22.710> with<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.100> same<00:03:23.310> mark

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
impossible to pigeons with the same mark

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.760 
impossible to pigeons with the same mark
absolutely<00:03:23.880> different<00:03:24.450> odors<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.320> who<00:03:25.560> is

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
absolutely different odors so who is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.660 
absolutely different odors so who is
counting<00:03:26.670> how<00:03:26.820> many<00:03:26.870> minutes<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:29.070> pigeons

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
counting how many minutes the pigeons

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
counting how many minutes the pigeons
are<00:03:29.790> together<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:31.590> people<00:03:32.130> who<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:34.640> judging

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
it's amazing how he control controls all

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.130 
it's amazing how he control controls all
the<00:03:49.890> pigeons<00:03:50.100> all<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.880> marks<00:03:51.270> all<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.750> points

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
the pigeons all the marks all the points

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.870 
the pigeons all the marks all the points
I<00:03:52.640> don't<00:03:53.640> know<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.970> don't<00:03:54.360> understand<00:03:54.780> but

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
I don't know I don't understand but

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.560 
I don't know I don't understand but
everyone<00:03:56.880> trusts<00:03:57.300> him<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.860> when<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.370> say<00:03:59.670> how

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
everyone trusts him and when you say how

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.230 
everyone trusts him and when you say how
long<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.200> pigeon<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.860> with<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.220> female<00:04:02.730> do

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
long the pigeon is with the female do

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.750 
long the pigeon is with the female do
they<00:04:03.360> have<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.630> be<00:04:03.660> touching<00:04:04.250> not<00:04:05.250> touching

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
they have to be touching not touching

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.680 
they have to be touching not touching
but<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.330> an<00:04:06.600> area<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.440> may<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:08.090> 2<00:04:09.090> 3<00:04:09.390> 4

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
but in an area and it may be 2 3 4

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.460 
but in an area and it may be 2 3 4
meters<00:04:09.930> around<00:04:10.410> there<00:04:11.190> around<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.180> female<00:04:12.600> if

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
meters around there around a female if

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.479 
meters around there around a female if
it's<00:04:13.680> more<00:04:13.890> nope<00:04:14.550> no<00:04:14.880> points<00:04:15.270> no<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:16.440> also<00:04:17.070> I

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
it's more nope no points no and also I

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.440 
it's more nope no points no and also I
believe<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.989> pigeons<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:20.180> transmitters<00:04:21.180> is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
believe the pigeons have transmitters is

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.370 
believe the pigeons have transmitters is
that<00:04:21.840> right

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that right

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.100 
that right
you<00:04:22.770> know<00:04:22.919> it's<00:04:23.190> getting<00:04:23.460> quite<00:04:24.080> technical

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
you know it's getting quite technical

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.810 
you know it's getting quite technical
this<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.860> optionally<00:04:26.550> for

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
this is optionally for

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.020 
this is optionally for
samples<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.360> have<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.570> good<00:04:27.870> pigeon<00:04:28.760> Jew<00:04:29.760> don't

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
samples you have a good pigeon Jew don't

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.610 
samples you have a good pigeon Jew don't
want<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.720> lost<00:04:30.930> him

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
want to lost him

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.770 
want to lost him
it's<00:04:32.430> possible<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:34.280> put<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.780> transmission

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
it's possible to put like a transmission

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.670 
it's possible to put like a transmission
yeah<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.420> like<00:04:39.420> for<00:04:39.840> example<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.560> the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
yeah and like for example in the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.580 
yeah and like for example in the
wildlife<00:04:41.270> we<00:04:42.270> control<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.870> light<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.290> so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
wildlife we control the light on so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.930 
wildlife we control the light on so
they're<00:04:43.830> exactly<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.670> same

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
they're exactly the same

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.660 
they're exactly the same
yeah<00:04:45.210> we<00:04:45.840> put<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.230> transmission<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.250> for

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
yeah we put the transmission and for

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.440 
yeah we put the transmission and for
example<00:04:47.970> we<00:04:48.330> can't<00:04:48.980> we<00:04:49.980> lost<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.910> male<00:04:51.180> or<00:04:51.390> the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
example we can't we lost the male or the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.300 
example we can't we lost the male or the
female<00:04:51.840> because<00:04:52.500> some<00:04:52.710> females<00:04:53.100> are<00:04:53.280> very

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
female because some females are very

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.640 
female because some females are very
very<00:04:53.700> pleasures<00:04:54.120> yeah<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:55.500> can<00:04:57.200> we<00:04:58.200> can<00:04:58.410> look

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
very pleasures yeah we can we can look

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.370 
very pleasures yeah we can we can look
for<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.700> for<00:04:59.970> them<00:05:00.150> truck<00:05:00.480> with<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.840> exactly

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
for it for them truck with the exactly

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.770 
for it for them truck with the exactly
with<00:05:01.730> like<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:03.110> normal<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:05.450> Augustine<00:05:06.450> we<00:05:06.570> must

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
with like a normal and Augustine we must

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.680 
with like a normal and Augustine we must
stress<00:05:07.140> that<00:05:07.170> it<00:05:08.010> does<00:05:08.310> look<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.850> suppose<00:05:09.330> that

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
stress that it does look I suppose that

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.020 
stress that it does look I suppose that
the<00:05:10.260> female<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:11.220> being<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.730> little<00:05:11.940> bit

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the female is is being a little bit
