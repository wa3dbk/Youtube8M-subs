00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550 

okay<00:00:00.390> so<00:00:00.450> let's<00:00:00.750> show<00:00:00.930> what<00:00:00.960> it<00:00:01.260> looks<00:00:01.410> like

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
okay so let's show what it looks like

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.770 
okay so let's show what it looks like
when<00:00:01.770> there's<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> message<00:00:02.399> coming<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:03.389> for

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
when there's a message coming in so for

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.450 
when there's a message coming in so for
that<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.259> need<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.680> know<00:00:04.980> two<00:00:05.490> more<00:00:05.730> assets<00:00:07.460> we

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
that we need to know two more assets we

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.410 
that we need to know two more assets we
need<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.880> actual<00:00:09.330> speech<00:00:09.870> bubble<00:00:11.240> drag<00:00:12.240> that

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
need the actual speech bubble drag that

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.220 
need the actual speech bubble drag that
in<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.900> then<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.349> need<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.889> jet<00:00:14.490> hit<00:00:15.020> like<00:00:16.020> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
in and then we need a jet hit like that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.340 
in and then we need a jet hit like that
guy<00:00:16.470> there

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.480 

so<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.500> chatter<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.100> first<00:00:24.310> thing<00:00:24.460> that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
so the chatter is the first thing that

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.940 
so the chatter is the first thing that
should<00:00:24.760> come<00:00:24.940> in<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.360> let's<00:00:25.570> animate<00:00:26.530> him<00:00:26.830> in

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
should come in so let's animate him in

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.790 
should come in so let's animate him in
from<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.400> whoops<00:00:27.910> from<00:00:28.690> the<00:00:28.869> side<00:00:29.080> it's<00:00:29.590> this

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
from the whoops from the side it's this

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.339 
from the whoops from the side it's this
one<00:00:29.980> here<00:00:30.010> not<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.550> other<00:00:30.730> one<00:00:30.850> so<00:00:31.840> I'll<00:00:31.960> drag

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
one here not the other one so I'll drag

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:40.799 
one here not the other one so I'll drag
that<00:00:32.500> onto<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.890> layer<00:00:33.150> stack<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.550> then<00:00:40.510> place

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
that onto the layer stack and then place

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.549 
that onto the layer stack and then place
him<00:00:41.170> around<00:00:41.710> here<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:43.660> good<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:47.260> go

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
him around here that's good and then go

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.630 
him around here that's good and then go
only<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.190> few<00:00:48.370> frames<00:00:48.640> actually<00:00:49.150> not<00:00:49.390> see<00:00:50.640> three

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
only a few frames actually not see three

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.139 
only a few frames actually not see three
maybe<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.830> position<00:00:54.550> keyframe<00:00:54.730> all

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
maybe and then a position keyframe all

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.670 
maybe and then a position keyframe all
to<00:00:55.360> pee<00:00:55.540> and<00:00:56.320> go<00:00:56.530> back<00:00:56.860> and<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:58.570> okay<00:00:59.230> we<00:00:59.500> want

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
to pee and go back and see okay we want

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.520 
to pee and go back and see okay we want
him<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.010> come<00:01:00.160> in<00:01:00.250> from<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.430> side<00:01:00.700> like<00:01:00.940> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
him to come in from the side like that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580 
him to come in from the side like that
so<00:01:02.530> that's<00:01:02.890> what<00:01:03.070> he<00:01:03.130> does<00:01:03.280> I'll<00:01:03.969> even<00:01:04.210> make<00:01:04.630> it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
so that's what he does I'll even make it

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.750 
so that's what he does I'll even make it
a<00:01:05.649> bit<00:01:05.770> faster<00:01:06.220> like<00:01:07.000> that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.780 

now<00:01:10.360> when<00:01:10.570> he's<00:01:10.750> come<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:12.160> want<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
now when he's come in we want the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.170 
now when he's come in we want the
message<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.450> appear<00:01:14.050> immediately<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:15.190> drop

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
message to appear immediately so drop

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.530 
message to appear immediately so drop
that<00:01:16.420> here<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:19.410> make<00:01:20.410> it<00:01:20.620> a<00:01:20.680> bit<00:01:20.890> smaller

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that here and make it a bit smaller

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.500 
that here and make it a bit smaller
maybe<00:01:22.540> around<00:01:22.870> there

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.800 

and<00:01:29.510> then<00:01:30.380> when<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.619> when<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:31.430> scale<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.180> you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and then when I when I scale this you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.740 
and then when I when I scale this you
can<00:01:32.960> see<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.260> scales<00:01:33.640> from<00:01:34.640> middle<00:01:35.119> from<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
can see it scales from middle from the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.620 
can see it scales from middle from the
center<00:01:36.080> I<00:01:36.760> really<00:01:37.760> wanted<00:01:38.000> two<00:01:38.119> scales<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.540> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
center I really wanted two scales on the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.310 
center I really wanted two scales on the
tip<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.860> press<00:01:40.610> Y<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.979> move<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.220> anchor<00:01:44.320> point

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
tip so press Y and move the anchor point

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.510 
tip so press Y and move the anchor point
to<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.950> tip<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.340> now<00:01:46.790> when<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.090> scale<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:48.520> does

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
to the tip and now when I scale it does

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.469 
to the tip and now when I scale it does
it<00:01:49.670> this<00:01:49.820> way<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.950> go<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> few<00:01:52.159> frames<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.820> had<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
it this way I go a few frames I had a

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.300 
it this way I go a few frames I had a
few<00:01:56.479> frames<00:01:56.630> forward<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.350> that's<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:57.979> right

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
few frames forward and that's it right

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.169 
few frames forward and that's it right
here<00:01:58.899> so<00:01:59.899> I'll<00:01:59.990> press<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.820> think<00:02:01.820> I'll<00:02:01.880> need<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
here so I'll press I think I'll need to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.810 
here so I'll press I think I'll need to
animate<00:02:02.929> two<00:02:03.200> properties<00:02:03.560> here<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.700> them

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
animate two properties here one of them

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.020 
animate two properties here one of them
is<00:02:04.850> scale<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.110> I'll<00:02:06.229> press<00:02:06.410> alt<00:02:06.740> s<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
is scale so I'll press alt s and the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.630 
is scale so I'll press alt s and the
other<00:02:08.149> one<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.860> opacity<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.100> all<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.489> t<00:02:12.489> I'll<00:02:13.489> go

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
other one is opacity so all to t I'll go

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.410 
other one is opacity so all to t I'll go
to<00:02:13.790> France<00:02:14.030> back<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.489> can<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:16.880> scale

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
to France back and now I can just scale

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.259 
to France back and now I can just scale
this<00:02:17.630> one<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:18.459> now<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.519> can<00:02:19.790> change<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
this one down now I can change the

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.479 
this one down now I can change the
opacity<00:02:21.580> 20<00:02:23.620> now<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.680> animation<00:02:25.190> looks<00:02:25.280> like

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
opacity 20 now the animation looks like

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.270 
opacity 20 now the animation looks like
this<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.489> bit<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:29.239> bit<00:02:29.300> rough<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.620> let's<00:02:31.130> just

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
this so a bit a bit rough so let's just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.819 
this so a bit a bit rough so let's just
add<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:34.750> inertial<00:02:35.750> bound<00:02:35.989> script<00:02:36.380> we<00:02:36.620> used

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
add the inertial bound script we used

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.490 
add the inertial bound script we used
before<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:39.459> I'll<00:02:40.459> add<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.810> scale<00:02:42.170> for

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
before so I'll add that to the scale for

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.690 
before so I'll add that to the scale for
the<00:02:42.620> speech<00:02:43.610> bubble<00:02:44.440> I'll<00:02:45.440> alt<00:02:45.890> click<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the speech bubble I'll alt click the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.650 
the speech bubble I'll alt click the
stopwatch<00:02:47.530> paste<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> inertial<00:02:49.070> script

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
stopwatch paste in the inertial script

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.960 
stopwatch paste in the inertial script
and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.970> shouldn't<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:55.299> too<00:02:56.299> much<00:02:56.510> so

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
and then it shouldn't be too much so

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.280 
and then it shouldn't be too much so
I'll<00:02:58.970> take<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.360> I'll<00:02:59.600> copy<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.110> entire

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
I'll take this I'll copy the entire

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.940
