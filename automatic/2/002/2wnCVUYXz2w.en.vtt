attacking mid and like I said it could

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.300 
attacking mid and like I said it could
go<00:02:26.990> either<00:02:27.020> way<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.530> could<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.770> left<00:02:28.010> mid<00:02:28.160> it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
go either way it could be a left mid it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.830 
go either way it could be a left mid it
could<00:02:28.490> be<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> center<00:02:28.940> attacking<00:02:29.240> mid<00:02:29.360> breathe

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
could be a center attacking mid breathe

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.810 
could be a center attacking mid breathe
away<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.440> he<00:02:30.590> will<00:02:30.740> go<00:02:30.860> up<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.130> an<00:02:31.250> 85

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
away I think he will go up to an 85

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.490 
away I think he will go up to an 85
which<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.450> pushing<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.840> boat<00:02:32.990> out<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> big

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
which is pushing the boat out as a big

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.080 
which is pushing the boat out as a big
upgrade<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:33.950> January<00:02:34.340> especially<00:02:34.940> for

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
upgrade for January especially for

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.060 
upgrade for January especially for
someone<00:02:35.210> who's<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.540> 83<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.200> got<00:02:36.740> too<00:02:36.920> hungry

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
someone who's in 83 and got too hungry

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.430 
someone who's in 83 and got too hungry
did<00:02:37.400> last<00:02:37.580> year<00:02:37.670> from<00:02:37.910> 84<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.050> think<00:02:39.320> he's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
did last year from 84 so I do think he's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.170 
did last year from 84 so I do think he's
been<00:02:39.620> playing<00:02:39.830> better<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.610> year<00:02:40.670> than<00:02:40.850> he

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
been playing better this year than he

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.420 
been playing better this year than he
was<00:02:41.420> when<00:02:41.630> he<00:02:41.690> warranted<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.410> 84<00:02:42.980> cards<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
was when he warranted that 84 cards and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.740 
was when he warranted that 84 cards and
I<00:02:43.460> think<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:43.790> really<00:02:44.060> harsh<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.450> take<00:02:44.630> him

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I think it was really harsh to take him

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.080 
I think it was really harsh to take him
dance<00:02:44.900> at<00:02:45.110> 83<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.980> put<00:02:46.160> him<00:02:46.250> back<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.640> 84

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
dance at 83 so put him back up to the 84

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.730 
dance at 83 so put him back up to the 84
he<00:02:47.180> deserves<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.660> an<00:02:47.750> Optima<00:02:48.110> again<00:02:48.290> because

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
pattern is absolutely huge one of these

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.479 
pattern is absolutely huge one of these
guys<00:04:17.720> key<00:04:17.989> areas<00:04:18.350> is<00:04:18.500> his<00:04:18.680> pattern<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.220> also

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
guys key areas is his pattern and also

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.909 
guys key areas is his pattern and also
on<00:04:19.700> its<00:04:19.850> inform<00:04:20.270> that<00:04:20.480> any<00:04:20.810> went<00:04:20.989> from<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.320> 79<00:04:21.890> I

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.830 
on its inform that any went from a 79 I
think<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.280> an<00:04:22.370> 80<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:23.060> went<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:23.270> about<00:04:23.390> six

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
think to an 80 you went up about six

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.420 
think to an 80 you went up about six
person<00:04:24.260> or<00:04:24.350> something<00:04:24.620> like<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.400> is

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
person or something like that so it is

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.110 
person or something like that so it is
definitely

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
definitely

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.040 
definitely
definitely<00:04:26.479> going<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:26.750> going<00:04:26.870> up

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.020 
definitely going to be going up
absolutely<00:04:27.800> massive<00:04:28.100> amounts<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.729> could<00:04:28.910> even

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
absolutely massive amounts it could even

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.330 
absolutely massive amounts it could even
go<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:29.240> like<00:04:29.419> plus<00:04:29.690> 90<00:04:30.139> into<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> 82<00:04:30.860> because

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
go up like plus 90 into the 82 because

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.860 
go up like plus 90 into the 82 because
he's<00:04:31.460> look<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.790> higher<00:04:32.030> than<00:04:32.270> its<00:04:32.389> informal

he's look to higher than its informal
already<00:04:33.320> i<00:04:33.410> think<00:04:33.620> as<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:33.830> for<00:04:34.010> maybe<00:04:34.220> an<00:04:34.370> 80

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
already i think as in for maybe an 80

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.890 
already i think as in for maybe an 80
we're<00:04:34.699> actually<00:04:34.820> i'm<00:04:35.000> not<00:04:35.150> sure<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.510> even

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
we're actually i'm not sure but even

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.360 
we're actually i'm not sure but even
still<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.199> is<00:04:36.290> going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> be<00:04:36.560> going<00:04:36.770> up<00:04:36.860> huge

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
still it is going to be going up huge

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.490 
still it is going to be going up huge
huge<00:04:37.699> amounts<00:04:38.060> dribbling<00:04:38.660> plus<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:39.080> defend

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
huge amounts dribbling plus to defend

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.170 
huge amounts dribbling plus to defend
them<00:04:39.650> plus<00:04:39.860> three<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.100> physical<00:04:40.639> only<00:04:40.940> plus

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
them plus three and physical only plus

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.330 
them plus three and physical only plus
one<00:04:41.449> makes<00:04:41.960> him<00:04:42.169> an<00:04:42.320> absolutely<00:04:42.949> brilliant

one makes him an absolutely brilliant
card<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:43.940> probably<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.449> best<00:04:44.720> right<00:04:45.050> back<00:04:45.229> in

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410

card and probably the best right back in
the<00:04:45.590> BBVA<00:04:45.889> like<00:04:46.250> i<00:04:46.340> was<00:04:46.460> saying<00:04:46.580> everyone<00:04:47.240> goes

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
the BBVA like i was saying everyone goes

the BBVA like i was saying everyone goes
for<00:04:47.570> Daniel<00:04:47.870> wise<00:04:48.020> at<00:04:48.139> the<00:04:48.260> moment<00:04:48.590> because<00:04:48.800> of

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
for Daniel wise at the moment because of

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:49.990 
for Daniel wise at the moment because of
his<00:04:49.010> pace<00:04:49.190> but<00:04:49.400> i<00:04:49.460> think<00:04:49.639> i'd<00:04:49.760> be<00:04:49.850> more

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.219 
his pace but i think i'd be more
inclined<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.479> go<00:04:50.570> for<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.810> guy<00:04:50.960> with<00:04:51.139> the
