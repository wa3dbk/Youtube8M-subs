00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
the wall she decision really was like a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.510 
the wall she decision really was like a
long<00:00:59.300> time<00:00:59.480> coming<00:00:59.510> like<00:01:00.020> things<00:01:00.710> not

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
long time coming like things not

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.060

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.890 
though so bad that couldn't be worked
through<00:01:37.460> we<00:01:37.820> weren't<00:01:38.000> getting<00:01:38.090> along<00:01:38.240> as<00:01:38.600> well

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
through we weren't getting along as well

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.929 
through we weren't getting along as well
outside<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.380> games<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:39.770> used<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.400> then

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
outside the games we used to and then

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.810 
outside the games we used to and then
that<00:01:41.119> was<00:01:41.210> affecting<00:01:41.600> our<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.869> game<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.820> none

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that was affecting our in game and none

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.140 
that was affecting our in game and none
of<00:01:43.850> us<00:01:43.970> were<00:01:44.090> playing<00:01:44.330> well

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
of us were playing well

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.170 
of us were playing well
and<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.660> one<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.930> practice<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.640> think

sucks that had to be Dave be go but we

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.680 
sucks that had to be Dave be go but we
just<00:01:53.220> felt<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.610> would<00:01:53.820> bring<00:01:54.360> our<00:01:54.510> team

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
just felt like that would bring our team

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.060 
just felt like that would bring our team
closer<00:01:54.930> together<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.040> shoes<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.730> mean<00:01:58.070> if

away from home away from my family for

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
away from home away from my family for

my friends you know girlfriend here and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.130 
my friends you know girlfriend here and
there<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.820> felt<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.600> lot<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> times<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
there I felt like a lot of times of

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
there I felt like a lot of times of
making<00:02:28.410> some<00:02:28.590> sacrifices<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.640> weren't

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
making some sacrifices that they weren't

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.510 
making some sacrifices that they weren't
making<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.709> they<00:02:31.800> also<00:02:31.950> felt<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
making I think they also felt like that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.890 
making I think they also felt like that
we<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.820> put<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> same<00:02:33.270> lot<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> work<00:02:33.660> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
we all put the same lot of work and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.930 
we all put the same lot of work and
maybe<00:02:34.560> they<00:02:34.740> didn't<00:02:34.920> get<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> same<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
maybe they didn't get the same out of it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.699 
maybe they didn't get the same out of it
even<00:02:36.390> though<00:02:36.600> well<00:02:36.840> she's<00:02:36.990> captain<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.560> his

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
even though well she's captain like his

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.440 
even though well she's captain like his
maker<00:02:37.950> strats<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.520> stuff<00:02:38.820> or<00:02:39.090> stuff<00:02:39.360> like

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
maker strats and stuff or stuff like

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.850 
maker strats and stuff or stuff like
that<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.900> think<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.290> kind<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.530> had<00:02:40.650> stuff

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that like I think that kind of had stuff

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.830 
that like I think that kind of had stuff
to<00:02:40.980> do<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:41.730> never<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.360> bar

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.029 
like just went straight from you
thinking<00:04:41.150> about<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.660> that<00:04:42.380> happening<00:04:42.860> I

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
thinking about it to that happening I

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.400 
thinking about it to that happening I
just<00:04:43.699> figured<00:04:44.270> we'd<00:04:44.449> talk<00:04:44.690> about<00:04:44.720> it<00:04:44.990> before

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
just figured we'd talk about it before

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.080 
just figured we'd talk about it before
ants<00:04:45.560> or<00:04:45.770> anything<00:04:46.010> happened<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.580> that's

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
ants or anything happened that's that's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.190 
ants or anything happened that's that's
one<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.330> main<00:04:47.419> things<00:04:47.449> like<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> seven-man

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
one of the main things like a seven-man

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.170 
one of the main things like a seven-man
about<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.530> how<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.740> was<00:04:48.830> handled<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.970> run

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
about was how it was handled the run

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.060 
about was how it was handled the run
that<00:04:50.300> we<00:04:50.450> had<00:04:50.660> is<00:04:50.870> will<00:04:51.200> be<00:04:51.349> unparalleled

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
that we had is will be unparalleled

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.659 
that we had is will be unparalleled
through<00:04:53.349> probably<00:04:54.349> like<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.010> history<00:04:55.639> of

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
through probably like the history of

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.300 
through probably like the history of
like<00:04:55.880> MLG
