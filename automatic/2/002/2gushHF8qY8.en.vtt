 the hatchback was unusually sloping back 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.609
 part of the body with opening the rear

 63 horsepower volume is small 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.719
 the fact that the motor is located along the front 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.479
 it is a five-speed box

 plenty of space though outside this box 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.880
 it seems a cramped plastic torpedo with 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.759
 big shelf for every little thing
