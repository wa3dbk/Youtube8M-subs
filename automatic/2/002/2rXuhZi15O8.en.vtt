00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.500
 and equal to all here will of networks 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 comments I bring you white gameplay 2 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.090
 and as you are unjustly watching kill 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.120
 at the beginning and the following is already a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 ratita with the shotgun since the truth 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.769
 is that I do not know the lately it starts to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.749
 look what I have saved and that is 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.909
 practically all are with those with 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.980
 shotguns is not that I like one another 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.829
 but practically I just like 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.449
 all and just play with them in the 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.759
 moment that I saw a map that could be 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.229
 more or less playable either this one or 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.750
 abc in the background even play it for the 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:36.210
 still I put myself to play as 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 as I say the map were have no 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 I sense to take them complete because even so 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 I carry it and I do not know the truth is that the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 I'm counting super fun will kick 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.839
 less to the best than from the one who played 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.960
 from warfare2 a life a shotgun 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.309
 decent because let's say that those of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 lacoste 1 if it is true that he used them 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.079
 but not that they were as good as 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.999
 for example in this game and I think that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 at this moment it has been made them 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.539
 perfect to the best is that after playing 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 to refer 3 mode that the shotguns will 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.100
 will be a pity the truth because trees 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 job now is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 for those weapons I find them better in the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 case is that if you notice and you give 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.380
 account for example games like local 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.570
 3 or any previous known 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 perhaps removing the white what is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 has achieved so much in whites 1 with 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.619
 targets 2 is that there are no good weapons and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.690
 bad that is to say there are weapons that are better 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 but there are no weapons that are bad 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.649
 Lousy you are thinking right now I 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 that is the execution for example as 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.190
 oyster gun so close up kill kills 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.479
 of a shot because it 's like a shotgun 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.369
 you know that they work by chargers and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.130
 others I put the best you think I know the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.020
 suat that is the worst rifle is high 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.149
 but then you think about it and for example in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.970
 the latter in jartÃºm update have 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.380
 improved the suat and now it's really 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.240
 let's say it kills pretty I have a couple 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
 of lenses with the suat and as I say 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
 oysters then kill quite then 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.190
 let's say I started thinking weapons and in 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 classes and so on and all that and really and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.200
 many less bad weapons said the put 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.030
 to think I know in modern warfare 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.580
 3 with our panel in the known 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.020
 earlier that there were well weapons that did not 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.060
 we played with a stick that said this 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.039
 Please ie can it be that this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.900
 sister put in this game no 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.250
 weapons that were totally useless and not 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.420
 it made no sense in the game because 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.840
 actually used and had been 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.000
 worried either the people of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 activision and infinity ward never 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.900
 they had worried about improving them or anything 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.329
 for the style then well let's say that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.879
 has been more or less my balance after 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.230
 to see that you can practically take out 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.760
 examples with all the weapons with this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.370
 game 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.049
 with weapons like with the knife that has 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.659
 the world of the knife written the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.040
 companies dabbling with the gun with 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.769
 the snipers that pretty much are 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.980
 they are all good 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.079
 let's say I do not know I do not know that many 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.640
 let's say we forget very 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.310
 it is quickly what happens to us that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.290
 we quickly forget then the bad and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 For example, we will not remember how 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.769
 warfare 3 but the gourd 3 like 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 comparison or better with with white to 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.730
 weapon level and a thousand and things as 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 better of the low gusts that do not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.879
 they were as balanced as in this 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.760
 I do not know, there's a thousand and one thing 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.319
 personally I liked more about this game 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.349
 more than anything because they give it a thousand times more 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.389
 of variety things that I think are missing 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.150
 to this to this game after takeoff 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.430
 enough time I think it's missing you 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.049
 you can paint the face as in the with the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.049
 white is one that you could paint 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.970
 let's say that the face of different with the 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.129
 French who had to paint his face 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.709
 and other good maybe they put it in a 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.180
 pack these micropayments or whatever 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.240
 that you can paint your face or paint yourself 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.510
 or make you say that another type of 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.520
 how to say another type of costumes that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.980
 you can take me I would love it to be 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.790
 that there were people with different 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.680
 different costumes maybe that's what 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.940
 we will wait to see in other colors and 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.290
 following but knowing that they have 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.200
 started to put in we do not look for flashes 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.060
 it may be that they put other forms of 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.190
 customize it but good the case the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.140
 air comet and call I love you sincerely 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.210
 I would not know what to stay because better 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.250
 use the s12 and I love that 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.190
 let's put to use this shotgun 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.710
 love to use by la caixa and follow me 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.320
 enchanting and I little use the m 12 16 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.600
 If I see that it's garbage 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.220
 in yesterday's video that was not so bad 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.350
 that I had to try it with a long 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.840
 and with grips if I'm not wrong or 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.250
 laser sight in this case is that good 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.620
 trying to get me the golden day though 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.720
 really for the moment that starts me 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.400
 to get the gold ones and I see some challenges 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.870
 that it will be better to give it a kill shot of a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.450
 shot and so on it gets pretty 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.460
 heavy but here you have the underlines 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.640
 I had a run of the best of I do not know 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.020
 exactly 26 or 27 casualties a little more 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.000
 started to get a nuclear that a 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.300
 escopetilla but well I recorded this 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.040
 before I was not commenting on anything 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.510
 when it has been calmer and 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.610
 and in fact I had the streaks that are 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.550
 as to kill quotes down 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.840
 confirmed that we say that it does not have 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.790
 nothing to do with the mouse that I already 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.140
 Finish is already finished like this thanks to 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.060
 liked the video vote what I like 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.640
 favorites does not come very close all 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.640
 media that is compatible I have the most
