this<00:03:09.810> actually<00:03:09.959> talks<00:03:10.349> about<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.829> current

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
this actually talks about the current

this actually talks about the current

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
very nice camera is a 2 gigabyte card

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.629 
very nice camera is a 2 gigabyte card
and<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.500> I've<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.430> taken<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.970> few

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
and I think I've just taken a few

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:31.129 
and I think I've just taken a few
pictures<00:03:28.549> will<00:03:29.549> fit<00:03:30.150> don't<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.959> see

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
pictures will fit don't if you can see

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.610 
pictures will fit don't if you can see
that<00:03:31.349> if<00:03:32.099> we're<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.489> full<00:03:32.849> resolution<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.840> JPEG

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that if we're on full resolution a JPEG

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.550 
that if we're on full resolution a JPEG
and<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.889> will<00:03:35.010> fit<00:03:35.480> 521<00:03:36.480> pictures<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.959> 20-day

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and it will fit 521 pictures the 20-day

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.059 
and it will fit 521 pictures the 20-day
although<00:03:41.099> not<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.310> newest<00:03:41.730> camera<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:43.069> very

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
although not the newest camera is a very

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.920 
although not the newest camera is a very
very<00:03:44.250> fast<00:03:44.609> camera<00:03:47.299> it's<00:03:49.819> it's<00:03:50.819> as<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.540> fast<00:03:51.780> as

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
very fast camera it's it's as as fast as

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.699 
very fast camera it's it's as as fast as
you<00:03:52.019> want<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.349> look<00:03:52.560> my<00:03:52.769> finger<00:03:53.069> there<00:03:53.220> look

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.569 

five<00:03:58.709> frames<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.250> second<00:03:59.690> but<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:01.579> and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
five frames a second but with it and

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.210 
five frames a second but with it and
basically<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.630> wakes<00:04:03.959> up<00:04:04.169> quickly<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.950> put<00:04:05.130> it

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
basically it wakes up quickly you put it

marks on it I don't know but view around
it<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.880> can<00:04:49.910> see<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:55.250> lens<00:04:55.430> incidentally<00:04:56.150> is

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
it you can see the lens incidentally is

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.930 
it you can see the lens incidentally is
a<00:04:56.300> little<00:04:56.990> bit<00:04:57.110> faster<00:04:57.320> than<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.950> kit<00:04:58.700> lens

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
a little bit faster than the kit lens

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.000 
a little bit faster than the kit lens
that<00:04:59.090> would<00:04:59.300> have<00:04:59.420> come<00:04:59.570> with<00:04:59.750> this<00:05:00.820> being<00:05:01.820> a

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
f-35 to four or five so a little bit

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.930 
f-35 to four or five so a little bit
better<00:05:05.570> in<00:05:05.750> low<00:05:05.870> light<00:05:05.900> than<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:07.690> kit<00:05:08.690> lens

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
better in low light than the kit lens

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.310 
better in low light than the kit lens
probably<00:05:10.940> some<00:05:11.090> fingernail<00:05:11.720> marks<00:05:11.750> there

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
probably some fingernail marks there

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.550 
probably some fingernail marks there
where<00:05:12.590> people<00:05:12.620> grab<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.310> grip<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:14.560> fingers

touch<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:22.190> camera<00:05:22.580> actually<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:22.910> am<00:05:23.300> I<00:05:23.690> took

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
touch this camera actually I am I took

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.730 
touch this camera actually I am I took
in<00:05:24.320> payments<00:05:24.710> or<00:05:24.770> some<00:05:24.920> work<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:26.530> did<00:05:27.530> for<00:05:27.710> a

have a 20 day a 40 day on five day and I

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.930 
have a 20 day a 40 day on five day and I
can<00:05:35.180> honestly<00:05:35.330> say<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:36.580> blowing<00:05:37.580> up<00:05:37.670> large

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
can honestly say it blowing up large

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.430 
can honestly say it blowing up large
