about<00:02:21.050> I'd<00:02:21.710> say<00:02:21.950> about<00:02:22.040> an<00:02:22.250> inch<00:02:22.430> high<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
about I'd say about an inch high and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.740 
about I'd say about an inch high and
this<00:02:24.200> raises<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.160> about<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.640> guess<00:02:26.180> an<00:02:26.480> inch

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
this raises it up about I guess an inch

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.890 
this raises it up about I guess an inch
and<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.380> quarter<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.950> an<00:02:28.160> inch<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.520> half<00:02:28.900> I've

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
and a quarter to an inch and a half I've

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.990 
and a quarter to an inch and a half I've
measured<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:30.680> sits<00:02:31.310> high<00:02:31.430> enough<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:31.910> it

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
measured it but sits high enough for it

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.870 
measured it but sits high enough for it
to<00:02:32.030> clear<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:33.590> area<00:02:33.830> right<00:02:34.130> here<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.640> don't

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.650 
know what you can see it but if you
don't<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.360> space<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:40.490> spacer<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.240> I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
don't have that space the spacer and I

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.440 
don't have that space the spacer and I
guess<00:02:42.320> raise<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.710> up<00:02:43.040> then<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.120> part<00:02:44.390> right

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
guess raise it up then this part right

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.260 
guess raise it up then this part right
here<00:02:44.780> will<00:02:44.960> be<00:02:45.430> sitting<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.550> top<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.030> hole

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
here will be sitting on top of the hole

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.550 
here will be sitting on top of the hole
and<00:02:48.850> back<00:02:49.850> here<00:02:50.300> it's<00:02:51.200> not<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.500> be

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
and back here it's not going to be

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.820 
and back here it's not going to be
sitting<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.890> anything<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.590> have

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
sitting on anything so you have to have

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.690 
sitting on anything so you have to have
some<00:02:55.310> sort<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.640> mounting<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.950> guess<00:02:57.950> plate<00:02:58.520> or

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
some sort of mounting I guess plate or

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.580 
some sort of mounting I guess plate or
whatever<00:02:58.970> or<00:02:59.240> in<00:02:59.900> other<00:03:00.080> words<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.290> use<00:03:00.470> of

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
whatever or in other words I use of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.730 
whatever or in other words I use of
these<00:03:01.450> guess<00:03:02.450> that's<00:03:02.630> why<00:03:02.750> these<00:03:02.810> people<00:03:03.290> use

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
these guess that's why these people use

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.870 
these guess that's why these people use
foam<00:03:04.070> blocks<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.670> two<00:03:05.120> by<00:03:05.270> fours<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.920> is

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
foam blocks and two by fours but this is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.730 
foam blocks and two by fours but this is
a<00:03:07.940> much<00:03:08.210> cleaner<00:03:08.540> installation<00:03:09.410> because

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
a much cleaner installation because

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.430 
a much cleaner installation because
there's<00:03:10.040> no<00:03:10.660> bolting<00:03:11.660> down<00:03:11.690> there's<00:03:12.260> no

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
there's no bolting down there's no

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920 
there's no bolting down there's no
nothing<00:03:12.770> well<00:03:13.760> as<00:03:13.940> far<00:03:14.120> as<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.300> seat<00:03:14.510> goes<00:03:14.540> but

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
nothing well as far as the seat goes but

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.110 
nothing well as far as the seat goes but
the<00:03:15.620> mountain<00:03:15.980> saw<00:03:16.430> was<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.790> be<00:03:16.910> there

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the mountain saw was going to be there

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.400 
the mountain saw was going to be there
except<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.959> bolted<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.650> down<00:03:18.800> with<00:03:19.480> these<00:03:20.480> signs

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
except I bolted it down with these signs

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.740 
except I bolted it down with these signs

little hardware force washer on the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.949 
little hardware force washer on the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
bottom so that it'll keep it from

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.810 
bottom so that it'll keep it from
pulling<00:03:27.200> up<00:03:27.940> um<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:30.880> friend<00:03:31.880> of<00:03:31.940> mine<00:03:32.030> asked<00:03:32.390> if

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
pulling up um a friend of mine asked if

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.250 
pulling up um a friend of mine asked if
it's<00:03:34.820> sturdy<00:03:35.239> enough<00:03:35.360> over<00:03:35.900> here<00:03:36.050> if<00:03:36.110> it'll

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
it's sturdy enough over here if it'll

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.040 
it's sturdy enough over here if it'll
dent<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.880> um<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:38.120> don't<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.750> would

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
dent it um I don't think it would

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.350 
dent it um I don't think it would
because<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:40.430> pretty<00:03:40.610> close<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.850> discover

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
because it's pretty close to discover

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.080 
because it's pretty close to discover
whole<00:03:41.540> area<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.459> really<00:03:43.459> thick<00:03:43.820> in<00:03:43.850> this

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
whole area and it's really thick in this

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.410 
whole area and it's really thick in this
and<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.170> part<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.769> hole<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.580> think

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
and this part of the hole so I think

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.199 
and this part of the hole so I think
it'll<00:03:47.600> work<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.840> fine<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:51.940> snap<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.090> on

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
it'll work just fine you just snap it on

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.670 
it'll work just fine you just snap it on
there<00:03:54.370> anywhere<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:57.340> front
