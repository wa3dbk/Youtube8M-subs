because you can get it cheap you can get
a<00:00:57.120> cheaper<00:00:57.539> dehydrator<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.980> what's<00:00:59.190> really

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a cheaper dehydrator but what's really

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
a cheaper dehydrator but what's really
awesome<00:00:59.550> about<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> don't<00:01:01.199> need

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
awesome about this one is you don't need

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.520 
awesome about this one is you don't need
to<00:01:01.500> rotate<00:01:01.739> your<00:01:02.129> trays<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.870> comes<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.350> eight

few<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.939> I'll<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.689> how<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
few on there so I'll get to see how this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.950 
few on there so I'll get to see how this
dehydrator<00:02:07.439> holds<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.310> with<00:02:09.000> 16<00:02:09.570> trays

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
dehydrator holds up with 16 trays

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.110 
dehydrator holds up with 16 trays
whereas<00:02:10.770> before<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> only

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
whereas before I only

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.339 
whereas before I only
eight<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.690> time<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.909> I<00:02:15.750> didn't<00:02:16.049> have<00:02:16.170> any

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.920 
not
and<00:04:28.639> right<00:04:28.850> now<00:04:29.000> I'm<00:04:29.150> separating<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> ones

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
and right now I'm separating the ones

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.590 
and right now I'm separating the ones
that<00:04:30.139> are<00:04:30.410> from<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.040> ones<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.370> are<00:04:31.460> not

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
that are from the ones that are not

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.270 
that are from the ones that are not
which<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.780> easy<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.260> do<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.590> just<00:04:33.800> feel<00:04:34.070> it

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
which it's easy to do you just feel it

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.250 
which it's easy to do you just feel it
and<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.700> feels<00:04:34.880> squishy<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.960> done

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
and if it feels squishy it's not done

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.510 
and if it feels squishy it's not done
and<00:04:37.010> if<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.340> feels<00:04:37.550> firm<00:04:38.480> sign<00:04:39.260> one<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:40.250> one's

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
and if it feels firm sign one this one's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.060 
and if it feels firm sign one this one's
firm<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.240> finished<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.620> just<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.950> to

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
firm it's finished so you just have to

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.170 
firm it's finished so you just have to
make<00:04:43.220> sure<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.580> all<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.030> moisture
