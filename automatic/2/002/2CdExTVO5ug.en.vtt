you're doing eating walking taking
supplements<00:01:46.930> drugs<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.530> doesn't<00:01:47.800> matter<00:01:47.980> you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
still have to make a risk of benefit

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.730 
still have to make a risk of benefit
assessment<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.250> what<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.210> risk

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
assessment that is what is the risk

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.590 
assessment that is what is the risk
related<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.010> benefit<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.760> if<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> risk

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
related to the benefit is if the risk

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.990 
related to the benefit is if the risk
obviously<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.170> minimal<00:01:56.620> or<00:01:56.820> acceptable<00:01:57.820> and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
obviously is minimal or acceptable and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.180 
obviously is minimal or acceptable and
the<00:01:58.540> benefits<00:01:58.930> are<00:01:59.020> high<00:01:59.140> then<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.650> know<00:02:00.130> you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
the benefits are high then you know you

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.640 
the benefits are high then you know you
do<00:02:00.460> whatever<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:00.909> you're<00:02:01.030> going<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.240> do<00:02:01.650> and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
do whatever it is you're going to do and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.830 
do whatever it is you're going to do and
again<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.940> is<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.150> bit<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.600> can<00:02:04.750> be

topic here you get the gist so the risks

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.259 
topic here you get the gist so the risks
of<00:02:11.379> creatine<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.280> healthy<00:02:12.760> people<00:02:13.090> are

of creatine and healthy people are

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.050 
of creatine and healthy people are
phenomenally<00:02:14.049> low<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.939> non-existent<00:02:15.939> but

phenomenally low if non-existent but

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.429 
phenomenally low if non-existent but
let's<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.389> can't<00:02:16.599> say<00:02:16.749> it's<00:02:16.900> zero<00:02:17.200> because

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
let's we can't say it's zero because

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.089 
let's we can't say it's zero because
nothing<00:02:17.709> is

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
nothing is

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.429

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
know die from something strange so let's

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.880 
know die from something strange so let's
just<00:02:25.209> go<00:02:25.329> with<00:02:25.359> that<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:26.019> what<00:02:26.469> you<00:02:26.560> don't<00:02:26.739> see

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
just go with that but what you don't see

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.080 
just go with that but what you don't see
a<00:02:27.069> lot<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.450> which<00:02:28.450> always<00:02:28.659> baffles<00:02:29.230> me<00:02:29.409> in<00:02:29.590> the

interestingly I mean I often will say to
people<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:46.120> think<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.049> health<00:02:47.439> benefits<00:02:47.950> are

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
creatine are actually more compelling

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.940 
creatine are actually more compelling
than<00:02:52.090> its<00:02:52.359> performance<00:02:52.870> benefits<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.470> I've

a<00:03:58.599> couple<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:58.930> small<00:03:59.290> quick<00:04:00.190> issues<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
a couple of small quick issues of the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.259 
a couple of small quick issues of the
possible<00:04:01.750> benefits<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.290> creatine<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:03.269> again

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
possible benefits of creatine so again

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.470 
possible benefits of creatine so again
the<00:04:04.690> side<00:04:05.049> effects<00:04:05.409> honestly<00:04:06.099> are<00:04:06.400> I'm<00:04:07.060> going

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
the side effects honestly are I'm going

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.110 
the side effects honestly are I'm going
to<00:04:07.540> say<00:04:07.690> minimal<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.680> fair<00:04:09.159> but<00:04:10.090> I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
to say minimal just to be fair but I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.149 
to say minimal just to be fair but I
honestly<00:04:10.269> want<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.810> say<00:04:11.069> non-existent<00:04:12.069> but

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
honestly want to say non-existent but

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.399 
honestly want to say non-existent but
I'm<00:04:12.250> going<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.400> say<00:04:12.579> minimal<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.840> fair<00:04:14.140> and

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
I'm going to say minimal to be fair and

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.250 
I'm going to say minimal to be fair and
the<00:04:15.099> possible<00:04:15.760> benefits<00:04:16.269> clearly<00:04:16.720> outweigh

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the possible benefits clearly outweigh

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.490 
the possible benefits clearly outweigh
the<00:04:17.620> minimal<00:04:18.010> risks<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.579> really<00:04:18.880> wish<00:04:19.000> more

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
the minimal risks and I really wish more

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.840 
the minimal risks and I really wish more
medical<00:04:20.500> professional<00:04:21.070> scientists<00:04:21.669> would

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
medical professional scientists would

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.580 
medical professional scientists would
look<00:04:22.030> into<00:04:22.210> this<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.600> wish<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:23.229> course<00:04:23.290> the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
look into this I wish of course the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.320 
look into this I wish of course the
media<00:04:23.770> would<00:04:24.490> spend<00:04:24.699> a<00:04:24.790> little<00:04:24.880> more<00:04:25.120> time

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
media would spend a little more time

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.400 
media would spend a little more time
looking<00:04:25.630> into<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.110> again<00:04:26.229> we<00:04:26.289> are

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
looking into that and again we are

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.080 
looking into that and again we are
talking<00:04:26.740> about<00:04:26.830> creatine<00:04:27.100> monohydrate<00:04:27.550> here

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
talking about creatine monohydrate here

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.270 
talking about creatine monohydrate here
no<00:04:28.570> other<00:04:28.750> form<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.169> creatine<00:04:29.440> at<00:04:29.800> this<00:04:30.010> time

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
no other form of creatine at this time

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.520 
no other form of creatine at this time
so<00:04:30.910> make<00:04:31.479> sure<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:31.810> stick<00:04:32.139> that<00:04:32.260> in<00:04:32.440> your

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
so make sure that stick that in your

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.340 
so make sure that stick that in your
brain<00:04:33.030> until<00:04:34.030> we<00:04:34.210> ever<00:04:34.360> get<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.720> other<00:04:34.960> forms

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
brain until we ever get to other forms

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.620 
brain until we ever get to other forms
of<00:04:35.440> creatine<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.400> that's<00:04:36.850> my<00:04:37.030> quick<00:04:37.240> lecture

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
of creatine so that's my quick lecture

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.320 
of creatine so that's my quick lecture
of<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> day<00:04:38.080> talking<00:04:38.470> about<00:04:39.150> risk<00:04:40.150> of

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
of the day talking about risk of

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.270 
of the day talking about risk of
creatine<00:04:40.630> versus<00:04:41.229> benefits<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.830> creatine<00:04:42.039> so

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
creatine versus benefits of creatine so

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.370 
creatine versus benefits of creatine so
