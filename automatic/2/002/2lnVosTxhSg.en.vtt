00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.510
 at 2 am I'm air comet and if I eat ya 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.450
 I promised the previous video we are going to do 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:11.179
 a tutorial of the glitch of snacks and not 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.709
 of the snake in black ops that is not 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.509
 patched for nothing what we carry is 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.039
 any class I would recommend a 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.380
 light compressor to accentuate yet 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.720
 more this clichÃ© and if and if you go to 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.189
 practice a spy camera would you come 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.839
 of pearls is worth we have to do 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.339
 requirements first if you have the 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.710
 tactical configuration as it happens to me 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.129
 me not to crouch with the joystick 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.320
 esther stabbing you have to change the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.949
 default so that crouch 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.199
 be the circle or candle button xbox is very 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.109
 simple is worth once we have done 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.629
 this as the ritz is only seen in third 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.609
 person is more if from your camera 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.649
 not knowing if you're going to practice is pretty 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.570
 I recommend a spy camera that you can 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.780
 see you in the third person 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.449
 perfect hello is worth seeing camera and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.949
 so you know if it is going well or wrong 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.780
 Ok now I'm going to put the buttons 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.930
 there on one side so you can see it well 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.030
 clearly because if it's not a mess that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.659
 we need now a little sense of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.600
 rhythm is worth the trick is based on doing 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.310
 think the game that we are lying 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.290
 but we're going at this speed not the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.740
 normal speed how do we do this 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 we have to give it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.420
 circle ok keep the circle pressed 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 now I'm not doing it and then not 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 very very fast circle xx ok but no 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280
 it has left me now now you will see as yes 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.990
 what will I recommend? 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 expose as you see now from the little corner 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.909
 the middle finger is to enjoy in the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 duck button and index finger on 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 the X and with the thumb we will move 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.270
 our joystick from one side to another 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 then circle xx circle xx cycle xx 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 rest circle xx circle xx century xx 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.190
 XX century the camera 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 attentive to rhythm xx century no circle xx 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.370
 no twentieth century letting go if it's not going to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.630
 leave if this happens to you 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.910
 skip if you skip the tombs is wrong 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.820
 it has to be that he bends down and gets up 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.370
 the character worth is very very easy to 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.740
 to do is very very light so to speak 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.960
 you can not if you get this is already wrong 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.370
 and if you get this too then very 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.060
 easy to know 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.480
 now more German and in that twentieth century there 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.510
 I serve xx century xx circle xx to me 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.440
 remember a horse 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.800
 hear 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.870
 It is very simple once we know how to do 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 this can happen, it does it in a way 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 a little more complicated but that is more 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.100
 recommendable this is the game with the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.670
 same thumb 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.560
 you give yourself no 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.410
 how would it be the way a little more 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.569
 usual and at any time you can 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.569
 spin a lot 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.409
 and well we have the glitch done for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.560
 Any doubt you already know that you have me 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.310
 my 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.170
 but remember, do not put me in the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.420
 comments is that I do not get out we do not look 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.520
 a little video and especially the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.790
 agreed rhythm this cycle xx and if not 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.220
 it comes out as I say the heart and the index 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.160
 well in this way then I would go out to 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.680
 this people would see you so you could go 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.880
 walking around here then even 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 shoot at you will see the camera 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.750
 it's something like you shoot 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.700
 from above is a little bit bryant 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.330
 but the good thing is that by the way 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.990
 you can not sprint if you are 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.090
 is fuck bridge then you have the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.930
 lecce done you have here the buttons 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.910
 remember XX century XX century cycle XX 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.280
 cycle xx is very the most important thing of 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.420
 this good only everyone here fits the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 partner is not only but it is worth here what 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.550
 will be seeing and will be freaking good 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.420
 Anyway, nothing ends here 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.220
 video and the usual like and favorites 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.230
 for it to spread, I think it's the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.790
 first tutorial in Spanish that I see and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.790
 nothing alone all and goodbye
