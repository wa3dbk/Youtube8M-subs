show you one thing on air and we shipped

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.410 
show you one thing on air and we shipped
you<00:02:37.980> something<00:02:38.340> else<00:02:38.580> our<00:02:38.700> quality<00:02:39.210> control

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you something else our quality control

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
you something else our quality control
very<00:02:40.230> tight<00:02:40.500> very<00:02:40.860> very<00:02:41.100> tight

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
very tight very very tight

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.240 
very tight very very tight
I<00:02:41.610> look<00:02:41.970> at<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> range<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> stones<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
I look at a range of all the stones so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.040 
I look at a range of all the stones so
like<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.730> ring<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.630> have<00:02:45.780> seen<00:02:46.020> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
like for this ring I would have seen a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.100 
like for this ring I would have seen a
range<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.830> morganite<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:48.030> has<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.810> tight

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
range of morganite it has to be so tight

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.040 
range of morganite it has to be so tight
that<00:02:49.440> when<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.160> get<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.460> home<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.750> could<00:02:51.930> be

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that when you get at home you could be

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.200 
that when you get at home you could be
at<00:02:52.140> either<00:02:52.650> end<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.610> happy<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.060> see

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
at either end of it and be happy and see

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.440 
at either end of it and be happy and see
exactly<00:02:54.510> what<00:02:54.750> you're<00:02:54.900> getting<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.240> all

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
exactly what you're getting you see all

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.780 
exactly what you're getting you see all
first<00:02:57.780> samples<00:02:58.260> for<00:02:58.350> all<00:02:58.500> sources<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.580> go

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
first samples for all sources to go

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.660 
first samples for all sources to go
through<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.800> that's<00:03:01.800> that's<00:03:02.220> pretty<00:03:02.490> that's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
through you that's that's pretty that's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
through you that's that's pretty that's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
a big job there that's a big job and for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.500 
a big job there that's a big job and for
every<00:03:04.860> ring<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> ring<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.240> they

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
every ring like a ring like this they

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.840 
every ring like a ring like this they
have<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.720> supply<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.830> morganite<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.460> gie<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
have to supply the morganite to gie a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.410 
have to supply the morganite to gie a
and<00:03:09.240> also<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> sample<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.230> diamonds<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:11.130> be

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and also a sample the diamonds to be

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.940 
and also a sample the diamonds to be
surveyed<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.630> make<00:03:12.780> sure<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.170> yes<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.800> is

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
surveyed to make sure that yes it is

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
surveyed to make sure that yes it is
genuine<00:03:14.400> morganite<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.880> yes<00:03:15.360> these<00:03:15.600> are

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
genuine morganite and yes these are

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.320 
genuine morganite and yes these are
genuine<00:03:16.260> diamonds<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.370> comes<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.640> me<00:03:17.760> and

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
genuine diamonds then it comes to me and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.180 
genuine diamonds then it comes to me and
I<00:03:18.390> look<00:03:18.540> at<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> range<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> color<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.010> make

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
I look at a range of the color to make

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.760 
I look at a range of the color to make
sure<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.850> very<00:03:21.090> very<00:03:21.240> tight<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.110> also<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
sure it's very very tight and also the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.200 
sure it's very very tight and also the
diamonds<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> make<00:03:23.400> sure<00:03:23.520> there<00:03:23.670> are<00:03:23.820> affinity

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
diamonds to make sure there are affinity

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.570 
diamonds to make sure there are affinity
quality<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:25.320> know<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.980> appreciate<00:03:26.460> the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
quality you know and we appreciate the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.070
