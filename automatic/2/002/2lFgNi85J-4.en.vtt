00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.420
 Uh ... we have the longest player in the world ball fast oh ... which of course 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.009
 Chinese uh ... he's all in a mania of 76 ft. Services 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.589
 Reported six inches tall 70 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.059
 This guy has since kept up this 

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:21.960
 He was seven feet tall and nine inches tall 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.949
 We are pictures 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 Calumet data 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.639
 Also 

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.790
 Now the promise that you can tell your mother is the Eighties and the Japanese we are 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 Putting up a Japanese colleague is a bit tricky though 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.110
 The packets of it is that it can 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.210
 It is not as fast as the above n_b_a_ players so easy for me and then be twenty years old 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.400
 Five years old 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.609
 Of what was growth 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.010
 The wound that he ordered in his body that one of the existence 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 The two consequences were one of the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.900
 Causing the national growth in his body okay 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.780
 But second place is that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.499
 Which completely destroyed the inside and its ability 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.040
 Uh ... to keep the lid on the players so you know 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.640
 Obviously helpless you always give your winner to let you hear only one 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.890
 They took the growth inside the tumor outside 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.190
 Now it's so fine 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.480
 His stamina is getting higher and higher and his fitness is getting higher 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.010
 Top 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.160
 So far he may have a better chance 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.480
 You know I've been in the studio 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.570
 From 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.720
 At this point that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170
 Yugoslavia 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 Historical data is almost the reason 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.570
 Unless you are there 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.860
 Periodic adjustments 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.540
 Or if there are colleges of them 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
 The muscles that cover this personal dot are alone 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.940
 That is the thing that was a point to light up tried out the Lakers 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.160
 There were small small colors there 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.859
 however 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.939
 Such as used that led to use tonight 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.140
 It was ridiculously slow 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.930
 But you have to jump into it that he activists almost gathered it 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.760
 You do not have to jump into a duck 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.729
 It is like in Japanese leaders only possible to write housing with attach 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.920
 If distressed around their heads 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.749
 But one n_b_a_ numbers if you are interested in what it was 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.509
 He often got a rock now 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.280
 This is a problem as a problem for a person defending a crime problem 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 But it works on everything 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.210
 As you can see there you know why I like to look bad maybe you do 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.999
 This 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.040
 This has been hailed up at the scene 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.789
 This movement 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.949
 Someone else solves the tide and as their nature in different say that you have 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.559
 Reading this can be destroyed to confirm the fact that the outside 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:42.999
 His work on 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.269
 The ear is very slow in it's mortars 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.209
 If you need some help, give it to n_b_a_ 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.099
 Director Chris Dudley and all those clowns hanging around having n_b_a_ being like 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.480
 Eight inches short of that and will not be much more than a speaker in 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.369
 a house 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.819
 There are two men behave like ten years of time 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.180
 So maybe he had a shot 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.019
 So by you, what do you know then 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.609
 Waiting for the guy who does what the guide is put up to 9 and be fun for everyone 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.139
 But only to put out the poor but some food wait just one minute for me Japanese
