00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.240 

Kenny<00:00:01.170> well<00:00:01.319> sadly<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.650> think<00:00:01.829> we<00:00:01.890> spoke<00:00:02.100> about

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
Kenny well sadly I think we spoke about

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
Kenny well sadly I think we spoke about
the<00:00:02.460> players<00:00:02.669> finding<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.360> way<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.510> win<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
the players finding a way to win the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.420 
the players finding a way to win the
game<00:00:03.929> which<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.650> guess<00:00:04.799> was<00:00:04.980> important<00:00:05.370> because

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
game which I guess was important because

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.950 
game which I guess was important because
it<00:00:05.580> was<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> difference<00:00:06.029> or<00:00:06.180> again<00:00:06.450> 200<00:00:06.870> had

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
it was a difference or again 200 had

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.070 
it was a difference or again 200 had
recently<00:00:07.350> yeah<00:00:07.770> very<00:00:08.300> much<00:00:09.300> like<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> lot<00:00:09.960> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
recently yeah very much like a lot of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.480 
recently yeah very much like a lot of
the<00:00:10.139> games<00:00:10.260> around<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> country<00:00:11.010> very<00:00:11.219> tight

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the games around the country very tight

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180 
the games around the country very tight
bubbly<00:00:12.179> pitch<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.840> lot<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> games<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.950> know

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
bubbly pitch a lot on the games you know

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.799 
bubbly pitch a lot on the games you know
they're<00:00:14.370> very<00:00:14.790> important<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
they're very important and it's a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.900 
they're very important and it's a
different<00:00:16.080> type<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.260> football<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.760> no

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
different type of football but but no

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
different type of football but but no
less<00:00:18.150> important<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.840> win<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.230> thought<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
less important to win I thought that the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.150 
less important to win I thought that the
chances<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:20.970> were<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> game<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.560> created

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
chances that were in the game we created

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.540 
chances that were in the game we created
but<00:00:24.080> also<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> two<00:00:25.830> lads<00:00:26.070> coming<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
but also with the two lads coming on I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.830 
but also with the two lads coming on I
think<00:00:26.670> it'd<00:00:26.910> give<00:00:27.029> us<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> different<00:00:27.330> emphasis

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
think it'd give us a different emphasis

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
think it'd give us a different emphasis
and<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.310> time<00:00:29.519> in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and and you know for the first time in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
and and you know for the first time in
the<00:00:29.760> game<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.179> put<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.949> pressure<00:00:32.219> on

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the game really put a lot of pressure on

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
the game really put a lot of pressure on
MK<00:00:32.669> Dons<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> end<00:00:33.450> when<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.170> needed

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
MK Dons at the end when we really needed

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.799 
MK Dons at the end when we really needed
it<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.520> were<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.969> into<00:00:36.210> our<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.780> know

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
a tremendous amount of the support
you've<00:00:39.629> spoken<00:00:39.899> at<00:00:40.079> length<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.559> not

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you've spoken at length about it not

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319
