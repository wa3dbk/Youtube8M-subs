00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.710
 hello my dear lovers of everything 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 interesting and hidden in and on 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.580
 masterpieces of today's movie release 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 Easter eggs will be again dedicated to the movie 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.400
 the motives of the comic book series of the same name in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 70s 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.000
 from a marvel comics company called 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.449
 blade released on big screens in 1998 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 year 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.230
 well and let's start the search right away 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.699
 of all the interesting and hidden in this on 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.830
 my mind is a wonderful movie let's start 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:52.550
 the movie mentions the vampire bible 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.550
 holy book fish page book 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.970
 vampire bibles but rap according 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:04.379
 Greek mythology is the god of darkness 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.840
 only members of the house during the dialogue between 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.030
 frost and blade in the park frost says 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.250
 don't play uncle tom uncle on 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 street slang uncle tom is black 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 who tries to be like white but 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.990
 in this case it can be translated as 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.850
 a vampire who mows under the man 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 cinema was used for the first time in history 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.079
 bullet effect 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.149
 borrowed from japanese anime 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.250
 But before such films simply did not 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.369
 it was now possible in almost every 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.560
 action movie see slow flying bullets 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.829
 it turns out the blade was the founder 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.829
 such fragments 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 continuing it was calculated the number of victims in 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.860
 this movie 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 exactly 88 of them are so good 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 quantity 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.400
 and the dead almost only from 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.800
 the hands of the blade itself the scene where the blade and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.780
 Dr. Johnson arrives at speed 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.940
 the nightclub around the corner can be seen 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.040
 as a vampire drinks blood from the slain 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.200
 beauties so here is his guise 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.490
 hiding none other than the director of this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.500
 Steven Norrington 's film is in the film 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.750
 the moment when vampires walk in one 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
 superb penthouse and one small 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.830
 the girl is sitting on the floor in front of the TV 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.600
 if you look closely you can 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.090
 notice that there goes a movie under 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.850
 called death fight or just 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.980
 mortal kombat and i don't even know which one 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600
 the connection between these two masterpieces can 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.850
 be but rummaging in a little bit 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 Information I still found that Robert 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.560
 Schumann was a producer in both films and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 I think only in honor of this 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.780
 the director left here so slight 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.780
 mention 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.910
 well, another good secret from the movie 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 there is an alternative ending 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 which practically nobody before 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.970
 saw where the main villain frost 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.070
 turns into a huge blood god 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.440
 really great in time 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.630
 the final battle with blade and win 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.490
 his our hero is a completely different way here 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:17.280
 such a trifle but it seems to me all 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:19.200
 equally nice and well, today it was 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.670
 the last easter eggs who liked mine 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.890

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.050
