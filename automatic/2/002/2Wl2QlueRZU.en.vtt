00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.839
 has already had plenty of talk about 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.640
 self unleashing like of all fans of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.220

 ready to redeem a second access 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730
 episode a recent event has us 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 allowed to take a closer look 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.220
 near the title experiencing the first 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.220
 stages of play 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.710
 and mounts on myspace island in favor 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.710
 with gianni morandi 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.720
 at the narrative level we noticed a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.650
 particular focus on 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.960
 characterization of the characters 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.060
 as well as an attempt 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.950
 managed to engage the player in 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.810
 adrenaline-fueled story-driven sequences in 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.730
 first person in which a great person 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.110
 scripting manages to convey the high 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.110
 spectacularity of the script 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.710
 everything is expertly mixed 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 with some very particular interludes 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.670
 during which protagonist in the throes of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 hallucinations will travel the paths more 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 dark of one's psyche 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.570
 therefore 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 on a playful level, the is appreciable 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 variety of action that unites as usual 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.270
 a substantial exploratory component a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 combat moments as well 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 interesting exploiting both at 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.159
 mechanical apple trees and kill stars that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.159
 countless guns present 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.750
 also in this case the spectacularity a 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.750
 to lord it at least for how much 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.709
 we have been able to test until now 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.359
 wild and even wild beasts

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.390
 characterizes has not always lively and 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.390
 dynamic progression 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.720
 on a technical level how much we have 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.460
 especially observed on PC ha 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.470
 incredible modeling 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.390
 polygonal of elements and people to do 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.640
 rich in meticulous details ed 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.830
 embellished with a texturization 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.210
 superfine of surface maps 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.590
 complex high-level shaders ed 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.590
 optimization in a workmanlike manner 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.690
 the effects are not lacking 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.430
 special characterized by a 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.930
 ad hoc implementation of the effects 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.879
 particle and exploitation 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.890

 of absolute parity 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.329
 and how to forget about dubbing 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:42.910
 impeccable in the English version 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:44.530
