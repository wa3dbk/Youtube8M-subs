00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 I forgot the incendiary 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.820
 complete insurance 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.370
 something rÃ¶thenbacher here the people 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.290
 about 9000 years ago 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.890
 are definitely such jumped paths 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.620
 But we know that we too 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.650
 know that they are not so cool 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.410
 Flutes bags had this year 's 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:57.770
 a flash flood a stone age flute 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.780
 replica of which they were from berries 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.430
 bones and cranieal bones what the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.430
 wing bones made by cranes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 yes, how you play them is actually 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.770
 relatively easy you have to do a little 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 smile like next flute 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.069
 you have to have the lower lip soft 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.079
 make a narrow gap 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.049
 which is about as narrow as that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.929
 approach piece of then you squeeze the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.429
 lip under it leaves the flute like that 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.099
 the strength does not come to the head 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.359
 flute so the flute comes to buy there 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.359
 you just have to find the angle 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.469
 I found a flute bag 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.000
 They were hunters and gatherers 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.270
 and they were not just hunters and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.140
 collectors but also resourceful people 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.670
 maybe not so but I find 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.650
 that's why I have them as who led 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.270
 a little easier to play 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.270
 just as attractive 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
