00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
in other spots and I just find that

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.480 
in other spots and I just find that
these<00:07:20.720> work<00:07:21.080> really<00:07:21.110> good<00:07:21.650> at<00:07:21.920> just

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
these work really good at just

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.500 
these work really good at just
preventing<00:07:23.240> more<00:07:23.600> acne<00:07:23.840> from<00:07:24.350> showing<00:07:24.590> up<00:07:25.510> on

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540 
my skin and the alcohol free ones are

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.540 
my skin and the alcohol free ones are
really<00:07:29.750> really<00:07:30.110> great<00:07:30.350> because<00:07:30.950> they<00:07:31.310> aren't

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
really really great because they aren't
