machines and pipes suddenly connect to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.030 
machines and pipes suddenly connect to
the<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.520> true<00:01:09.210> changer<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.259> then

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the back my back true changer and then

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
the back my back true changer and then
suddenly<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> violin<00:01:12.090> appears<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.509> my<00:01:12.600> hand<00:01:12.890> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
suddenly a violin appears in my hand and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.529 
suddenly a violin appears in my hand and
then<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> violin<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
then what I do with the violin is I

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.690 
then what I do with the violin is I
start<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.200> playing<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.399> start

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
start I start playing and then I start

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.029 
start I start playing and then I start
dance<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> middle<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:19.680> that's

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
dance in the middle so I think that's

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.420 
dance in the middle so I think that's
probably<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.979> biggest<00:01:22.979> highlights

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
probably one of the biggest highlights

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.300 
probably one of the biggest highlights
in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> music<00:01:23.940> video<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.320> felt<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.009> Iron

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
in the music video and I felt like Iron

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.300 
in the music video and I felt like Iron
