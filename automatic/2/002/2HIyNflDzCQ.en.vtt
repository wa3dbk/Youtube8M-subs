going through what they expect from a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.620

out<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.109> totally<00:00:16.320> unreal<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.520> think<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
out it just totally unreal and I think a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.859 
out it just totally unreal and I think a
lot<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.150> due<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> fact<00:00:18.810> that

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
lot of it's due to the fact that

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
lot of it's due to the fact that
whippets<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.500> been<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:20.430> big<00:00:20.609> duck<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
whippets have been really big duck in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.609 
whippets have been really big duck in
the<00:00:21.060> sport<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.539> press<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> internet<00:00:22.500> and

the sport and press on the internet and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
the sport and press on the internet and
such<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.250> think<00:00:23.820> people<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> get

such and I think people are going to get
a<00:00:24.630> pop<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.140> 12<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.740> Baldwin's<00:00:26.189> ready
