 American since we know motorola 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.930
 the motorola motorbike them which is a 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 entry-level phone marketed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.340
 to 120 euros in June 2014 which is therefore the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 third model of the new range 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 motorcycle there was the bike x y and the motorcycle jet 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 which was a bestseller as you the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 know and who is one moreover 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.009
 since it sells very well including 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 120 euros I call him back then we are 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.760
 on the unpacking video so we go 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.140
 make the little tour of the owner in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 any case from the box and then from the phone 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.140
 in a fast 1st perceived then especially 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 accessories then the box is everything 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 it suggests to us that there 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 will not have much to provide with the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 phone on the front of the box 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.469
 we look we find the particular logo 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.899
 motorola the inscription motorola the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 motorcycle model them which is specified here face 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.050
 to see the mobile turned on it's always 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 more friendly it gives a little more 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.260
 still peps the box and his person 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.000
 he finally in any case it brings you a 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 visual on the phone this kind a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 little bit more positive on the side of the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.920
 box we find particular number of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 sun especially we import the phone 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.890
 and the model xt 1022 motorola moto them 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.909
 good it's just to know that this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.490
 phone are also found 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.229
 sold under the reference xt 1022 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 good at the back of the box we find 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.259
 trade marks do you want it here is the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.460
 legal mention et cetera of the logo that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.380
 remind you that this phone is equipped 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 of android is simply 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.229
 basic android features 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.189
 that's how the jellies already know 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.299
 broken to tell you I already have 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.070
 watched the phone a first time 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.390
 so we will still continue manual 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 all the cd by the way it's not really 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 this protection because there is no 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.680
 void registration is just for you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
 to guard is just to say that the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 to call and actually point 9 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.189
 rebounds is the motorola logo but hey 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.100
 it's a sticker if we open the box on 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.880
 return the phone inside 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.979
 so first contacts of the phone 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 very very positive the dow is in 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 plastic a little bit but skin but 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.490
 very slightly and side of the phone 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.719
 are white glossy plastic 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.009
 it's a phone that finally for the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.360
 blow since it's white here it's a 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.280
 phone that presents very well that I 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.350
 find very very nice in its design 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
 a little rounded all the same at the back 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 here is a little strong m'bia the somewhere 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.149
 very nice very good grip 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 because of course he said Sunday 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 rather reasonable I will come back on this 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 aspect especially during the first test 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.140
 positive contacts a phone 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.730
 typically in the new generation 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.590
 in the new era that is part of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 the new era of motorola motorcycle 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.849
 the new era of this famous brand 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 American sino then the inter da box 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.390
 continued under the cradle on which 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 was asked what is the phone 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.370
 we are well we find the cable 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.290
 usb micro usb very well packed in his 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.510
 little bag we also find the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.859
 pedestrian kit which you see it is endowed 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.810
 simply plastic earphones 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.310
 gross 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.049
 a day where asia who show you this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.010
 that they are pedestrian here I am just going to do 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.200
 the usual test is that plastic 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.250
 well hard plastic hard bah yes we 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.470
 are an entry-level phone I 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.290
 remember it with so the microphone input 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.609
 since it is a pedestrian kit and the button 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.019
 blame it off the length of 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.389
 cable and jack 3.5 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.739
 So that's the pedestrian kit on 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.840
 find out what else with his box and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.609
 well we find up the little notice here 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 so let's go and will say party 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.250
 start the phone 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.859
 how to remove the battery cover 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.060
 as we turn on the phone ok and then 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.290
 a little extra guide that is 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.590
 that is what is all that is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 nine voices the standard recycling etc and so 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.739
 you see it there is still something 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.069
 which is missing in your opinion what is 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.510
 lack 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.549
 I give it to you in the mile we have the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.760
 doc on the pedestrian kit 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.750
 we have the phone of course we have the cable 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.209
 usb micro usb 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.769
 it lacks the AC adapter and yes this 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.169
 phone here and well marketed in 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.000
 a french version is a set 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.989
 proves in particular the guide but it is missing 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.549
 the AC adapter 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.780
 and yes means for the brand all 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.159
 simply to compress the price of 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.989
 manufacturing is necessarily yours 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.879
 offer an even higher selling price 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.169
 aggressive knowing that the mark is 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.389
 probably left like some 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.040
 competitors of the postulate that well you 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.449
 generally had an AC adapter 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.010
 at home actually makes these 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.900
 ultra current data to have at home 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.879
 a usb power adapter 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.930
 now if it's not the cabba 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.400
 unfortunately you will have to let go 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.329
 a few extra days for you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.109
 buy one because it is not 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.760
 supplied with the phone 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.280
 so it's capitulate tilt I find myself 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.440
 the box of the doc the entry pedestrian kit 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.310
 range usb usb micro cable not 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.049
 AC adapter 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.970
 and then the phone of course in him 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.289
 even from below its white version and so 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.310
 we see that I find very nice that 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.349
 I like a lot finally you know I am 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.790
 pretty fan of white versions and that's it 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.780
 barennes that is to say if it is 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.210
 necessarily that the test will arrive 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.680
 soon tests that I have like a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.180
 some impatience to do since I 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.770
 am quite intrigued especially for seven 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.540
 years this entry-level at motorola 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.370
 and I say she will soon inevitably 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.780
 for the test video before others 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.530
 unpacking videos of other mobiles etc 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.140
 etc. 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.160
 as you know that's it go I'll you 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.760
 see you soon for more tests and 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.760
 other unpacking video
