00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
actually most of the other notes just

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.560 
actually most of the other notes just
Peter<00:04:57.410> right<00:04:57.650> away<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:59.210> just<00:04:59.360> come<00:04:59.539> up

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
Peter right away and you just come up

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.930 
Peter right away and you just come up
with<00:04:59.780> this<00:04:59.870> nice<00:05:00.080> woody<00:05:00.440> finish<00:05:00.860> quite<00:05:01.669> warm

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
with this nice woody finish quite warm

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.850 
with this nice woody finish quite warm
in<00:05:02.389> the<00:05:02.570> back<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.960> throat<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.289> going<00:05:03.710> down

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
in the back of the throat and going down

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.390 
in the back of the throat and going down
to<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.110> alcohol<00:05:06.470> isn't<00:05:06.650> necessarily

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
to so the alcohol isn't necessarily

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.060 
to so the alcohol isn't necessarily
masked<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.260> works<00:05:09.260> well<00:05:09.500> with<00:05:09.800> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
masked but it works well with the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.520 
masked but it works well with the
flavors<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.639> are<00:05:10.789> there<00:05:11.139> it's<00:05:12.139> a<00:05:12.169> bit

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
flavors that are there it's a bit

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.680 
flavors that are there it's a bit
sweeter<00:05:13.010> than<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.610> tend<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.940> like<00:05:14.030> in<00:05:14.330> whiskies

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
sweeter than I tend to like in whiskies

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.920 
sweeter than I tend to like in whiskies
but<00:05:15.050> it's<00:05:15.260> not<00:05:15.440> overly<00:05:15.710> sweet<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.780> there's

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
but it's not overly sweet and there's

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.300 
but it's not overly sweet and there's
nothing<00:05:21.200> special<00:05:21.440> is<00:05:21.620> very<00:05:23.950> this<00:05:24.950> is<00:05:25.130> very

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
nothing special is very this is very

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.659 
nothing special is very this is very
well<00:05:25.490> done<00:05:25.870> it's<00:05:26.870> very<00:05:27.050> nice<00:05:30.550> comparing<00:05:31.550> this

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
well done it's very nice comparing this

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.640 
well done it's very nice comparing this
to<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:32.240> other<00:05:32.360> space<00:05:32.690> side<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.260> did<00:05:33.440> the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
to the other space side I just did the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.800 
to the other space side I just did the
valve<00:05:34.099> Vinny<00:05:34.340> this<00:05:35.000> is<00:05:35.150> actually<00:05:35.450> much<00:05:35.599> more

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
valve Vinny this is actually much more

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.750 
valve Vinny this is actually much more
well<00:05:35.990> balanced<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:38.349> actually<00:05:39.349> a<00:05:39.380> lot<00:05:39.560> more

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
well balanced and actually a lot more

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.600 
well balanced and actually a lot more
