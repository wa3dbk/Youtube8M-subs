00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.790
 good afternoon blue did a review two 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 I will order a polarist because through 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.590
 I'll break them 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.150
 ska so 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 two firms which one is very expensive it 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 bepul w yes unfortunately I do not have 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.699
 directly to the button into it externally 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.879
 external indicator that this bend took out 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:43.960
 10 so that you can see here well, slopes 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.760
 Some time ago I bought it in a very I 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.720
 I consider now big money yes 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.399
 tyson should not have looked at the floor 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.910
 almost 5,000 rubles for it 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 somewhere about three years ago I started releasing 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.760
 or not dad like you is released a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.550
 I will compare this filter and I will 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.860
 Compare the filters that I bought in China 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.560
 ordered is being done for japan that is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.800
 you will turn that kind of like the firm nusa 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.760
 China's water type is shorter in Japan 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.860
 shipped don't know what I can say 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.170
 let's give it from a box 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.960
 were had whole a3 not surprised that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 there is a certain mesolithic quality that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.070
 only a barcode then 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.159
 the product number, that is, I already like 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.890
 I liked it so particularly have 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.470
 contract validity did a recent review 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:44.680
 green l filter too from china nd filter 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.600
 this 4 is completely wrong here and there 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.200
 of course it was terrifying the quality that 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.050
 just but to put it mildly, it's generally 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.530
 no way just white balance went to 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.500
 Basically you can see it below. 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.560
 sending to the bullet again read on 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.960
 site as if on my own, I also laid out 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.390
 the comparison here is the video just the pictures are not 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.950
 showing sites have good pictures 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.430
 as you can just put her 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.980
 understand very much i say mean this filter 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.810
 off well let's give this atlas 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.330
 filter seventy two millimeters just 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.850
 I bought my channel I needed it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.630
 diameter 7 2 millimeter or filter 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.190
 sixty seven millimeters mean well 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.420
 what can I say here is a box principle 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.150
 classic smoking she's so 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 big enough here for 13 rows 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.459
 filter yes maybe even 82 millimeter 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.560
 that is, did not bother and makes 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.630
 reinforce your box or your 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.030
 base 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.519
 distorted fuck with him that means something 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.890
 this one cost 900 rubles contact dough 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.680
 burning running ahead I will say that the quality 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.380
 the filter is superb and I have nothing to pay 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.590
 edward this is no less let's see 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.230
 then look again say filter 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.610
 firms carry yourself ranges enough 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.860
 different this filter is not the most expensive 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.020
 well that's when even one of the easiest 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.020
 right here to start rapan itself 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.010
 series not bw w white band that is 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.340
 proper wide-angles hoarse there 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.140
 whole 2 millimeters to 62 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.380
 that's why why all 2 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.580
 Well, the thing is , I bought it for 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:39.860
 nowhere 35-70 yes there actually all 2 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.950
 millimeter directly returned 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.350
 it means all 2 millimeters and I wanted 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.700
 used not to feed 35-70 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.260
 which is a diaphragm 28 on that is 5 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.630
 millimeters use as 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.540
 wide angle and yes well it's a little bit 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.070
 now does not teach. because here it is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.080
 the video that I am shooting now I am shooting 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.500
 overtaken and out of five millimeters 14 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:08.060
 which I will review later on 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.690
 so kawasan this filter will be well 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.989
 will simply mean that the respect and 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.310
 on the quality of the band were like mine 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.350
 three years now I can say that here he is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.010
 now strange 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.010
 scrolls listen 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.669
 but there are enough structures like that 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.990
 strange I mean, I understand that this 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.370
 metal something inside there rubs 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.280
 yes I do not know maybe lubrication 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.440
 some went well, accounting principle can not 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.500
 annoying you tell me the filters 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.449
 Sorry so glad to be well in general how 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180
 would have arranged for a pass in front of what it cost 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.810
 5000 rubles as at isar mercedes world 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.050
 cars yes and damn the roads this is who he 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.710
 must quality fucking be so and on 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.780
 cheat well there visited enlightenment 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.960
 strengthen claims no yes there is generally 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:14.560
 that is pure enough and means about 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.960
 as it appears polarizes here I am 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.190
 here is just done a test and again 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.930
 look at the link below 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.080
 here that surprised me that polarizes here 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.870
 this japanese filter 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.479
 slightly stronger than this one here but 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.919
 there is such a feature 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.979
 Japanese filter will be a little balance 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.820
 white in the field is a warm version 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.010
 enough 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.080
 how would like to like someone 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.530
 may not like it in frequency 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.669
 contrast pictures for sharpness 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.370
 some parameters 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.470
 the difference is honest, I did not see here I can 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.669
 say that someone 150 rubles to 5000 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.720
 there is no difference for respectively 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.020
 More runs on constructive 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.490
 annecy 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.490
 well look listen 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.320
 I do not know or not heard but in general 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:17.440
 so far enough is such a shah 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.180
 becoming such a sound is normal 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.160
 enlightenment by he's some on it 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:28.210
 Naturally there is a glare here 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:33.520
 Should should not clean well as 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:37.540
 as if from the sky they make more significant than be 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.580
 + w yes that is, well, in general, let's say that 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.890
 There is a whole look at the site 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:46.090
 comparisons yes there I did one hundred percent 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.680
 grain and the center of the corner this filter is very 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.720
 very upset about the quality given 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.670
 what are you considered to be a type of budget option 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.950
 missions because i'm a bike this 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.400
 much more expensive and the prices there are the same as in 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.430
 principle be + w yes i can say 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.510
 that is very good good filter 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.790
 I plan to order myself next 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:09.730
 some kind of neutral gray filter on 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:12.280
 so that at 714 shoot on the towers more 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:17.110
 1 4 4 thousand because t610 is not 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:21.130
 It supports the above excerpt is what more 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:25.360
 Basically I can say nothing more 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:28.660
 I will say yes such a noble here I just can 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.390
 recommend yes that is a comparison 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.600
 ska so with a very expensive filter this 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.320
 the filter held and I will now be them 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.480
 recommend 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.940
 and do not order accordingly 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.170
 a test that will lay out everything to everyone 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.330
 thank you for your attention bye 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:48.940
 The next review will be worth sigma 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:52.590
 sigma 35 millimeters 14 art dissected 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.590
