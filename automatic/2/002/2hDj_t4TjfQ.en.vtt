first<00:01:46.979> time<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:47.670> ever<00:01:47.700> opened<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
first time I think I've ever opened a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
first time I think I've ever opened a
figure<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.840> camera<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.159> guys<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.490> doing

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
figure on camera so you guys are doing

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.090 
figure on camera so you guys are doing
this<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.090> me<00:01:51.299> hold<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.780> tight<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this with me hold on tight it's gonna be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
this with me hold on tight it's gonna be
a<00:01:53.130> bumpy<00:01:53.610> ride<00:01:53.640> no<00:01:54.119> probably<00:01:55.079> not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
a bumpy ride no probably not

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
a bumpy ride no probably not
anyway<00:01:56.280> let's<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> figure<00:01:57.060> open<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> take

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
anyway let's get to figure open and take

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
anyway let's get to figure open and take
a<00:01:58.259> peek<00:01:58.890> nice<00:01:59.729> easy<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.570> open<00:02:00.689> package<00:02:01.520> he<00:02:02.520> does

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
a peek nice easy to open package he does

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.789 
a peek nice easy to open package he does
have<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.590> rubber<00:02:04.950> band<00:02:05.250> thingies<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
have the little rubber band thingies I

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.990 
have the little rubber band thingies I
don't<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.039> cut<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.399> because<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.759> save

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
don't like to cut those because I save

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.800 
don't like to cut those because I save
them<00:02:09.209> used<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:09.869> props<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
them used for props so I

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.550 
them used for props so I
come<00:02:11.050> out<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.319> pull<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.590> out<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
come out and pull it out like that to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.890 
come out and pull it out like that to
figure<00:02:17.860> out<00:02:20.489> relatively<00:02:21.489> easily<00:02:21.760> not<00:02:22.150> too<00:02:22.360> bad

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
figure out relatively easily not too bad

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.720 
figure out relatively easily not too bad
say<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.500> put<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.160> save<00:02:24.489> all<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
say for that I put that I save all the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.930 
say for that I put that I save all the
packaging<00:02:25.209> for<00:02:25.420> special<00:02:25.989> figures<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.440> this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
packaging for special figures like this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.220 
packaging for special figures like this
which<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.120> always<00:02:28.360> something<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.930> recommend

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
which is always something I recommend

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.850 
which is always something I recommend
and<00:02:29.680> I'm<00:02:30.370> kind<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.700> disappointed<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.650> only<00:02:32.650> was

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
and I'm kind of disappointed I only was

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.559 
and I'm kind of disappointed I only was
able<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.099> get<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.400> red<00:02:33.550> part<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.360> one

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
able to get that red part out that one

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.720 
able to get that red part out that one
part<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.260> belly<00:02:35.440> button<00:02:35.739> area<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.310> gonna

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
part in the belly button area is gonna

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.000 
part in the belly button area is gonna
stay<00:02:37.060> messed<00:02:37.300> up<00:02:37.560> although<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.590> don't<00:02:38.709> think

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
stay messed up although I don't think

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.320 
stay messed up although I don't think
you<00:02:39.069> can<00:02:39.220> even<00:02:39.310> see<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.730> camera<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.209> it's

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
you can even see it on camera so it's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.220 
you can even see it on camera so it's
not<00:02:40.390> too<00:02:40.569> big<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.870> deal

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
not too big of a deal

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.979 
not too big of a deal
I'm<00:02:41.890> kind<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.700> okay<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.299> although<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.900> is

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
I'm kind of okay with it although it is

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.690 
I'm kind of okay with it although it is
an<00:02:44.110> exclusive<00:02:44.410> figure<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.130> special<00:02:45.459> figure

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
an exclusive figure and a special figure

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.580 
an exclusive figure and a special figure
they<00:02:45.880> should<00:02:46.120> kind<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.569> focus<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.140> paint<00:02:47.410> work

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
they should kind of focus on paint work

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.530 
they should kind of focus on paint work
but<00:02:47.860> whatever<00:02:48.540> he<00:02:49.540> stands<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:52.360> nearly

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
but whatever he stands actually nearly

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.090 
but whatever he stands actually nearly
seven<00:02:52.959> inches<00:02:53.170> tall<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.410> he's<00:02:53.709> probably<00:02:53.830> a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
seven inches tall so he's probably a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.300 
seven inches tall so he's probably a
little<00:02:54.370> bit<00:02:54.489> taller<00:02:54.730> than<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:56.560> standard<00:02:57.220> I

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
little bit taller than a standard I

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.350 
little bit taller than a standard I
think<00:02:57.489> they<00:02:57.580> come<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.849> at<00:02:57.970> six<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.330> half

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
think they come in at six and a half

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.199 
think they come in at six and a half
inches<00:02:58.870> tall<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.230> standard<00:02:59.590> DCU<00:03:00.160> but<00:03:01.060> that's

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
inches tall the standard DCU but that's

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.750 
inches tall the standard DCU but that's
okay<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.349> really<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> vaccum

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
okay I like it I really like the vaccum

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.370 
okay I like it I really like the vaccum
chrome<00:03:04.030> there's<00:03:04.569> some<00:03:04.720> fingerprints<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.349> it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
chrome there's some fingerprints on it

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.289 
chrome there's some fingerprints on it
not<00:03:05.650> for<00:03:05.860> me<00:03:06.040> hopefully<00:03:06.459> those<00:03:06.610> come<00:03:06.849> out<00:03:06.880> I

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
not for me hopefully those come out I

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.750 
not for me hopefully those come out I
think<00:03:07.870> they<00:03:07.989> will<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.190> vacuum<00:03:09.400> chrome

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
think they will but the vacuum chrome

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.009 
think they will but the vacuum chrome
has<00:03:09.970> done<00:03:10.090> really<00:03:10.390> well<00:03:10.690> hopefully<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:12.730> not

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
has done really well hopefully it's not

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.300 
has done really well hopefully it's not
there's<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.110> chip<00:03:14.340> there's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.430> chip<00:03:17.310> yeah

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
there's a chip there's a chip yeah

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.949 
there's a chip there's a chip yeah
bummer<00:03:18.640> oh<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.269> bottom<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:19.840> not

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
bummer oh it's on the bottom so it's not

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.990 
bummer oh it's on the bottom so it's not
so<00:03:20.200> bad<00:03:20.440> hopefully<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> vacuum<00:03:21.730> has

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
so bad hopefully the vacuum has

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
so bad hopefully the vacuum has
progressed<00:03:22.660> since<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.230> late<00:03:23.590> 90s<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
progressed since the late 90s with the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.309 
progressed since the late 90s with the
Beast<00:03:24.489> Wars<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.060> other<00:03:25.720> Transformers

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.599 
Beast Wars and other Transformers
figures<00:03:26.650> because<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:26.980> used<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.220> chip<00:03:27.430> off

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
figures because that used to chip off

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.130 
figures because that used to chip off
easily<00:03:27.880> hopefully<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.660> stuff<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.959> better

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
easily hopefully this stuff is better

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.470 
easily hopefully this stuff is better
the<00:03:29.799> gold<00:03:30.040> wings<00:03:30.340> are<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.940> gold<00:03:31.150> do<00:03:31.359> not

figures<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:41.050> my<00:04:41.710> biggest<00:04:41.950> gripe<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:42.490> that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
figures have my biggest gripe is that

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.340 
figures have my biggest gripe is that
they<00:04:42.730> put<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.150> there<00:04:43.570> again<00:04:43.690> put<00:04:44.170> it<00:04:44.260> on

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
they put that on there again put it on

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.410 
they put that on there again put it on
the<00:04:44.440> bottom<00:04:44.620> Mattel<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.610> don't<00:04:45.790> like<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.210> the

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
the bottom Mattel I don't like it on the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.210 
the bottom Mattel I don't like it on the
visible<00:04:46.840> parts<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.290> figure<00:04:47.560> but<00:04:48.100> either

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
visible parts of the figure but either

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.460 
visible parts of the figure but either
way<00:04:48.430> it's<00:04:48.850> still<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:49.060> really<00:04:49.420> cool<00:04:49.450> figure<00:04:49.870> it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
way it's still a really cool figure it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.720 
way it's still a really cool figure it
would<00:04:50.620> have<00:04:50.710> been<00:04:50.830> nice<00:04:51.010> if<00:04:51.220> he<00:04:51.310> came<00:04:51.490> with<00:04:51.700> a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
would have been nice if he came with a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.460 
would have been nice if he came with a
base<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.300> know<00:04:52.390> what<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.600> was<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> blue<00:04:53.020> DC

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
base you know what it was a blue DC

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.410 
base you know what it was a blue DC
universe<00:04:53.920> or<00:04:54.160> whatever<00:04:54.670> kind<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.030> base<00:04:55.180> is

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
universe or whatever kind of base is

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.410 
universe or whatever kind of base is
because<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.650> flash<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.370> it's<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:58.150> lot

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
because it's the flash and it's a lot

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.250 
because it's the flash and it's a lot
easier<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.960> pose<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.500> flash<00:04:59.800> running<00:05:00.670> if<00:05:01.660> you

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
easier to pose the flash running if you

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.330 
easier to pose the flash running if you
have<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.890> base<00:05:03.670> for<00:05:04.120> his<00:05:04.270> foot<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.690> peg<00:05:04.900> into<00:05:05.340> if

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
have a base for his foot to peg into if

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.320 
have a base for his foot to peg into if
you<00:05:06.610> don't<00:05:07.860> then<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.610> gonna<00:05:09.820> be<00:05:09.910> a<00:05:10.060> little

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
you don't then it's gonna be a little

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.540 
you don't then it's gonna be a little
tricky<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.050> get<00:05:11.200> into<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.470> balance<00:05:11.830> luckily<00:05:12.520> I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
tricky to get into the balance luckily I

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.640 
tricky to get into the balance luckily I
have<00:05:12.760> a<00:05:12.790> few<00:05:13.000> extras<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.140> don't<00:05:14.320> put<00:05:14.560> my

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
have a few extras and I don't put my

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.050 
have a few extras and I don't put my
fingers<00:05:14.920> on<00:05:15.010> display<00:05:15.340> right<00:05:15.520> now<00:05:15.640> anyway<00:05:16.000> so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
fingers on display right now anyway so

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.720 
fingers on display right now anyway so
it'll<00:05:16.570> be<00:05:16.690> okay<00:05:16.720> for<00:05:17.290> now<00:05:17.440> but<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.610> is

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
it'll be okay for now but that is

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.100 
it'll be okay for now but that is
something<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.060> take<00:05:19.300> note<00:05:19.330> he<00:05:19.660> doesn't<00:05:19.960> have<00:05:20.080> a

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
base at all

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
base at all
maybe<00:05:22.180> that's<00:05:22.390> normal<00:05:22.690> for<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.930> Mandy

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
maybe that's normal for the Mandy

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.540 
maybe that's normal for the Mandy
collector<00:05:23.560> figures<00:05:23.920> but<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.220> think<00:05:24.460> they

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
collector figures but I think they

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.790 
collector figures but I think they
should<00:05:24.730> have<00:05:24.760> that<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.960> there<00:05:26.260> he<00:05:26.320> is<00:05:26.380> let<00:05:26.770> me

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
should have that so there he is let me

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.050 
should have that so there he is let me
know<00:05:26.860> what<00:05:26.980> you<00:05:27.070> guys<00:05:27.190> think<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.640> wish<00:05:27.790> he<00:05:27.910> was<00:05:28.030> a

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
know what you guys think I wish he was a

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.670 
know what you guys think I wish he was a
little<00:05:28.420> bit<00:05:28.540> nicer<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.080> know<00:05:29.110> since<00:05:29.440> it's<00:05:29.620> a

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
little bit nicer you know since it's a

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.500 
little bit nicer you know since it's a
collector's<00:05:30.070> figure<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.700> little<00:05:31.120> bit<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.300> paint

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
collector's figure a little bit of paint

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.810 
collector's figure a little bit of paint
problem<00:05:31.810> there<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.560> no<00:05:32.740> base<00:05:32.980> but<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.640> still

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
problem there and no base but it's still

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.340 
problem there and no base but it's still
a<00:05:33.880> great<00:05:34.060> figure<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.510> if<00:05:34.810> you're<00:05:34.930> able<00:05:35.170> to<00:05:35.200> get

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350
