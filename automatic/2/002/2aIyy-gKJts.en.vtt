00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.810 

okay<00:00:36.559> here<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:36.739> go<00:00:36.829> hopping<00:00:37.219> into<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.640> car

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
okay here we go hopping into the car

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.610 
okay here we go hopping into the car
it's<00:00:38.270> not<00:00:38.420> as<00:00:38.539> easy<00:00:38.719> as<00:00:38.840> a<00:00:38.930> road<00:00:39.140> car<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.530> get

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
it's not as easy as a road car to get

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.319 
it's not as easy as a road car to get
into<00:00:39.949> obviously<00:00:40.460> we've<00:00:40.760> got<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:40.910> roll<00:00:41.090> cage

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
into obviously we've got the roll cage

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.740 
into obviously we've got the roll cage
and<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:41.719> deep<00:00:42.260> bucket<00:00:42.620> seats<00:00:43.149> a<00:00:44.149> lot<00:00:44.660> of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
and in deep bucket seats a lot of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.060 
and in deep bucket seats a lot of
differences<00:00:45.199> obviously<00:00:45.350> between<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.920> road

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
differences obviously between the road

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.579 
differences obviously between the road
car<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.339> this<00:00:46.519> car<00:00:46.960> two<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.170> biggest<00:00:48.320> ones

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
car and this car two of the biggest ones

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.470 
car and this car two of the biggest ones
you<00:00:48.680> can<00:00:48.829> see<00:00:48.860> here<00:00:49.280> both<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.489> handbrake

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
you can see here both the handbrake

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.819 
you can see here both the handbrake
lever<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> gearshift<00:00:51.469> totally

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
lever and the gearshift totally

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.100 
lever and the gearshift totally
different<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:52.280> normal<00:00:53.000> car<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:53.809> normally

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
different to a normal car and normally

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.290 
different to a normal car and normally
you'd<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.409> a<00:00:54.440> gear<00:00:54.890> shift<00:00:54.920> here<00:00:55.339> but<00:00:55.969> we've

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
you'd have a gear shift here but we've

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.549 
you'd have a gear shift here but we've
actually<00:00:56.420> got<00:00:56.659> a<00:00:56.690> handbrake<00:00:57.079> lever<00:00:57.110> which

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
actually got a handbrake lever which

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.250 
actually got a handbrake lever which
helps<00:00:58.159> us<00:00:58.250> do<00:00:58.399> handbrake<00:00:58.729> turns<00:00:59.030> in<00:00:59.989> tricky

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
helps us do handbrake turns in tricky

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.660 
helps us do handbrake turns in tricky
situations<00:01:00.890> or<00:01:01.070> if<00:01:01.159> we're<00:01:01.309> going<00:01:01.430> too<00:01:01.640> fast

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
situations or if we're going too fast

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.840 
situations or if we're going too fast
with<00:01:02.120> one<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:02.479> quickly<00:01:03.199> pull<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.850> it'll

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
with one we quickly pull it and it'll

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.370 
with one we quickly pull it and it'll
get<00:01:04.970> us<00:01:05.089> out<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.479> an<00:01:05.840> understeer<00:01:06.350> or

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
get us out of a an understeer or

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.529 
get us out of a an understeer or
something<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:06.910> also<00:01:07.910> we've<00:01:08.300> got<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
something like that also we've got the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.480 
something like that also we've got the
gear<00:01:08.990> shift<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:09.440> which<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.280> lot<00:01:10.460> easier

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
gear shift here which is a lot easier

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.120 
gear shift here which is a lot easier
than<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.940> normal<00:01:11.179> Road<00:01:11.330> car<00:01:11.570> we<00:01:12.410> just<00:01:12.440> pull<00:01:13.100> up

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
than a normal Road car we just pull up

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.499 
than a normal Road car we just pull up
you<00:01:13.550> can<00:01:13.670> do<00:01:13.759> it<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:13.909> one<00:01:14.060> finger<00:01:14.270> if<00:01:14.479> you

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
you can do it with one finger if you

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.870 
you can do it with one finger if you
want<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.929> that<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.009> shift<00:01:16.159> up<00:01:16.340> gears<00:01:16.670> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
want and that will shift up gears and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.510 
want and that will shift up gears and
push<00:01:17.420> away<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:18.050> go<00:01:18.170> down<00:01:18.380> gears<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:19.340> don't

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
push away to go down gears you don't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.760 
push away to go down gears you don't
have<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.700> use<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> clutch<00:01:20.179> or<00:01:20.479> or<00:01:21.380> anything<00:01:21.560> like

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
have to use a clutch or or anything like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.290 
have to use a clutch or or anything like
that<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.130> can<00:01:22.159> stay<00:01:22.429> full<00:01:22.670> throttle<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.119> just

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
that you can stay full throttle and just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.330 
that you can stay full throttle and just
keep<00:01:23.450> pulling<00:01:23.869> up<00:01:23.960> years<00:01:24.200> which<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.130> quite

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
keep pulling up years which is quite

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.969 
keep pulling up years which is quite
good<00:01:25.520> fun<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.240> easy<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.659> drive<00:01:26.920> as<00:01:27.920> you

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
good fun it's it's easy to drive as you

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.889 
good fun it's it's easy to drive as you
can<00:01:28.250> see<00:01:28.429> here<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:29.450> steering<00:01:29.690> wheel

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
can see here this is the steering wheel

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.169 
can see here this is the steering wheel
of<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.229> Impreza<00:01:30.890> world<00:01:31.130> rally<00:01:31.280> car<00:01:31.369> it's

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
of the Impreza world rally car it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.450 
of the Impreza world rally car it's
actually<00:01:32.509> made<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.200> carbon<00:01:33.530> fiber<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.220> it's

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
actually made of carbon fiber so it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.639 
actually made of carbon fiber so it's
lightweight<00:01:34.909> which<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.720> good<00:01:35.929> for<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
lightweight which is good for the the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.930 
lightweight which is good for the the
centre<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:36.979> gravity<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.490> because<00:01:37.789> it's

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
centre of gravity and that because it's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.149 
centre of gravity and that because it's
quite<00:01:38.119> up<00:01:38.270> high<00:01:38.450> also<00:01:39.080> there's<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.619> lot<00:01:40.040> of

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
quite up high also there's a lot of

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.850 
quite up high also there's a lot of
buttons<00:01:40.460> here<00:01:40.990> quite<00:01:41.990> simple<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.350> use<00:01:42.500> really

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
buttons here quite simple to use really

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.690 
buttons here quite simple to use really
we've<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.280> got<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.790> washer<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.560> wipe<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.070> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
we've just got a washer and wipe and a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.609 
we've just got a washer and wipe and a
marker<00:01:47.090> button<00:01:47.270> which<00:01:47.509> helps<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.259> engineers

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
marker button which helps the engineers

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.870 
marker button which helps the engineers
if<00:01:48.799> we<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.070> problem<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.549> car<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:49.850> can

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
if we have a problem with the car we can

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.639 
if we have a problem with the car we can
press<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.180> red<00:01:50.450> button<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.380> will<00:01:51.469> put

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
press that red button and that will put

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.560 
press that red button and that will put
a<00:01:51.680> mark<00:01:51.950> in<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.219> data<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.210> other<00:01:53.360> two

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
a mark in the data and the other two

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.499 
a mark in the data and the other two
were<00:01:53.719> just<00:01:53.750> for<00:01:54.200> our<00:01:54.469> headlights<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.520> our

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
were just for our headlights and our

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.060 
were just for our headlights and our
launch<00:01:56.780> control<00:01:57.229> which<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.500> use<00:01:57.619> at<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.829> start

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
launch control which we use at the start

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.010 
launch control which we use at the start
line<00:01:58.250> generally<00:01:59.240> during<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> stage<00:01:59.840> you

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
line generally during the stage you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.050 
line generally during the stage you
don't<00:02:00.140> use<00:02:00.409> them<00:02:00.619> much<00:02:00.649> just<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.460> washer<00:02:01.789> but

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
don't use them much just the washer but

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060 
don't use them much just the washer but
Glen's<00:02:02.600> also<00:02:02.930> got<00:02:03.110> them<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.380> his<00:02:03.530> side<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.039> he

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
Glen's also got them on his side so he

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.560 
Glen's also got them on his side so he
can<00:02:04.670> use<00:02:04.820> them

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
can use them

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.940 
can use them
if<00:02:05.960> we<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.230> some<00:02:06.410> mud<00:02:06.560> come<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
if we have some mud come on the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.070 
if we have some mud come on the
windscreen<00:02:07.340> or<00:02:07.460> something<00:02:07.730> like<00:02:07.820> that

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
windscreen or something like that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.260 
windscreen or something like that
obviously<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.979> lot<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.460> controls<00:02:10.880> here<00:02:11.000> that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
obviously a lot of controls here that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.760 
obviously a lot of controls here that
are<00:02:11.360> different<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.840> road<00:02:12.230> car<00:02:12.440> as<00:02:12.590> well

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
are different to a road car as well

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.950 
are different to a road car as well
we've<00:02:12.920> got<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> lot<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.250> circuit<00:02:13.640> breakers

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
we've got a lot of circuit breakers

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.020 
we've got a lot of circuit breakers
which<00:02:14.960> we're<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> put<00:02:15.290> all<00:02:15.560> these<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
which we're going to put all these in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.490 
which we're going to put all these in
with<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> system<00:02:17.420> when<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.630> start<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.020> car<00:02:18.260> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
with a system when we start the car and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.680 
with a system when we start the car and
then<00:02:19.160> once<00:02:19.610> we're<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.210> stage<00:02:20.450> as

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
then once we're going on the stage as

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.110 
then once we're going on the stage as
well<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.620> put<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> them<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.550> and

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
well so we put all of them in and and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.970 
well so we put all of them in and and
hopefully<00:02:24.050> they<00:02:24.200> will<00:02:24.350> say<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:24.860> have

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
hopefully they will say and then we have

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.820 
hopefully they will say and then we have
no<00:02:25.100> problems<00:02:25.720> when<00:02:26.720> we're<00:02:26.930> we're<00:02:27.470> talking

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
no problems when we're we're talking

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.610 
no problems when we're we're talking
about<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.190> start<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.520> stage<00:02:29.500> firstly<00:02:30.500> we've

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
about the start of a stage firstly we've

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.260 
about the start of a stage firstly we've
got<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.830> year<00:02:31.340> selection<00:02:31.760> device<00:02:31.970> here<00:02:32.240> which

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
got a year selection device here which

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.680 
got a year selection device here which
is<00:02:32.600> obviously<00:02:32.900> different<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.740> car<00:02:34.040> again

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
is obviously different to a car again

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.420 
is obviously different to a car again
we've<00:02:35.690> got<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> road<00:02:36.080> mode<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.860> stage<00:02:37.100> mode

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
we've got a road mode and a stage mode

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.680 
we've got a road mode and a stage mode
and<00:02:37.700> reverse<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.440> obviously<00:02:39.440> neutral<00:02:39.920> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and reverse and obviously neutral so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.970 
and reverse and obviously neutral so
obviously<00:02:41.690> put<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> clutch<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.560> then

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
obviously put the clutch in and then

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.800 
obviously put the clutch in and then
select<00:02:43.340> either<00:02:43.550> road<00:02:43.910> or<00:02:44.180> stage<00:02:44.420> depending

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
select either road or stage depending

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.690 
select either road or stage depending
what<00:02:45.050> we're<00:02:45.170> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.160> drive

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
what we're going to do and then drive

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.810 
what we're going to do and then drive
off<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.090> use<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> gears<00:02:48.520> another<00:02:49.520> switch

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
off and use the gears another switch

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.130 
off and use the gears another switch
which<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.210> very<00:02:50.390> important<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.870> start<00:02:51.110> of

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
which is very important at the start of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.380 
which is very important at the start of
the<00:02:51.230> stage<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.860> anti<00:02:52.580> lag<00:02:52.730> switch<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the stage is the anti lag switch and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.480 
the stage is the anti lag switch and
this<00:02:53.540> gives<00:02:53.780> us<00:02:53.900> instant<00:02:54.230> response<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.460> you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
this gives us instant response so you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
this gives us instant response so you
don't<00:02:55.700> want<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> run<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.210> when<00:02:56.390> you're

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
don't want to run with this when you're

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.090 
don't want to run with this when you're
driving<00:02:56.630> along<00:02:56.810> slowly<00:02:57.140> because<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.860> builds

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
driving along slowly because it builds

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.920 
driving along slowly because it builds
up<00:02:58.220> enormous<00:02:58.520> amount<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:58.970> heat<00:02:59.120> in<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> turbo

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
up enormous amount of heat in the turbo

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
up enormous amount of heat in the turbo
but<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:00.980> turn<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.400> at<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.610> start<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
but we turn it on at the start of the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000 
but we turn it on at the start of the
stage<00:03:02.180> usually<00:03:02.780> under<00:03:03.200> three<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> maximum

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
stage usually under three the maximum

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.000 
stage usually under three the maximum
and<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:05.120> go<00:03:05.330> flat<00:03:05.600> out<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.930> gives<00:03:06.080> great

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and and go flat out it gives great

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.650 
and and go flat out it gives great
response<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.209> let<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.450> car<00:03:08.630> go

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
response and you can let the car go

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.390 
response and you can let the car go
really<00:03:09.110> slow<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:09.860> hit<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.070> throttle

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
really slow and then hit the throttle

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.040 
really slow and then hit the throttle
and<00:03:10.489> you've<00:03:10.610> got<00:03:10.730> full<00:03:10.970> boost<00:03:11.180> which<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.660> is

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
and you've got full boost which is is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.830 
and you've got full boost which is is
amazing<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.650> drive<00:03:12.860> with<00:03:13.850> stage<00:03:14.120> mode<00:03:14.480> engage

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
amazing to drive with stage mode engage

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.660 
amazing to drive with stage mode engage

from<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.510> angle<00:03:24.719> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:25.079> we're

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
from this angle you can see we're

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.020 
from this angle you can see we're
sitting<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.799> long<00:03:26.099> way<00:03:26.219> back<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.640> well<00:03:26.819> we're

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
sitting in a long way back as well we're

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.030 
sitting in a long way back as well we're
back<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.049> b-pillar<00:03:28.230> which<00:03:28.829> is

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
back here with the b-pillar which is

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.380 
back here with the b-pillar which is
nearly<00:03:29.250> halfway<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.790> back<00:03:29.969> seat

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
nearly halfway in the back seat

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.699 
nearly halfway in the back seat
that<00:03:30.689> means<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.989> steering<00:03:31.319> wheel<00:03:31.469> and<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
that means a steering wheel and the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.670 
that means a steering wheel and the
pedals<00:03:31.739> are<00:03:32.459> all<00:03:32.670> brought<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.480> way<00:03:33.689> and<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
pedals are all brought this way and this

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.589 
pedals are all brought this way and this
helps<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.250> center<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.579> gravity<00:03:35.939> we're

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
helps to the center of gravity we're

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.660 
helps to the center of gravity we're
sitting<00:03:36.840> low<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.349> far<00:03:37.890> back<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> cars

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
sitting low and far back so the cars

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.819 
sitting low and far back so the cars
nice<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.120> balanced<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:40.500> all<00:03:40.680> helps

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
nice and balanced and this all helps

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.860 
nice and balanced and this all helps
with<00:03:41.040> performance<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:42.150> some<00:03:42.359> other<00:03:42.510> small

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.200 
again the pedals are a long way back but
generally<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> setups<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.820> same<00:05:00.030> as<00:05:00.180> a

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
generally the setups the same as a

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.610 
generally the setups the same as a
normal<00:05:00.300> road<00:05:00.599> car<00:05:00.840> you've<00:05:00.960> got<00:05:00.990> your<00:05:01.229> throttle

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
normal road car you've got your throttle

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.820 
normal road car you've got your throttle
brake<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.490> then<00:05:02.759> clutch<00:05:03.650> generally<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.740> only

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
brake and then clutch generally the only

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.409 
brake and then clutch generally the only
two<00:05:05.070> we<00:05:05.190> care<00:05:05.370> about<00:05:05.460> obviously<00:05:05.759> the<00:05:06.000> throttle

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
two we care about obviously the throttle

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.689 
two we care about obviously the throttle
and<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.599> brake<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.440> brakes<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:08.190> lot<00:05:08.490> bigger

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
and the brake the brakes a lot bigger

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.430 
and the brake the brakes a lot bigger
than<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.970> normal<00:05:09.270> brake<00:05:09.449> pedal<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.960> it's<00:05:10.289> also

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
than a normal brake pedal and it's also

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.350 
than a normal brake pedal and it's also
a<00:05:10.590> lot<00:05:10.830> harder<00:05:11.039> that<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.639> push<00:05:11.849> this<00:05:12.090> gives

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
a lot harder that the push this gives

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.050 
a lot harder that the push this gives
you<00:05:12.419> better<00:05:12.599> feedback<00:05:13.139> and<00:05:13.320> better<00:05:13.470> feel

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
you better feedback and better feel

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.460 
you better feedback and better feel
generally<00:05:15.060> use<00:05:15.389> our<00:05:15.539> left<00:05:15.780> foot<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.050> break<00:05:16.259> and

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
generally use our left foot to break and

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.290 
generally use our left foot to break and
our<00:05:16.560> right<00:05:16.770> foot<00:05:16.949> to<00:05:17.159> to<00:05:17.580> use<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:17.729> throttle<00:05:18.120> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
our right foot to to use a throttle and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.360 
our right foot to to use a throttle and
and<00:05:18.479> don't<00:05:18.960> worry<00:05:19.110> about<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.409> clutch<00:05:19.650> clutch

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
and don't worry about the clutch clutch

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.180 
and don't worry about the clutch clutch
adjust<00:05:20.759> for<00:05:20.940> road<00:05:21.509> sections<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.320> just<00:05:23.070> for

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
adjust for road sections and just for

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.560 
adjust for road sections and just for
stopping<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.520> traffic<00:05:23.699> lights<00:05:24.000> otherwise<00:05:24.210> we

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
stopping the traffic lights otherwise we

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.200 
stopping the traffic lights otherwise we
don't<00:05:24.690> use<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.110> so<00:05:25.550> that's<00:05:26.550> that's<00:05:26.940> how<00:05:27.060> they

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
don't use it so that's that's how they

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.420 
don't use it so that's that's how they
work<00:05:27.449> but<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.289> hope<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.800> enjoyed<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.130> the

just<00:05:33.720> how<00:05:33.930> technologically<00:05:34.740> advanced<00:05:35.310> these

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
just how technologically advanced these

just how technologically advanced these
machines<00:05:36.000> are<00:05:36.270> from<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> outside<00:05:37.349> they<00:05:37.560> may

machines are from the outside they may

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.980 
machines are from the outside they may
look<00:05:37.919> similar<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.550> road<00:05:38.789> car<00:05:39.030> but<00:05:39.599> under<00:05:39.870> the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
look similar to a road car but under the

look similar to a road car but under the
skin<00:05:40.289> they're<00:05:40.710> anything<00:05:41.039> but
