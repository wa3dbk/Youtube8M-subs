track forward and that's basically going

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.730 
track forward and that's basically going

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.780 
to go through and track that part of my
arm<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.729> let's<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.090> give<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> second

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
arm so let's just give it a second

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.150 
arm so let's just give it a second
okay<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.660> once<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.260> tracking<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.800> done<00:01:27.830> you

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
okay so once the tracking is done you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.370 
okay so once the tracking is done you
can<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.610> scrub<00:01:29.030> through<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.600> see<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.170> your

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
can just scrub through and see that your

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.470 
can just scrub through and see that your
track<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.220> actually<00:01:31.370> good<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.150> that's

and then we're gonna draw another
exploit<00:01:48.560> which<00:01:48.800> will<00:01:48.980> create<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.280> second<00:01:49.910> layer

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
exploit which will create a second layer

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.480 
exploit which will create a second layer
so<00:01:51.020> I'm<00:01:51.110> gonna<00:01:51.230> click<00:01:51.500> on<00:01:51.560> explain<00:01:51.980> again<00:01:52.280> and

click a reference point and then I'm

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.490 
click a reference point and then I'm
just<00:03:25.790> gonna<00:03:25.970> start<00:03:26.030> painting<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.989> out<00:03:27.200> so

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
just gonna start painting that out so

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.920 
just gonna start painting that out so
we're<00:03:28.010> gonna<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.550> really<00:03:28.850> kind<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.600> rough

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
we're gonna do this really kind of rough

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.699 
we're gonna do this really kind of rough
I'm<00:03:30.709> not<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.400> good<00:03:31.730> at<00:03:31.880> Photoshop<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:33.260> let's

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
I'm not that good at Photoshop but let's

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.680 
I'm not that good at Photoshop but let's
just<00:03:33.859> see<00:03:34.220> how<00:03:34.579> this<00:03:34.760> goes

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.860 

okay<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.320> that's<00:03:40.770> not<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.280> best<00:03:41.730> job<00:03:42.210> but<00:03:42.780> if

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
okay so that's not the best job but if

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.600 
okay so that's not the best job but if
she<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.350> better<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:43.920> that's<00:03:44.160> okay<00:03:44.400> for

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
she can do better but that's okay for

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.460 
she can do better but that's okay for
this<00:03:44.700> tutorial<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.510> then<00:03:46.080> I'm<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.230> going<00:03:46.440> to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
this tutorial and then I'm just going to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.350 
this tutorial and then I'm just going to
go<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:46.950> save<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:47.730> just<00:03:47.760> click<00:03:48.060> file

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
go in and save that so just click file

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.990 
go in and save that so just click file
save<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:49.140> overwrite<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.950> file<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.940> then

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
save to overwrite that file and then

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.320 
save to overwrite that file and then
we're<00:03:51.780> gonna<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.050> back<00:03:52.080> into<00:03:52.590> mocha<00:03:53.460> Pro<00:03:53.700> so

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
we're gonna go back into mocha Pro so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.180 
we're gonna go back into mocha Pro so
back<00:03:54.570> into<00:03:54.870> mocha<00:03:55.140> Pro<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.620> gonna<00:03:55.830> make<00:03:56.010> sure

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
back into mocha Pro I'm gonna make sure

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.530 
back into mocha Pro I'm gonna make sure
that<00:03:56.220> I'm<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.700> same<00:03:56.940> frame<00:03:57.270> which<00:03:57.510> is

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
that I'm on the same frame which is

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.990 
that I'm on the same frame which is
frame<00:03:57.990> zero<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.640> bottom<00:03:59.760> I'm

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
frame zero and then at the bottom I'm

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
frame zero and then at the bottom I'm
going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.210> click<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.600> use<00:04:01.020> clean<00:04:01.380> plates

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
going to click this use clean plates

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.460 
going to click this use clean plates
exclusively<00:04:02.640> now<00:04:03.240> I<00:04:03.270> find<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.170> gives

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
exclusively now I find that this gives

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
exclusively now I find that this gives
me<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.860> best<00:04:05.130> results<00:04:05.250> but<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.850> can

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
me the best results but you can

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.520 
me the best results but you can
obviously<00:04:06.240> experiment<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.900> bit<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:07.350> what

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
obviously experiment a bit and see what

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.170 
obviously experiment a bit and see what
works<00:04:07.770> for<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.980> okay<00:04:08.490> then<00:04:08.730> you've<00:04:08.850> got<00:04:09.060> your

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
works for you okay then you've got your

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.210 
works for you okay then you've got your
illumination<00:04:09.930> model<00:04:10.320> which<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.710> either<00:04:10.890> non

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
illumination model which is either non

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.540 
illumination model which is either non
linear<00:04:11.820> or<00:04:12.150> interpolate<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.950> usually<00:04:14.130> use

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
linear or interpolate and I usually use

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.640 
linear or interpolate and I usually use
either<00:04:14.880> none<00:04:15.210> or<00:04:15.480> linear<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.200> gives<00:04:16.410> me<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
either none or linear that gives me the

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.320 
either none or linear that gives me the
best<00:04:16.799> results<00:04:16.980> but<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.670> can<00:04:17.790> obviously<00:04:17.880> also

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
best results but you can obviously also

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.940 
best results but you can obviously also
experiment<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.020> us<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.380> see<00:04:19.530> what<00:04:19.739> works

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
experiment with us and see what works

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.310 
experiment with us and see what works
the<00:04:20.130> best<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:21.060> for<00:04:21.420> this<00:04:21.510> shot<00:04:21.750> because<00:04:22.140> I'm

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
the best so for this shot because I'm

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.770 
the best so for this shot because I'm
rotating<00:04:22.740> my<00:04:23.010> arm<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.580> little<00:04:23.610> but<00:04:23.910> there's<00:04:24.690> a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
rotating my arm a little but there's a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.050 
rotating my arm a little but there's a
bit<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.020> illumination<00:04:25.560> change<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.370> my<00:04:26.610> arm<00:04:26.850> and

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
bit of illumination change on my arm and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.670 
bit of illumination change on my arm and
I'm<00:04:27.180> gonna<00:04:27.330> go<00:04:27.540> with<00:04:27.570> linear<00:04:28.110> for<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.500> one

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
I'm gonna go with linear for this one

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.010 
I'm gonna go with linear for this one
and<00:04:28.890> then<00:04:29.760> which<00:04:29.910> says<00:04:30.120> dissolve<00:04:30.600> I'm<00:04:30.840> gonna

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and then which says dissolve I'm gonna

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.320 
and then which says dissolve I'm gonna
set<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.590> blend<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.250> I'm<00:04:32.820> gonna<00:04:32.970> change

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
set this to blend and I'm gonna change

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.800 
set this to blend and I'm gonna change
the<00:04:33.600> dissolve<00:04:33.960> what<00:04:34.610> 220<00:04:35.610> that's<00:04:36.570> basically

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
the dissolve what 220 that's basically

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.200 
the dissolve what 220 that's basically
just<00:04:36.930> gonna<00:04:37.080> fade<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.740> nicely<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:38.820> us<00:04:38.940> and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
just gonna fade it in nicely for us and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.580 
just gonna fade it in nicely for us and
then<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.480> don't<00:04:39.660> have<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.900> enable<00:04:40.140> any<00:04:40.470> of

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
then you don't have to enable any of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.620 
then you don't have to enable any of
those<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.670> can<00:04:41.790> obviously<00:04:42.000> play<00:04:42.210> around<00:04:42.450> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
those you can obviously play around and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.930 
those you can obviously play around and
see<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.170> get<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:44.160> usually<00:04:44.670> get<00:04:44.790> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
see what you get but I usually get the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.390 
see what you get but I usually get the
best<00:04:45.120> results<00:04:45.630> using<00:04:45.960> either<00:04:46.190> nonlinear<00:04:47.190> and

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
best results using either nonlinear and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.260 
best results using either nonlinear and
then<00:04:47.880> blend<00:04:48.180> with<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.570> twenty<00:04:49.290> dissolve<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:50.910> I'm

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
then blend with a twenty dissolve so I'm

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.390 
then blend with a twenty dissolve so I'm
gonna<00:04:51.390> go<00:04:51.600> ahead<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.830> click<00:04:53.220> this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
gonna go ahead and you can click this

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.090 
gonna go ahead and you can click this
button<00:04:53.610> your<00:04:54.030> render<00:04:54.690> forward<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.950> will

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
button your render forward and this will

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.040 
button your render forward and this will
basically<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.460> render<00:04:56.910> through<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.780> use

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
basically just render through and use

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.710 
basically just render through and use
that<00:04:58.260> one<00:04:58.500> clean<00:04:58.770> plate<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.520> remove<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.270> too

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
that one clean plate to remove that too

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.690 
that one clean plate to remove that too
from<00:05:01.320> your<00:05:01.590> shot<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.010> let's<00:05:02.190> go<00:05:02.310> ahead<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.490> do

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
from your shot so let's go ahead and do

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.290 
from your shot so let's go ahead and do
that

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.270 

okay<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.289> render<00:05:06.560> is<00:05:06.620> complete<00:05:06.650> I'm<00:05:07.160> just

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
okay so the render is complete I'm just

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.070 
okay so the render is complete I'm just
gonna<00:05:07.370> switch<00:05:07.550> off<00:05:07.849> the<00:05:08.060> overlay<00:05:08.449> so<00:05:08.810> go<00:05:09.020> to

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
gonna switch off the overlay so go to
