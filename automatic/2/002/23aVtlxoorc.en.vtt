00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
card is Rayo necklace this is the first

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.190 
card is Rayo necklace this is the first
holo<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> list<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> colors

necklace<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.170> green<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> bubble<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
necklace is green in this bubble and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.969 
necklace is green in this bubble and
then<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> background<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:58.469> clouds

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
then the background is you know clouds

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.880 
then the background is you know clouds
of<00:01:59.369> purple<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.420> blue<00:02:00.689> rings<00:02:01.469> around

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of purple and then blue rings around

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.539 
of purple and then blue rings around
those<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.909> cool<00:02:03.210> looking<00:02:03.390> artwork<00:02:04.549> number

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
those a very cool looking artwork number

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.529 
those a very cool looking artwork number
five<00:02:05.759> card<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.360> Simha<00:02:06.719> seer<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.759> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.360> look

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
five card is Simha seer and if you look

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.029 
five card is Simha seer and if you look
really<00:02:09.750> close<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.500> there's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> geyser

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
really close looks like there's a geyser

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.940 
really close looks like there's a geyser
back<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.760> shooting<00:02:12.180> off<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.690> then

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
back here shooting off and then

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.949 
back here shooting off and then
see<00:02:14.160> masseur<00:02:14.459> has<00:02:14.700> flames<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> way

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
see masseur has flames all the way

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.620 
see masseur has flames all the way
around<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.590> thought<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.250> cool

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
around it I thought that was really cool

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.740 
around it I thought that was really cool
so<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:18.810> basically<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.800> card

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so that's basically I like this card

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.140 
so that's basically I like this card
number<00:02:21.750> four<00:02:21.959> card<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> Emboar<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.940> like

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
number four card is Emboar and I like

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
number four card is Emboar and I like
the<00:02:24.270> holographic<00:02:24.690> pattern<00:02:25.349> on<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.130> goes

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the holographic pattern on here it goes

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.699 
the holographic pattern on here it goes
from<00:02:26.489> orange<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> black<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.840> orange<00:02:28.170> again<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
from orange to black to orange again and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.100 
from orange to black to orange again and
then<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.390> semister<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> like

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
then I like just like semister I like

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.150 
then I like just like semister I like
the<00:02:31.230> flames<00:02:31.500> coming<00:02:31.830> out<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.220> Emboar<00:02:34.160> number

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the flames coming out from Emboar number

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.229 
the flames coming out from Emboar number
three<00:02:35.430> card<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.970> zekrom<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:38.190> lot<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
three card is zekrom and a lot of the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.300 
three card is zekrom and a lot of the
holographic<00:02:39.780> cards<00:02:40.200> from<00:02:40.380> some<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.130> black

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
holographic cards from some of the black

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
holographic cards from some of the black
and<00:02:41.459> white<00:02:41.550> sets<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.840> holographic

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and white sets have this holographic

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.290 
and white sets have this holographic
pattern<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.069> included<00:02:44.400> Zekrom<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.120> here

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
pattern but I included Zekrom in here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.059 
pattern but I included Zekrom in here
just<00:02:45.450> because<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.959> an<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.260> black<00:02:46.500> book<00:02:46.890> when

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
just because it's an all black book when

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
bit but it has these tiles or basically

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.240 
bit but it has these tiles or basically
they<00:02:52.769> are<00:02:52.799> one<00:02:53.250> two<00:02:53.519> three<00:02:53.549> four<00:02:53.880> five<00:02:54.360> six<00:02:55.250> six
