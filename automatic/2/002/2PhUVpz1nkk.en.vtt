00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
without any kind of sweetener it's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.749 
without any kind of sweetener it's
pretty<00:01:23.369> bitter<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> chocolate

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pretty bitter so so in the chocolate

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399

making<00:01:27.000> process<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:27.960> actually

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
making process what you would actually

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.289 
making process what you would actually
do<00:01:28.650> you'd<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.520> beans<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
do you'd get all of these beans out and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.620 
do you'd get all of these beans out and
every<00:01:30.570> single<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> them<00:01:32.150> one<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> pods

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
every single one of them one of the pods

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
every single one of them one of the pods
has<00:01:34.049> probably<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.590> 20<00:01:35.220> beans<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.939> you'd<00:01:36.390> get

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
has probably about 20 beans so you'd get

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
has probably about 20 beans so you'd get
a<00:01:36.630> whole<00:01:36.960> bunch<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
a whole bunch out and put them in really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
a whole bunch out and put them in really
big<00:01:39.270> boxes<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> wooden<00:01:40.229> crates<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.009> got

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
big boxes of wooden crates and it's got

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
big boxes of wooden crates and it's got
a<00:01:41.280> mesh<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> top<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.720> mesh<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
a mesh on the top and a mesh on the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920 
a mesh on the top and a mesh on the
bottom<00:01:43.670> what<00:01:44.670> happens<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> put<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:45.720> all

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
bottom what happens is that put them all

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
bottom what happens is that put them all
in<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.799> pulp<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.640> takes<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.030> few<00:01:48.210> days<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in and this pulp it takes a few days to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
in and this pulp it takes a few days to
disintegrate<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.380> actually<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.920> completely

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
disintegrate and actually all completely

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.020 
disintegrate and actually all completely
wear<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> seep<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.290> it'll<00:01:52.409> seep<00:01:52.710> out

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
wear off and seep out so it'll seep out

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.910 
wear off and seep out so it'll seep out
from<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.210> inch<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.049> mesh<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.799> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
from one inch into the mesh then you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
from one inch into the mesh then you
turn<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> box<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> it'll<00:01:57.390> seep<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
turn the box over and it'll seep out the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.880 
turn the box over and it'll seep out the
next<00:01:58.229> in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
next in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.260 
next in
and<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.360> you'd<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.380> out

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and and then you'd get all of them out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.580 
and and then you'd get all of them out
just<00:02:03.270> onto<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> road<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.200> were<00:02:04.260> literally

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
just onto the road we were literally

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.850 
just onto the road we were literally
driving<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.580> we<00:02:05.760> saw<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.330> these<00:02:06.660> beans<00:02:07.020> on

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
driving and we saw all these beans on

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.490 
driving and we saw all these beans on
the<00:02:08.070> road<00:02:08.369> being<00:02:08.700> been<00:02:09.360> dried<00:02:09.720> sun-dried<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the road being been dried sun-dried so

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
the road being been dried sun-dried so
it<00:02:10.590> takes<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.280> days<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.730> full

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it takes about three days for the full

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.270 
it takes about three days for the full
process<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.500> you're<00:02:14.040> probably

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
process and so you you're probably

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.910 
process and so you you're probably
familiar<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.910> cacao<00:02:15.840> beans<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.710> can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
familiar with cacao beans that you can

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.330 
familiar with cacao beans that you can
get<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.790> can't<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.240> UK<00:02:18.660> or<00:02:18.900> us<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:20.100> four

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
get and you can't in UK or us just four

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.220 
get and you can't in UK or us just four
already<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.090> actually<00:02:21.270> just<00:02:21.630> crunch

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
already so you can actually just crunch

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.650 
already so you can actually just crunch
in<00:02:22.410> them<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.830> when<00:02:23.040> they're<00:02:23.250> dried<00:02:23.660> they're

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
in them so when they're dried they're

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.750 
in them so when they're dried they're
really<00:02:25.110> really<00:02:25.410> tough<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> next<00:02:26.520> thing

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
really really tough so the next thing

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.850 
really really tough so the next thing
you<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.480> you'd<00:02:27.750> Craig<00:02:28.080> them<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you would do is you'd Craig them and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.000 
you would do is you'd Craig them and
you'd<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.310> cacao<00:02:29.730> nibs<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.860> are

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you'd get cacao nibs but if you are

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.760 
you'd get cacao nibs but if you are
actually<00:02:32.250> eating<00:02:32.700> them<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.450> their<00:02:34.050> own<00:02:34.230> right

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
actually eating them on their own right

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually eating them on their own right
out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> pod<00:02:35.430> completely<00:02:35.970> fresh<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
out of the pod completely fresh the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.020 
out of the pod completely fresh the
texture<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.320> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.280> soaked<00:02:39.209> almonds

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
texture is kind of like soaked almonds

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120 
texture is kind of like soaked almonds
so<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.330> next<00:02:42.630> stage<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.500> process<00:02:43.770> what

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
so the next stage in the process what

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.130 
so the next stage in the process what
you're<00:02:44.280> probably<00:02:44.520> most<00:02:44.970> familiar<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you're probably most familiar with is

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.400 
you're probably most familiar with is
cacao<00:02:47.100> powder<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.570> give<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.320> would

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
cacao powder and to give that you would

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.150 
cacao powder and to give that you would
literally<00:02:49.770> extract<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.410> powder<00:02:52.709> which<00:02:53.010> is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
literally extract the powder which is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.180 
literally extract the powder which is
your<00:02:53.280> cacao<00:02:53.610> solids<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.020> beans<00:02:55.260> away

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
your cacao solids out of the beans away

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.610 
your cacao solids out of the beans away
from<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> cacao<00:02:56.880> butter<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
from the cacao butter and the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
from the cacao butter and the
consistency<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> pretty<00:02:59.400> much<00:02:59.459> about<00:02:59.730> 50/50

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
consistency is pretty much about 50/50

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.820 
consistency is pretty much about 50/50
and<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.750> actually<00:03:00.870> see<00:03:01.320> what<00:03:01.560> cacao

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and you can actually see what cacao

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.259 
and you can actually see what cacao
powder<00:03:02.040> looks<00:03:02.340> like<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.610> another<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.060> my

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
powder looks like in another one of my

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.009 
powder looks like in another one of my
videos<00:03:03.600> which<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.190> roar'd<00:03:05.330> dark<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.660> white

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
videos which is roar'd dark and white

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.470 
videos which is roar'd dark and white
chocolate<00:03:07.200> covered<00:03:07.650> strawberries<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.820> and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
chocolate covered strawberries and and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.600 
chocolate covered strawberries and and
their<00:03:09.720> use<00:03:09.930> cacao<00:03:10.260> powder<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:10.799> well<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
their use cacao powder as well and you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.880 
their use cacao powder as well and you
can<00:03:11.640> actually<00:03:12.060> tell<00:03:12.330> as<00:03:12.480> well<00:03:12.720> when<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.140> when

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.660 
it's raw the color of the cacao powder
is<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.320> lot<00:03:16.530> lighter<00:03:16.890> because<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.340> hasn't<00:03:17.519> been

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
is a lot lighter because it hasn't been
