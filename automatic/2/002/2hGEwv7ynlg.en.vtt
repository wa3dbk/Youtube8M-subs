00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you use a map to build off of if you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
you use a map to build off of if you
want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> again<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.430> hundred

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
want to it again it's one hundred

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
want to it again it's one hundred
percent<00:00:32.730> optional<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.079> right<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.350> we're

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
percent optional so right here we're

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
percent optional so right here we're

and<00:03:06.819> pallets<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.660> you've<00:03:07.810> got<00:03:07.930> sandbags<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
and pallets and you've got sandbags to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.220 
and pallets and you've got sandbags to
then<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:10.060> course<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.540> have<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.720> well<00:03:10.930> right<00:03:11.200> here

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
then of course we have a well right here

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.410 
then of course we have a well right here
for<00:03:12.130> getting<00:03:12.340> water<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.790> stuff<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.299> well

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
for getting water and stuff the well

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.600 
for getting water and stuff the well
super<00:03:13.810> simple<00:03:14.170> you've<00:03:14.799> got<00:03:14.980> some<00:03:15.160> trim<00:03:15.400> pieces

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
super simple you've got some trim pieces

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.210 
super simple you've got some trim pieces
that's<00:03:15.940> 45<00:03:16.330> degree<00:03:16.600> inclines<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.890> create<00:03:18.100> kind

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that's 45 degree inclines to create kind

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.830 
that's 45 degree inclines to create kind
of<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.370> cylinder<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.239> you've<00:03:19.420> got<00:03:19.630> an

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
of a cylinder here then you've got an

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.229 
of a cylinder here then you've got an
antenna<00:03:20.320> small<00:03:20.650> which<00:03:20.920> which<00:03:21.700> would<00:03:21.880> ideally

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
antenna small which which would ideally

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.420 
antenna small which which would ideally
be<00:03:22.390> hooked<00:03:22.660> up<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> bucket<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.400> some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
be hooked up to a bucket so you get some

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.310 
be hooked up to a bucket so you get some
water<00:03:24.760> out<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.299> well<00:03:25.329> right<00:03:25.660> there<00:03:25.870> so

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
water out of the well right there so

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080 
water out of the well right there so
this<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.739> simplistic<00:03:27.280> western<00:03:27.880> town

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
could download this and build off of it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.270
