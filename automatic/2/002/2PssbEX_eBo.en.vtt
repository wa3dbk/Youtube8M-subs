he's a nice lad and an aerial it's
frustrating<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.550> intriguing<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.410> if<00:02:18.560> you're

a Shakespeare fan you sort of your
immediately<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.970> guess<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.150> aerial<00:02:23.480> side<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
immediately I guess on aerial side a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.080 
immediately I guess on aerial side a
little<00:02:23.960> bit<00:02:24.080> because<00:02:24.350> he's<00:02:24.800> recognizable<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
little bit because he's recognizable and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.880 
little bit because he's recognizable and
you<00:02:26.240> know<00:02:26.390> him<00:02:27.010> um<00:02:28.660> yes<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.930> there<00:02:30.590> isn't<00:02:30.800> much

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
you know him um yes I there isn't much

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.390 
you know him um yes I there isn't much
more<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.220> say<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.850> but<00:02:32.240> also<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.620> plot<00:02:34.070> was

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
more to say really but also the plot was

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.450 
more to say really but also the plot was
good<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.360> does<00:02:36.260> take<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> little<00:02:36.770> while<00:02:37.070> at

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
good it does take a little while at

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.120 
good it does take a little while at
first<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.000> realize<00:02:38.209> what<00:02:38.830> exactly<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.950> going

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
first to realize what exactly is going

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.190 
first to realize what exactly is going
on<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.860> setting<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> rules<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.420> this

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
on the the setting and the rules of this

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.949 
on the the setting and the rules of this
world<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.770> man<00:02:46.250> chaps<00:02:46.490> created<00:02:47.000> are<00:02:47.720> quite

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
world that man chaps created are quite

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.650 
world that man chaps created are quite
quite<00:02:48.440> out<00:02:48.620> there<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.610> takes<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.209> little

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
quite out there so it takes a little

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.750 
quite out there so it takes a little
while<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.800> gist<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.160> what's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
while to get the gist of what's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.940 
while to get the gist of what's
happening<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.300> how<00:02:53.450> things<00:02:53.630> work<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.770> then

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
happening and how things work but then

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.590 
happening and how things work but then
once<00:02:55.160> you're<00:02:55.400> there<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:56.330> let

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
once you're there you just you just let

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.660 
once you're there you just you just let
yourself<00:02:56.720> enjoy<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.350> ride<00:02:57.530> when<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.489> leave

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
