00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 like yesterday and today already 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.160
 I would like to announce that, of course 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.710
 again today five us team 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 Introduce compatible apps and tricks 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.330
 This time, two are free and three are 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 are chargeable and of course 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.929
 We also have an app here today 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.130
 Variation and I would start saying 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 we directly with this video 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 First, I want you the app 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.149
 backup imagine 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.100
 this is here on the second 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.780
 side of my homescreen and I open 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 Just let this app be free 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 unfortunately not yet available 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
 to the iphone 5 display thus to the 4 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.829
 inch display but also actually 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 irrelevant to the feature what this with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 because that brings us backups 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 We can do ours from the tricks 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.579
 and apps we have installed and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 we can just get backup here 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 and this is now secured here and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.730
 when we get our device back 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.830
 make and then jailbreak again 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 Can we just tweak this or 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.520
 click to install this app again 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.400
 on restore and all our files 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 will be reinstalled so really 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.479
 pretty handy so it will be one 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.509
 make a list of them and become them 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 then in backup really great I think 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.060
 Pretty cool 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.650
 you have to do this after you have this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.119
 have installed in any case first 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.479
 once in itunes backup make it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.700
 No apps etc from apple or 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.470
 also generally available from the app store 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 but it really only becomes backup 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 the studios and apps in this backup 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 involved and accordingly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.049
 would then have a normal backup with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 to do itunes 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.680
 Next I want to fulda you 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 customizer also presents for free 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.189
 available in Cydia and it is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.470
 maybe even my folder here 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 is red and even if I open this 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 then we have a red picture here 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.420
 rest and background and I think so 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.189
 looks pretty cool in any case 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.719
 class out of that can be in the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.670
 We change attitudes 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.619
 in the settings then see below 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.360
 at the psycho tricks folder customizer 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.520
 can here once the background then 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 the label background the text or too 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.560
 the window background so the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 superfluous part probably not the apps 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 but are just this part 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.910
 showing the homescreen again 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.590
 change and we just click 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 on the whole then just one 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.070
 in activate and educate with these 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 sleitan accordingly the strength of 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.570
 Add individual colors and easy 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.300
 look at 1 then select at the end 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.010
 must then also for kleibrink and then 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.690
 Looks like this you have 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.760
 here this folder and could this 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.220
 just open it and then see this 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 changed design the next war 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 is called eickeloh clamp costs 3 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.730
 dollar and she may already see it 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.740
 that there are several apps here in the series 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.230
 that means I have five apps here 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.270
 and can also down five apps 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.550
 place and that can be through 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.870
 Among other things , we stop these wars 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.700
 once you can go to the setting and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.260
 shows you what else is possible 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.550
 I think it's a bit like GÃ¼nter 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 unfortunately not quite as many 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.840
 That's why you should be fine 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.910
 Think about buying your first masterpiece 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.350
 What I would rather recommend would be us 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.630
 can change the layout here once 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.220
 and then add extras here and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.390
 the special thing is that we are here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.640
 Layout for the individual pages 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.080
 can change and we will come with that 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880
 usually does not bring three we can 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.090
 not now if that is often page 1 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.340
 x is deviated 4 and 5 on patch 3 2 x 3 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.250
 and accordingly, that is practical 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.860
 your particular patterns here then 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.330
 through your icons can customize around then 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.430
 For example, to install widgets 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.930
 or that your background image is something 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.680
 could see better so the apps that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 do not obscure 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.130
 and that's pretty much already 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.930
 practically, however , it offers just 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.209
 not quite as many features as 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.290
 example jumps at 13 in the end you have to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.630
 if you have changed that then 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860
 once click on floors below and 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.610
 then it will be accordingly 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.560
 adapted as well as selected it 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.060
 next two tweaks bit on itself 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.290
 the lockscreen you can do it 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 actually quite good I see show 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.940
 you first racer klop you see here 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.530
 over my clock that is still up here 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.910
 my weather will get displayed once 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.590
 for my place about the normal 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.570
 location services and then here the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.430
 temperature as it is currently around like 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.320
 she will be as we will 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.320
 here are shown small clouds and that 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.430
 means that currently is with me 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.739
 and it does not look at me either 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.630
 especially nice out there so that 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.830
 that is definitely true here and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.630
 I think that looks pretty handy 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.300
 In any case costs pretty cool 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.320
 a dollar in cydia to the settings 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.340
 I'll come right now because I want you 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.950
 once the next trick 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.410
 imagine work block 7 for 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.660
 a dollar 50 and you look at the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.370
 both sides that I still here each 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.380
 have a time stand once for 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.120
 Paris and once for Los Angeles 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.440
 and that is quite beside it here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.030
 simply also in the settings 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.680
 set which different ones 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.760
 You still have to see the times there 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.620
 I want this one is here now 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.000
 Small stream is located on the city I 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.130
 selected in other cities 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.620
 It looks better then or at 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.870
 shorter names accordingly fits that 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.310
 because still reasonable and I like 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.840
 personally is actually pretty good 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.039
 a nice extension for the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.360
 lockscreen and I'll show you now 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.190
 just do it again the setting we 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.060
 have to 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.070
 to look at first the 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.900
 water features to all settings 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.940
 we have to activate that and we can 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.979
 then here the interval just times 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.169
 select the respective hours so 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.430
 not too big 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.180
 setting options and wÃ¶rth 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.740
 knock 7 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.419
 do you have the possibility here the left one 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.479
 and right-click and there are there 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.530
 So many choices 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.300
 You can go up and down 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.740
 scroll that is split into the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.760
 So continents are also right 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.710
 good to find 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.740
 In addition, you can then the individual 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.110
 Watch one more name eg only one 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.669
 and two o'clock or just one 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.770
 depending on how you want to do that 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.510
 So it's on the side up 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.800
 fits like los angeles for example 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.110
 that not quite fit because you could 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.180
 simply all or anything else 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.310
 enter so that then fits or 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.580
 any other custom text you like 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.810
 would like to do that were the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.520
 I like you tricks today 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.289
 I wanted to introduce you 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.300
 Either way recommend apps backup too 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.770
 install it is also free of charge 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.750
 There is another alternative that is better 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.640
 is namely xp from but costs money 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.200
 and is not yet compatible to 7 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.200
 that's why you should first open 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.380
 this free incompatible variant 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.849
 change clock better and world Klopp 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.260
 eleven personally started me both very much 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.830
 I think it's great for the lockscreen 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.910
 and that's why I can only recommend 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.680
 of course again the question to you 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.940
 what do you think of this felix leave it 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.260
 to know me below in the comments 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.820
 I would be very interested 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.080
 if you liked the video and 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.580
 if the tricks have fallen 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.169
 can you like this video one 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.150
 thumb up you can give me in 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.340
 subscribe to my channel on facebook 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.050
 follow twitter and google + and then 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.370
 thank you for watching and would 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.730
 Say, see you in the next video 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.730
 again
