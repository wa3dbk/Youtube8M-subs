interesting<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.170> look<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.500> at<00:02:33.710> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
interesting is we look at this at the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.960 
interesting is we look at this at the
bottom<00:02:34.190> here<00:02:34.340> I'm<00:02:34.460> sure<00:02:34.610> don't<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:34.850> if<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
bottom here I'm sure don't know if you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.030 
bottom here I'm sure don't know if you
can<00:02:35.120> see<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.300> or<00:02:35.450> not<00:02:35.630> but<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.380> looks<00:02:36.980> like

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
can see it or not but is that looks like

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.140 
can see it or not but is that looks like
a<00:02:37.130> spell<00:02:37.370> factory<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.030> likely<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:40.090> maybe<00:02:41.090> I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
a spell factory and likely a maybe I

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.820 
a spell factory and likely a maybe I
could<00:02:41.360> dark<00:02:41.600> spell<00:02:41.840> factory<00:02:42.230> because<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.560> it

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
could dark spell factory because the it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.400 
could dark spell factory because the it
doesn't<00:02:43.160> look<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.490> same<00:02:43.520> as<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.910> normal<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.480> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
doesn't look the same as a normal one so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.410 
doesn't look the same as a normal one so
you<00:02:45.740> know<00:02:45.860> who<00:02:46.070> knows<00:02:46.100> there<00:02:46.760> could<00:02:46.790> easily<00:02:47.030> be

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you know who knows there could easily be

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.250 
you know who knows there could easily be
a<00:02:47.450> second<00:02:48.170> or<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.370> dark<00:02:49.370> spell<00:02:49.610> factory

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
a second or a dark spell factory

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260 
a second or a dark spell factory

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
like that in there you've got to figure

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.700 
like that in there you've got to figure
at<00:02:57.800> least<00:02:57.830> one<00:02:58.400> probably<00:02:58.880> two<00:02:59.210> news<00:03:00.140> fails<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.460 
but I really think this one's going to
this<00:03:20.180> one's<00:03:20.390> going<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.600> be<00:03:20.660> something<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.170> is

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
this one's going to be something that is

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.160 
this one's going to be something that is
