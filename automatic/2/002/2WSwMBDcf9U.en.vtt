00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello I'm elvia fÃ©lix right now I'm going to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.339
 teach another way to pamper your 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.339
 skin with injury 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 one of the ways to indulge and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.440
 relax your skin is to take that time 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 for you who is better with a face mask 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.910
 this chlorophyll mask is going to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.529
 serve to tighten your skin to improve 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.450
 blood circulation and therefore 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 have a younger skin I'm going to 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.079
 talk about three ingredients of this 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 wonder one of them is the aloe that 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.460
 it is an ingredient so that everyone 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.440
 we already know that it is very linked to what it is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.860
 beauty another of them is chlorophyll 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.480
 which has a great anti-inflammatory power 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.550
 for the skin like when you have prayed 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.859
 protects from free radicals and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.079
 it is also anti-aging what better 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.969
 that that to feel one day that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 we're as tired and apply this 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.140
 The most practical mask is to reach 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.839
 relax apply the mask as per 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.420
 about 10 minutes you go to bed you relax 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.579
 so that it works on your skin and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.989
 good and clean can enter the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 you can clean it in the shower 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.770
 I'm going to show you a bit of the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.770
 texture so that they go collection 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.299
 this is the mask I want to show you 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.680
 a little texture look like the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.110
 very liquid green chlorophyll is a gel 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.799
 apart it smells fabulous that also you 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.799
 help you relax 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.690
 what I'm going to do is apply it to me 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.160
 hand so you can see the texture and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.900
 how they run and how it is handled you grab what 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.060
 you take with a stick with a teaspoon 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.430
 to avoid putting your hand and that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.430
 contaminate the product you apply 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.260
 it's a gel if you can see it 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.260
 quite watery 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.580
 it's a mask that I love how 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.320
 smell that also helps you relax 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.090
 we can also apply it in 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.790
 limbs of the body as for example 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.190
 the hands the feet because not the neck 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.110
 the shoulders the neckline what yes them 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.300
 I recommend it is to remove it with warm water 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.860
 you may apply it before 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.470
 bathe so you do not fight in your 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 shower because if you want to apply or 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.180
 remove nothing else with a napkin 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.220
 it's going to be a bit complicated but this 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.870
 It's going to help your skin stay a lot 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.360
 cleaner is going to make you an effect 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 lifting for example if you want a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 party is very important you can 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.590
 apply before and your skin will look like 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590
 new 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.900
 and since I do not have a shower here what 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.860
 I'm going to do is remove it with a 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.860
 napkin with water 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.570
 a little warm water 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 I look for my napkin 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.360
 and I start to withdraw it in movements 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360
 circular 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.599
 here we see how the skin looks cleaner 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.879
 it looks more uniform you see that shine it 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.920
 see this facelift that we do imagine in 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.900
 the skin in the area in the area of 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.250
 cheekbones in the forehead area where yes 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.900
 You're going to have a party, it 's so 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.420
 fabulous that you can put it to a 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.459
 meeting who want to look good for that 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.360
 better than this chlorophyll mask 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.360
 to consent you
