hi its xbox guide again this is how to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.749 
hi its xbox guide again this is how to
make<00:00:03.600> weights<00:00:04.049> for<00:00:04.440> small<00:00:05.310> weights<00:00:05.490> for

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
make weights for small weights for

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.049 
make weights for small weights for
fishing<00:00:06.089> cinco's<00:00:06.919> wacky<00:00:07.919> rigged<00:00:08.340> or<00:00:08.580> Texas

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
fishing cinco's wacky rigged or Texas

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.360 
fishing cinco's wacky rigged or Texas
rigged<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.540> use<00:00:09.900> weight<00:00:10.230> eighty<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.099> ninety

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
rigged I use weight eighty to ninety

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.190 
rigged I use weight eighty to ninety
percent<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> time<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.300> get<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.719> lower

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
percent of the time to get that lower

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
percent of the time to get that lower
down<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.860> where<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> fish<00:00:14.490> are<00:00:14.730> quickly<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.350> I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
down to where the fish are quickly so I

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
down to where the fish are quickly so I
can<00:00:16.590> make<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:16.920> casts<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> put<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> lure<00:00:17.970> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
can make more casts and put the lure in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.910 
can make more casts and put the lure in
front<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> more<00:00:18.539> fish<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.080> helps<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:19.710> catch

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
front of more fish that helps me catch

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.410 
front of more fish that helps me catch
more<00:00:20.130> fish<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> don't<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> overpower<00:00:21.240> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
more fish you don't want to overpower it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.960 
more fish you don't want to overpower it
so<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> light<00:00:22.020> weight<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> key<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.730> is

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
so a light weight is key so what I do is

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.839 
so a light weight is key so what I do is
I<00:00:24.090> cut<00:00:24.330> off<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.779> pinched<00:00:25.769> end<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.640> see

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I cut off the pinched end so you can see

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.450 
I cut off the pinched end so you can see
the<00:00:27.000> hole<00:00:27.380> then<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.470> turn<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> cutters<00:00:29.099> around

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the hole then I turn the cutters around

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.420 
the hole then I turn the cutters around
so<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> flat<00:00:30.029> end<00:00:30.269> faces<00:00:31.019> towards<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> end<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so the flat end faces towards the end so

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700 
so the flat end faces towards the end so
now<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> piece<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.510> hollow<00:00:33.750> core<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
now you have a piece of hollow core that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.090 
now you have a piece of hollow core that
is<00:00:34.770> flat<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.550> both<00:00:35.630> sides<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.649> take<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is flat on both sides then I take the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.780 
is flat on both sides then I take the
cutter<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.120> cut<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:40.320> angle<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:41.640> make

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
cutter and I cut on an angle to make

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.569 
cutter and I cut on an angle to make
kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.149> conical<00:00:42.450> shape<00:00:42.890> if<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> clip<00:00:44.280> into

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
kind of a conical shape if you clip into

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.990 
kind of a conical shape if you clip into
the<00:00:44.610> hole<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.590> did<00:00:46.980> cut<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> end<00:00:47.820> off

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the hole like I just did cut the end off

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
the hole like I just did cut the end off
again<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.899> smaller<00:00:49.170> you're

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
again make it a little smaller you're

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
again make it a little smaller you're
going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> variety<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.489> sizes<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
going to have a variety of sizes so you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to have a variety of sizes so you
just<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> clip<00:00:52.860> parts<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
just go around and you clip parts of it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
just go around and you clip parts of it
off<00:00:53.879> until<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> make<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.110> conical<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.739> want

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
off until you make it conical you want

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.770 
off until you make it conical you want
it<00:00:56.160> conical<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> slip

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it conical you don't you want it to slip

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
it conical you don't you want it to slip
through<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> fish's<00:00:58.440> lips<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.309> set<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
through the fish's lips when you set the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.810 
through the fish's lips when you set the
hook<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.010> interfere<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
hook and not you know interfere with a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
hook and not you know interfere with a
hook<00:01:02.969> set<00:01:03.500> that's<00:01:04.500> why<00:01:04.769> most<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.430> books<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
hook set that's why most one books are

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630 
hook set that's why most one books are
conical<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
conical and so that's how you do it and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.500 
conical and so that's how you do it and
this<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> about<00:01:09.840> between<00:01:11.060> 1/32<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.150> one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this is about between 1/32 and one

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.080 
this is about between 1/32 and one
sixty-fourth<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.650> ounce<00:01:14.119> some<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.240> bigger

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
sixty-fourth of an ounce some are bigger

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.039 
sixty-fourth of an ounce some are bigger
some<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.390> smaller<00:01:20.450> depends<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.780> deep

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
some are smaller depends on how deep

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
some are smaller depends on how deep
you're<00:01:22.259> fishing<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.979> deeper<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.460> fish<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you're fishing the deeper your fish the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179 
you're fishing the deeper your fish the
more<00:01:24.299> weight<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> fish<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> your

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
more weight the if you fish in your

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.999 
more weight the if you fish in your
current<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.090> weight<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:28.229> don't

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
current you need some weight I don't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
current you need some weight I don't
fish<00:01:29.400> weightless<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.329> often<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:30.869> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
fish weightless very often when if it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
fish weightless very often when if it's
shallow<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> fish<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.939> really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
shallow and the fish want you really

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
shallow and the fish want you really
want<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:33.869> I'll<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.619> that's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
want that then I'll go to that so that's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380 
want that then I'll go to that so that's
how<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> mix<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.310> weights<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> use

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
how you mix some weights you can use

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
how you mix some weights you can use
these<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.750> drop<00:01:36.930> shots<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
these for drop shots I I can use a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
these for drop shots I I can use a
pretty<00:01:38.759> long<00:01:39.360> wait<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.720> drop<00:01:40.140> shot<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.560> I'm

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
pretty long wait for drop shot if I'm

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.020 
pretty long wait for drop shot if I'm
fishing<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.159> shore<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.549> want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.909> out

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
fishing on shore and I want to get out

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940 
fishing on shore and I want to get out
there<00:01:42.210> where<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> fish<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.560> current

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
there where the fish are on a current

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.889 
there where the fish are on a current
break<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.490> deeper<00:01:44.790> water

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
break out in deeper water
