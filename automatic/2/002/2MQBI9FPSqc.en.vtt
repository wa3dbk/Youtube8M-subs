00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
round edges right here okay and then it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
round edges right here okay and then it
goes<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.070> straight<00:01:32.460> right

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
to use the joystick you just use the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.520 
to use the joystick you just use the
middle<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.299> there<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
middle of right there and if you have to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.759 
middle of right there and if you have to
use<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.950> d-pad<00:02:59.459> use<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.510> far<00:03:00.750> left<00:03:01.049> nub<00:03:01.320> and

use the d-pad use the far left nub and

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.310 
use the d-pad use the far left nub and
just<00:03:02.160> picture<00:03:02.430> here<00:03:02.610> perfectly<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.600> it's

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
just picture here perfectly and it's

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.229 
just picture here perfectly and it's
just<00:03:04.590> an<00:03:04.680> all-around<00:03:04.950> perfect<00:03:05.670> controller

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
just an all-around perfect controller

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.729 
just an all-around perfect controller
and<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.900> probably<00:03:07.200> would<00:03:07.410> have<00:03:07.470> been<00:03:07.560> with

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and this probably would have been with

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.280 
and this probably would have been with
my<00:03:07.890> favorite<00:03:08.489> controller<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.110> reason

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
my favorite controller but the reason

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.140 
my favorite controller but the reason
why<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
why it's not it's because of the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.270 
why it's not it's because of the
joystick<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:13.320> all<00:03:13.440> know<00:03:13.650> about<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.070> ghost

controllers<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.980> I've<00:03:49.130> actually<00:03:49.240> warm

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
controllers because I've actually warm

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.630 
controllers because I've actually warm
out<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.840> mean<00:03:51.530> these<00:03:51.680> actually<00:03:52.190> will<00:03:52.400> fall

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
out I mean these actually will fall

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.760 
out I mean these actually will fall
apart<00:03:53.000> these<00:03:53.660> are<00:03:53.900> jurisdiction<00:03:54.500> right<00:03:54.620> here

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770

Debbie will cleanse you can just do this
shake<00:03:57.110> it<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:57.590> you'll<00:03:57.950> see<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.250> joystick

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
shake it and you'll see the joystick

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.240 
shake it and you'll see the joystick
flipping<00:03:59.240> all<00:03:59.360> over<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.750> place<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.320> it<00:04:01.040> was<00:04:01.190> a

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
flipping all over the place and it was a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.650 
flipping all over the place and it was a
big<00:04:01.400> flaw<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.060> design<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.450> this

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
big flaw in the design of this

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.060 
big flaw in the design of this
controller<00:04:03.080> they<00:04:03.530> did<00:04:03.680> not<00:04:03.710> make<00:04:04.040> that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
controller they did not make that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.160 
controller they did not make that
joystick<00:04:04.700> thick<00:04:04.970> enough<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.480> was<00:04:05.630> not<00:04:05.810> durable

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
joystick thick enough it was not durable

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.140 
joystick thick enough it was not durable
enough<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.460> brings<00:04:07.610> me<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.970> my<00:04:08.090> next

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
enough and that brings me to my next

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.630 
enough and that brings me to my next
controller<00:04:08.810> which<00:04:09.560> is<00:04:09.740> my<00:04:09.890> favorite

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
controller which is my favorite

controller of all time I have not met a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
controller of all time I have not met a
