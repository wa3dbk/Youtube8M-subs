00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.130
 street look at the world but excessively 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.949
 caring father does not allow households 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 leave the shelter investigated the surrounding 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.829
 the world because of chief paternal rule 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.829
 all new is trouble therefore the belt is always 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.530

 the walls of the cave it is hardly possible on 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.720
 help fidget comes trouble 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.570
 you should all see it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 need to enter there a toon named givve 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 Russia voiced singer nyusha for which 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.010
 participation in the project has become a kind 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:24.960
 exam dubbing is a little different 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:29.040
 action is another job first 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.560
 emotional turn and if you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.130
 suitable parameters let's say 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 voice timbre voice need to do 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.750
 right mood right 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.000
 character and proper energy 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.920
 surely it's fire and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.920
 it is fire and it is fire and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.720
 strong and athletic girls play yourself 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.360
 it turned out to be a joy 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.050
 Nyusha even added gip traits 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.700
 peculiar to the Russian soul attempt and all 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.950
 so say the truth is the problem of communication 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.080
 generations came to the fore in 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.410
 cartoon picture shown 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.090
 uneasy relationship of the daughter with the father 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.950
 viewing for the whole family will become and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.800
 entertainment and science 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.709
 case with a friend is not easy to understand it 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.230
 concern as a father is that if 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.470
 love or just want your child from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.870
 just protect him, I think it 's 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.650
 quite normal relations with the daughter of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.050
 which you fought useful to watch 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.840
 from the side and draw from this 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:03:04.660
 any lesson well maybe even 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:06.070
 learn how sam i'll figure it out can 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.310
 tell about one of my favorites 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.850
 examples of what i call creative 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 unions 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.860
 between me and the directors chris and pickaxe 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.200
 they came up with a scene 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.930
 which happens to something like a friend 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.329
 nervous breakdown due to what he sees 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.900
 as the hero of the district takes universal 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.760
 attention to the family all forgot a little about him 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.670
 because ryan and all such 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.920
 charming and resourceful and here 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.820
 groups also trying to show their 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.220
 ingenuity 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.769
 developing some kind of stone technique 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.590
 centuries coming up with different names and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.730
 suddenly starting to talk like you books 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.850
 50s 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.940
 I don't know where it came from but 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.500
 somehow this development 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.140
 inspired me 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.330
 this improvisation itself just came out by 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.790
 fluke in advance so not 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.280
 think it over just feel and 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
 act fall and if not fit then 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.510
 then not used and if you like 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.490
 they take off cream and so to speak 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.010
 insert the best into the cartoon and to 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.230
 happiness for all of us crosses give Kirk 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.690
 your freedom really tastes with them 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.420
 beautiful in the cartoon rise 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.500
 such important issues as fear of risk and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.739
 evolution 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.260
 a key message to the viewers love the version and 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.460
 do good in this story can be found 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.040
 a large number of 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.060
 questions raised besan or just 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.350
 survive 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.340
 and live life to the full 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.840
 name the main purpose of the cruise family 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.500
 the climax the meeting of gip and 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.610
 gaia 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.030
 this is where the most interesting begins 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.760
 need to leave 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:52.140
 doomsday is near why why now 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:56.850
 stand disappear I called it the end of the roots 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:01.320
 holding together who are your two days when 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.540
 the first time I auditioned for sound 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.500
 I had a completely different idea 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.200
 loss he was much higher studied much 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.540
 softer compared to how became 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.540
 look and ironic animated 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.330
 option so it all ended so that 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.900
 we decided to completely lower her timbre 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.760
 voices most interesting work with 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.190
 voice acting was to keep track of the pace and and for 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.650
 when shooting is almost finished you 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.080
 see how trouble she jumps frolic 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.990
 it helped me to live my own 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.310
 senses so here at this sad 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.220
 grow old and voice 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.060
 and I just imagined what she was 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.790
 must be 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.730
 Well, of course I looked original 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:50.820
 version of the cartoon and I realized that this 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:53.760
 girl savage I asked myself what I 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.930
 would if then lived and said herself 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.300
 i must be savage and talk 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.300
 in such a voice 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:13.310
 so of course I changed my voice 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.379
 because as a singer it was me 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.780
 make it a snap 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:20.629
 the continuation of this grand history 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.530
 let's see but for now nyusha is thinking over 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:28.009
 creating your own script is the same 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:30.259
 just start almost all start and 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.669
 because they are cavemen 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.180
 there is a whole revolution behind evolution and and 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:39.259
 cities and the ice age can be done 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.069
 some travel 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:46.729
 maybe in plo on the ocean maybe in 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:48.680
 the depths of the earth maybe they can build 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.259
 some ship or to climb 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.319
 up to take off to fly to 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.819
 another planet we need so that is 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.639
 have a very good fantasy to 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.729
 present the most interesting move 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:05.539
 events preklyucheniya name in the movie and we 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:11.270
 categorically demand the continuation of what 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:13.900
 this is such a fire try to hide from 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.900
 him all
