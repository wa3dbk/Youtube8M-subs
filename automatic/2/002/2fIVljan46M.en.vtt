original trophy which also comes with a

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.339 
original trophy which also comes with a
set<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:20.139> like<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.930> thought<00:03:23.170> I

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
set is just like this but I thought I

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.320 
set is just like this but I thought I
could<00:03:23.379> extend<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> little<00:03:24.400> by<00:03:25.209> using

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
could extend it a little by using

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.780 
could extend it a little by using
just<00:03:26.720> by<00:03:26.870> knocking<00:03:27.200> about<00:03:27.260> herpes<00:03:30.490> to<00:03:31.490> make<00:03:31.640> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
just by knocking about herpes to make it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.080 
just by knocking about herpes to make it
a<00:03:31.850> little<00:03:32.000> bigger<00:03:33.730> yeah

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
a little bigger yeah

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.690 
a little bigger yeah
also<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.840> could<00:03:35.990> just<00:03:36.260> if<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.340> want<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.610> build

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
also you could just if you want to build

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.570 
also you could just if you want to build
him<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:37.970> could<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:38.270> do<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:40.190> clip<00:03:40.430> it

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
him you could just do that and clip it

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.600 
him you could just do that and clip it
on<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.910> think<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.270> looks<00:03:41.450> better<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:43.340> other<00:03:43.370> way

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
on I think it looks better the other way

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.120 
on I think it looks better the other way
though<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.120> one<00:03:44.330> looks<00:03:44.510> kind<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:45.430> small<00:03:46.430> so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.460
