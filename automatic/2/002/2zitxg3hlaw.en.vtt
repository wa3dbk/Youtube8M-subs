obviously buying the torsos is that

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
obviously buying the torsos is that
obviously<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.479> buy<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:49.200> throws

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
obviously if I was to buy these throws

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.270 
obviously if I was to buy these throws
Indiana<00:01:50.909> Jones<00:01:51.240> tosses<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.990> brick<00:01:52.229> link<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Indiana Jones tosses from brick link it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
Indiana Jones tosses from brick link it
would<00:01:53.450> every<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> buy<00:01:55.530> safe<00:01:55.829> eight

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
would every way it was to buy safe eight

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
would every way it was to buy safe eight
eight<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> nine<00:01:58.049> ten<00:01:58.850> torsos<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.119> cost<00:02:00.479> me<00:02:00.750> say

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
eight to nine ten torsos it cost me say

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.030 
eight to nine ten torsos it cost me say
25<00:02:02.579> 30<00:02:03.000> squared<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
25 30 squared which is just it's just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.389 
25 30 squared which is just it's just
too<00:02:05.250> much<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.610> spend<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.149> torsos<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
too much to spend on torsos so I just

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
too much to spend on torsos so I just
thought<00:02:08.610> why<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.660> waterslide<00:02:10.229> decal

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
thought why don't you waterslide decal

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.949 
thought why don't you waterslide decal
then<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> lot<00:02:11.370> cheaper<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:12.480> spend<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
then it's a lot cheaper you spend the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.670 
then it's a lot cheaper you spend the
same<00:02:13.140> amount

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
same amount

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119 
same amount
for<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.950> paper<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.180> spray<00:02:15.719> and<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.769> you

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
for the paper and spray and then you

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.640 
for the paper and spray and then you
obviously<00:02:17.609> get<00:02:18.299> more<00:02:18.540> figures<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.349> so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
obviously get more figures out of it so

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.420 
obviously get more figures out of it so
yeah<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:21.420> also<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.950> German

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
yeah and then also with the German

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.789 
yeah and then also with the German
figure<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.629> mg42<00:02:25.349> machine<00:02:25.680> gun<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
figure you have the mg42 machine gun the

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.429 
figure you have the mg42 machine gun the
lethal<00:02:28.799> German<00:02:29.340> armory<00:02:29.989> then<00:02:30.989> you've<00:02:31.170> also

well so if you have any ideas of more
more<00:02:58.879> more<00:02:59.879> ideas<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.569> like<00:03:02.689> custom<00:03:03.689> ideas<00:03:04.079> for

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
more more ideas of like custom ideas for

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.240 
more more ideas of like custom ideas for
for<00:03:07.790> me<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.060> make<00:03:09.269> I'm<00:03:10.079> sure<00:03:10.560> I'll<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:11.010> able<00:03:11.129> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
for me to make I'm sure I'll be able to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.080 
for me to make I'm sure I'll be able to
make<00:03:11.459> them<00:03:11.819> because<00:03:12.060> obviously<00:03:13.459> if<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.790> send

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
make them because obviously if you send

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.319 
make them because obviously if you send
me<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.359> decal<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:17.370> then<00:03:17.699> print<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:18.599> off<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
me the decal I can then print it off and

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.969 
me the decal I can then print it off and
print<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.449> off<00:03:21.569> onto<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.019> waterslide<00:03:22.409> decal

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
print it off onto the waterslide decal

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.250 
print it off onto the waterslide decal
paper<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:24.299> obviously<00:03:24.479> put<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.049> on<00:03:25.139> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
paper and then obviously put it on the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.030 
paper and then obviously put it on the
torso<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.949> there<00:03:26.129> you'll<00:03:26.819> have<00:03:26.879> your<00:03:27.180> figure

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
torso and there you'll have your figure

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.330 
torso and there you'll have your figure
so<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.599> don't<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:31.319> where<00:03:31.889> do<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.129> want

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
making in the region of 20 of these guys

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.860 
making in the region of 20 of these guys
I<00:04:07.430> mostly<00:04:08.430> not<00:04:08.669> going<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.909> need<00:04:09.090> all<00:04:09.389> of<00:04:09.419> them

I mostly not going to need all of them
so<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.040> future<00:04:11.280> maybe<00:04:12.049> that<00:04:13.049> path<00:04:13.379> may

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
so in the future maybe that path may

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.009 
so in the future maybe that path may
lead<00:04:13.709> us<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.280> selling<00:04:14.639> some<00:04:14.849> of<00:04:14.879> these<00:04:15.030> guys<00:04:15.329> so
