00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
variant and so he actually looks

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.160 
variant and so he actually looks
different<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> gaming<00:00:21.420> doesn't<00:00:21.930> just

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
different in the gaming doesn't just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.259 
different in the gaming doesn't just
look<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.100> figure<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> lot

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
look different as the figure like a lot

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
look different as the figure like a lot
of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> variants<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> alright<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.010> go

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of the variants do alright so let's go

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
of the variants do alright so let's go
ahead<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> look<00:00:26.460> at<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> stats<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.090> regular

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
ahead and look at the stats for regular

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
ahead and look at the stats for regular
bumble<00:00:27.930> blast<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.680> see<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.039> he<00:00:29.279> looks

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
bumble blast so we can see what he looks

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.050 
bumble blast so we can see what he looks
like

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
like

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.380 
like
so<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> starts<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.219> 320<00:00:32.219> max<00:00:32.489> health<00:00:32.759> 35

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so we starts off at 320 max health 35

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
so we starts off at 320 max health 35
speed<00:00:33.780> 24<00:00:34.380> armor<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> critical<00:00:35.640> hit

right<00:00:39.809> zolly<00:00:40.200> bulma<00:00:40.469> blast<00:00:40.739> has<00:00:41.100> 360<00:00:41.879> max

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
right zolly bulma blast has 360 max

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
right zolly bulma blast has 360 max
health<00:00:42.360> 47<00:00:43.260> speed<00:00:43.559> 39<00:00:44.280> armor<00:00:44.760> critical<00:00:45.719> hit<00:00:45.899> an

health 47 speed 39 armor critical hit an
elemental<00:00:47.250> power<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> same<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:48.420> 4<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> 25

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
elemental power are the same at 4 and 25

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
elemental power are the same at 4 and 25
so<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> looks<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.309> gets<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> boost<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so it looks like he gets a boost on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.459 
so it looks like he gets a boost on
three<00:00:51.180> different<00:00:51.449> things<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> being<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
in the second upgrade is hungry bees

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
in the second upgrade is hungry bees
bees<00:01:40.290> deal<00:01:40.560> increased<00:01:41.159> damage<00:01:41.369> against<00:01:41.850> honey

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
bees deal increased damage against honey

bees deal increased damage against honey
targets<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.590> let's<00:01:43.770> hunting<00:01:44.009> this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
targets all right so let's hunting this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.370 
targets all right so let's hunting this
up<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.579> we're<00:01:45.299> getting<00:01:45.390> nineteen<00:01:45.960> and

up and we're getting nineteen and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
up and we're getting nineteen and
instead<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> 17<00:01:47.640> before<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
instead of I think of 17 before and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.920 
like this and it should just target that
and<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.700> doesn't<00:02:57.030> seem<00:02:57.150> amount<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.480> damages

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and it doesn't seem amount of damages

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.690 
and it doesn't seem amount of damages
before<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.470> stirred<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.010> nest<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.490> new

before it stirred up a nest a new

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.150 
before it stirred up a nest a new
bazooka<00:03:00.270> now<00:03:00.510> shoots<00:03:00.930> even<00:03:01.320> more<00:03:01.470> bees<00:03:01.740> that

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
bazooka now shoots even more bees that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.000 
bazooka now shoots even more bees that
do<00:03:02.310> increase<00:03:02.700> damage<00:03:03.110> okay<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:04.740> my

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
do increase damage okay so if you see my

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
do increase damage okay so if you see my
bazooka<00:03:05.400> got<00:03:05.670> bigger<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.840> regular

they're doing 19 and with the honey
let's<00:03:16.320> see<00:03:16.560> what<00:03:16.770> would<00:03:16.830> they<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.870> 24<00:03:19.470> now

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
let's see what would they do in a 24 now

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.190 
let's see what would they do in a 24 now
and<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:20.280> create<00:03:20.520> for<00:03:20.580> 36<00:03:21.210> all<00:03:21.930> right<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and they create for 36 all right the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.710 
and they create for 36 all right the
next<00:03:22.320> upgrade<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.980> queen<00:03:23.370> bee<00:03:23.670> holdin<00:03:24.450> charge
