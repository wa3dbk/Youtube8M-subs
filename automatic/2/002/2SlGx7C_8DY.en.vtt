00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
make like hundred grand a year okay but

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.290 
make like hundred grand a year okay but
guess<00:03:41.810> what<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:43.340> didn't<00:03:43.580> work<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:43.910> way

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
guess what it didn't work out that way

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.900 
guess what it didn't work out that way
and<00:03:44.510> part<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.650> was<00:03:45.800> he<00:03:46.160> didn't<00:03:46.400> do<00:03:46.489> research

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
and part of it was he didn't do research

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
the only thing I didn't like was when I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.910 
the only thing I didn't like was when I
went<00:04:01.760> there<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.209> had<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.600> deal<00:04:03.080> with<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.650> fact

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
went there I had to deal with the fact

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.500 
went there I had to deal with the fact
it<00:04:04.010> was<00:04:04.070> more<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.459> family<00:04:04.700> orientated

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
fireman and I didn't really like that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.830 
fireman and I didn't really like that
and<00:04:07.820> that's<00:04:07.910> something<00:04:08.209> I<00:04:08.360> should<00:04:08.390> have<00:04:08.720> did

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
and that's something I should have did

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.020 
and that's something I should have did
more<00:04:08.870> research<00:04:09.200> about<00:04:09.680> right<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:10.880> you've

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
more research about right so you've

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.180 
more research about right so you've
learned<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.290> just<00:04:12.500> stumble<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.070> you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
learned and you you just stumble and you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.680 
learned and you you just stumble and you
figured<00:04:13.550> out<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:13.970> didn't<00:04:14.180> walk<00:04:14.300> away<00:04:14.420> from

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
figured out but I didn't walk away from

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.390 
figured out but I didn't walk away from
a<00:04:14.810> really<00:04:15.290> good<00:04:15.470> job<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:15.920> walked<00:04:16.130> away<00:04:16.280> because

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
a really good job I walked away because

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
really wasn't making the money so I had

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.080 
really wasn't making the money so I had
to<00:04:21.109> do<00:04:21.260> something<00:04:21.710> and<00:04:22.450> this<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> thing

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
to do something and this is the thing

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.820 
to do something and this is the thing
