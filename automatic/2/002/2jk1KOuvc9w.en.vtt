00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.069
 he thinks 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.650
 everyone is wrong except me he intends 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 boiled down remember people said no we 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
 like even his party is now against 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.890

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.309

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:42.020
 the charm of a great power no george bush 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.229
