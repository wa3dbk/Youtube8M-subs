 Hamou recently that person something something and are addicted that very much in the personal computer 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.600
 It is you buy a personal computer at a pace of about difficulty 3 months 2 times 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 That 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.630

 We have gorilla cache now has a little cut Nde had entered name 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 It is necessary to basically say that there is no purpose to use that PC separately 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:19.920
 It seems that it does n't matter if the village does n't have such a spec . 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.970
 If you say that you have such a good PC once every two months 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.870
 Actually 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.370

 I understand combing softening flame or burns guy is what the numbers 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 If there Benchipan type Datte order PCs got 2000 yen a better path 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.570
 It is 3000 or so 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.610
