00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
want to gain muscle tone or I want to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.630 
want to gain muscle tone or I want to
increase<00:00:47.579> muscle<00:00:47.879> tone<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.390> whatever<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
increase muscle tone or whatever so

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
increase muscle tone or whatever so
first<00:00:50.640> things<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:50.969> what<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.050> really

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
first things first what do they really

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
first things first what do they really
mean<00:00:52.430> when<00:00:53.430> someone<00:00:53.730> says<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.329> me<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.510> will

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
mean when someone says that to me I will

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.290 
mean when someone says that to me I will
always<00:00:55.140> ask<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.890> break<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.820> exactly

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
always ask to break down how exactly

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.500 
always ask to break down how exactly
they<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> look<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> long<00:00:59.010> story<00:00:59.309> short

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
they want to look and long story short

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
they want to look and long story short
muscle<00:01:00.510> tone<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.190> not<00:01:03.350> something<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.680> do

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
muscle tone is not something that you do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850 
muscle tone is not something that you do
to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> muscle<00:01:05.430> per<00:01:05.670> se<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.500> muscle

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to the muscle per se it's how the muscle

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.969 
to the muscle per se it's how the muscle
looks<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.479> example<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
looks so for example what you have is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.590 
looks so for example what you have is
imagine<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.110> muscle<00:01:13.110> tissue<00:01:13.350> here

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
imagine that you have muscle tissue here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
imagine that you have muscle tissue here
what<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:15.840> layers<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.590> fat<00:01:17.119> over<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
what have these layers of fat over the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
what have these layers of fat over the
top<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.860> layers<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.310> fat

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
top if you have a lot of layers of fat

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.690 
top if you have a lot of layers of fat
you<00:01:21.360> won't<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.680> contours<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> muscle

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you won't see the contours of the muscle

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.050 
you won't see the contours of the muscle
underneath<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.560> example<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.580> someone<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
underneath so for example if someone is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
underneath so for example if someone is
obese<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.829> they<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> lot<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> abdominal

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
obese and they do a lot of abdominal

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.330 
obese and they do a lot of abdominal
work<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.229> increase<00:01:31.650> visible

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
work they will not increase visible

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
work they will not increase visible
muscle<00:01:32.670> tone<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.420> they've<00:01:33.570> simply<00:01:33.780> got

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
muscle tone because they've simply got

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859 
muscle tone because they've simply got
too<00:01:34.470> much<00:01:34.710> fat<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.579> stomach<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.630> not

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
too much fat on their stomach it's not

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.130 
too much fat on their stomach it's not
until<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.560> lose<00:01:37.890> fat<00:01:38.340> where<00:01:39.329> muscle

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
until they lose fat where muscle

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.679 
until they lose fat where muscle
definition<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:41.009> muscle<00:01:41.460> tone<00:01:41.729> becomes<00:01:42.390> more

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
definition a muscle tone becomes more

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.319 
definition a muscle tone becomes more
visible<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.159> someone's<00:01:44.490> asking<00:01:44.729> about

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
visible so if someone's asking about

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.120 
visible so if someone's asking about
muscle<00:01:45.720> tone<00:01:45.930> able<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> increase<00:01:46.500> muscle<00:01:46.799> tone

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
muscle tone able to increase muscle tone

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
muscle tone able to increase muscle tone
increase<00:01:47.399> muscle<00:01:47.640> definition<00:01:48.020> what<00:01:49.020> they

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
increase muscle definition what they

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.399 
increase muscle definition what they
really<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> fat<00:01:50.490> loss<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:52.140> clear

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
really mean is fat loss that's clear

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
really mean is fat loss that's clear
I'll<00:01:52.770> repeat<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.399> someone's<00:01:53.670> asking<00:01:53.820> about

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
I'll repeat if someone's asking about

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.959 
I'll repeat if someone's asking about
muscle<00:01:54.509> tone<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:55.170> they<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.350> need<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.490> fat

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
muscle tone what they really need is fat

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.440 
muscle tone what they really need is fat
loss<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.750> cannot<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:59.460> abs<00:01:59.759> you're

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
loss if you cannot see your abs you're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.319 
loss if you cannot see your abs you're
too<00:02:00.750> fat<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.250> simple<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.180> be

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
too fat it's that simple you have to be

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420 
too fat it's that simple you have to be
have<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.780> blunt<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.469> because<00:02:04.860> there

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
have to be blunt with this because there

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.560 
have to be blunt with this because there
are<00:02:05.520> people<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> doing

to see exactly what I mean so and
harpenden<00:02:34.680> calipers<00:02:35.340> skin<00:02:35.940> fold<00:02:36.150> caliper<00:02:36.210> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
harpenden calipers skin fold caliper to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.700 
harpenden calipers skin fold caliper to
measure<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.650> fat<00:02:37.950> beneath<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.640> skin<00:02:39.000> but

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
measure the fat beneath the skin but

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.410 
measure the fat beneath the skin but
subcutaneous<00:02:40.710> fat<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.640> does<00:02:41.850> not<00:02:42.090> measure

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
subcutaneous fat it does not measure

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.350 
subcutaneous fat it does not measure
this<00:02:43.020> or<00:02:43.260> or<00:02:43.410> fat<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.890> fat<00:02:44.370> around<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> organs

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
this or or fat I fat around the organs

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.560 
this or or fat I fat around the organs
so<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.320> fact<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.160> see<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.150> what

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
so this is fact that you can see so what

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.930 
so this is fact that you can see so what
I'm<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:48.990> find<00:02:49.800> your<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.010> slightly<00:02:50.430> cue

the full monty music go down to my gym
vest<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:58.280> let's<00:02:59.280> I'll<00:02:59.880> do<00:03:00.030> something<00:03:00.360> like

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
vest so let's I'll do something like

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.680 
vest so let's I'll do something like
biceps<00:03:01.650> rather<00:03:01.920> than<00:03:02.130> absurd<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.510> get

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
biceps rather than absurd not to get

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.720 
biceps rather than absurd not to get
topless<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> bit<00:03:04.530> weird<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:07.730> have

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
topless is a bit weird and so I have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.240 
topless is a bit weird and so I have
relative<00:03:09.500> relatively<00:03:10.500> good<00:03:10.740> arm<00:03:11.460> definition

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
relative relatively good arm definition

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.850 
relative relatively good arm definition
how<00:03:14.250> much<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:15.270> how<00:03:15.300> visible<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.350> muscles<00:03:16.710> are

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
how much or how visible the muscles are

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.490 
how much or how visible the muscles are
on<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.100> arms<00:03:17.490> comes<00:03:18.180> down<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.600> body<00:03:18.810> fat<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
on your arms comes down to body fat so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
on your arms comes down to body fat so
you<00:03:19.560> could<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:19.980> muscular<00:03:20.310> arms<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.330> if

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
you could have muscular arms but if

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000 
you could have muscular arms but if
you've<00:03:21.540> got<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:21.990> fat<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.350> top<00:03:22.710> you're

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
you've got a lot of fat on top you're

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.560 
you've got a lot of fat on top you're
simply<00:03:23.340> not<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.700> see<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> muscle<00:03:24.390> not

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
simply not going to see the muscle not

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.210 
simply not going to see the muscle not
see<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> muscle<00:03:25.140> contours<00:03:25.620> muscle<00:03:25.950> strain

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
see the muscle contours muscle strain

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.780 
see the muscle contours muscle strain
Asians<00:03:26.460> etc<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:28.650> i<00:03:28.830> take<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.220> example<00:03:29.310> my

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
Asians etc so if i take for example my

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.040 
Asians etc so if i take for example my
bicep<00:03:30.890> can<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.460> so<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.960> you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
bicep can you see that there so what you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.690 
bicep can you see that there so what you
do<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.230> skin<00:03:34.560> fold<00:03:34.770> caliper<00:03:34.830> I'll<00:03:35.400> do<00:03:35.550> this

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
do is skin fold caliper I'll do this

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.160 
do is skin fold caliper I'll do this
kind<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.060> i'm<00:03:36.240> going<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.540> one-hand<00:03:37.050> it

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
kind of i'm going to have to one-hand it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.750 
kind of i'm going to have to one-hand it
but<00:03:37.230> usually<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.710> would<00:03:37.830> be<00:03:37.950> two<00:03:38.160> handed<00:03:38.490> if<00:03:38.610> I

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
but usually it would be two handed if I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.910 
but usually it would be two handed if I
was<00:03:38.940> doing<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.390> client<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.320> what<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.710> do

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
was doing it to a client so what you do

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.760 
was doing it to a client so what you do
is<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:43.200> pinches<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.690> fat<00:03:45.690> underneath<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
is it pinches the fat underneath the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.670 
is it pinches the fat underneath the
skin<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.290> my<00:03:49.440> skin

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
skin so if you see that that is my skin

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.420 
skin so if you see that that is my skin
fold<00:03:49.920> measurement<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:51.240> roughly<00:03:51.920> two<00:03:52.920> point

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
fold measurement it's roughly two point

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.750 
fold measurement it's roughly two point
two<00:03:53.550> millimeters<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:55.170> if<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.740> had<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> lot<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.280> fat

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
two millimeters so if I had a lot of fat

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.300 
two millimeters so if I had a lot of fat
on<00:03:56.940> my<00:03:57.210> bicep<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.780> when<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> pinched<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.770> you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
on my bicep and when I pinched it you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580 
on my bicep and when I pinched it you
can<00:03:59.490> pinch<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.820> lot<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.210> fat<00:04:00.450> my<00:04:01.050> arms<00:04:01.350> would<00:04:01.410> not

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
can pinch a lot of fat my arms would not

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.230 
can pinch a lot of fat my arms would not
have<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.770> same<00:04:02.070> level<00:04:02.490> of<00:04:02.580> definition<00:04:03.150> not

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
have the same level of definition not

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.240 
have the same level of definition not
same<00:04:03.480> level<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.810> muscle<00:04:04.200> type<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
same level of muscle type this is the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.150 
same level of muscle type this is the
same<00:04:05.460> with<00:04:05.610> ABS<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.270> could<00:04:06.900> I'll<00:04:07.770> tell<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.040> what

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
same with ABS I could I'll tell you what

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.590 
same with ABS I could I'll tell you what
I'll<00:04:08.310> damage<00:04:08.490> it<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:08.970> it's<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.180> very<00:04:09.209> thin

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
I'll damage it because it's a very thin

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.150 
I'll damage it because it's a very thin
vest<00:04:09.870> I'll<00:04:10.050> demonstrate<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.740> on<00:04:10.950> apps

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.410 
vest I'll demonstrate this on apps
because<00:04:11.370> that's<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.760> one<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.000> most<00:04:12.150> people

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
because that's the one that most people

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.690 
because that's the one that most people
are<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.660> ask<00:04:12.780> about<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.560> I'll<00:04:14.550> go

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
are going to ask about so I'll go

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.479 
are going to ask about so I'll go
through<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.090> vest<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.620> abdominal

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
through the vest and so abdominal

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.180

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
for you to see them properly so to give

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.420 
for you to see them properly so to give
you<00:05:19.450> a<00:05:19.570> rough<00:05:19.840> measurement<00:05:20.350> on<00:05:20.500> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
you a rough measurement on the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.680 
you a rough measurement on the
abdominals<00:05:21.670> if<00:05:22.000> you're<00:05:22.120> pinching<00:05:22.420> next<00:05:22.630> to

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
abdominals if you're pinching next to

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.400 
abdominals if you're pinching next to
the<00:05:22.780> belly<00:05:22.960> say<00:05:23.260> here<00:05:24.420> for<00:05:25.420> me<00:05:25.630> someone<00:05:26.230> that's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
the belly say here for me someone that's

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.950 
the belly say here for me someone that's
got<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.740> say<00:05:26.950> is<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.400> decent<00:05:27.700> abs<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.540> looking<00:05:28.870> at

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
got to say is a decent abs is looking at

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.840 
got to say is a decent abs is looking at
that<00:05:29.080> ten<00:05:29.440> millimeters<00:05:30.130> that's<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.430> got<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.580> very

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
that ten millimeters that's a got a very

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.900 
that ten millimeters that's a got a very
rough<00:05:31.240> guide<00:05:31.800> everyone's<00:05:32.800> different<00:05:33.040> but<00:05:33.730> ten

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
rough guide everyone's different but ten

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.160 
rough guide everyone's different but ten
millimeters<00:05:34.420> tends<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:34.780> be<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.900> kind<00:05:35.020> of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
millimeters tends to be a kind of

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.710 
millimeters tends to be a kind of
ballpark<00:05:35.650> figure<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.730> like<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.360> say<00:05:37.510> if<00:05:37.570> you're

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
ballpark figure so like I say if you're

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.020 
ballpark figure so like I say if you're
grabbing<00:05:37.900> a<00:05:38.110> lot<00:05:38.320> there<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:39.670> don't<00:05:39.880> have

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
grabbing a lot there and you don't have

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.120 
grabbing a lot there and you don't have
this<00:05:40.150> well<00:05:40.360> apps<00:05:40.540> that's<00:05:40.960> why<00:05:41.260> no<00:05:41.740> amount<00:05:41.950> of

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
this well apps that's why no amount of

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.410 
this well apps that's why no amount of
crunches<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:42.700> going<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:42.970> burn<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.210> fat<00:05:43.360> away

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
crunches is going to burn the fat away

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.530 
crunches is going to burn the fat away
well<00:05:44.230> well<00:05:44.410> then<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.860> fat<00:05:45.010> away<00:05:45.040> is<00:05:45.550> dieting

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
well well then the fat away is dieting

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.810 
well well then the fat away is dieting
exercise<00:05:47.340> essentially<00:05:48.340> all<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.550> things<00:05:48.730> you

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
exercise essentially all the things you

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.960 
exercise essentially all the things you
do<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.030> lose<00:05:49.330> body<00:05:49.540> fat<00:05:49.630> so<00:05:50.640> there's<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.790> myth

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
do to lose body fat so there's the myth

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.810 
do to lose body fat so there's the myth
myth<00:05:52.540> of<00:05:52.690> toning<00:05:53.080> toning<00:05:53.620> doesn't<00:05:53.890> exist<00:05:54.250> what

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
myth of toning toning doesn't exist what

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.190 
myth of toning toning doesn't exist what
you<00:05:54.910> really<00:05:55.120> are<00:05:55.390> referring<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:56.020> is<00:05:56.170> a

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
you really are referring to is a

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040 
you really are referring to is a
decrease<00:05:56.680> in<00:05:56.710> body<00:05:56.920> fat<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:57.460> can<00:05:57.700> see<00:05:58.180> the

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
decrease in body fat so you can see the

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.580 
decrease in body fat so you can see the
muscle<00:05:59.410> tone<00:05:59.620> more<00:05:59.890> if<00:06:00.430> you<00:06:00.610> have<00:06:00.850> crap<00:06:01.150> abs

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
muscle tone more if you have crap abs
