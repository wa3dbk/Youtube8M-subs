from a distance that smaller fighters
just<00:00:30.300> can't<00:00:30.480> compete<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
just can't compete with but it is a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
just can't compete with but it is a
trade-off<00:00:32.219> because<00:00:32.550> those<00:00:32.820> smaller<00:00:33.180> fighters

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
trade-off because those smaller fighters

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
trade-off because those smaller fighters
get<00:00:33.780> more<00:00:33.930> explosive<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.739> they<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.920> inside

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
get more explosive when they get inside

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
get more explosive when they get inside
like<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> Mike<00:00:36.120> Tyson<00:00:36.149> sort<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> thing<00:00:37.020> and
