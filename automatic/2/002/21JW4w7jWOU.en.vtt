a whole load of brio out we've got an
electric<00:00:10.679> train<00:00:10.860> set<00:00:10.980> okay<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:11.880> here<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
electric train set okay so here is a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.200 
electric train set okay so here is a
conjugate<00:00:13.230> molecule<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.000> drug

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
conjugate molecule so there is a drug

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.109 
conjugate molecule so there is a drug
carrier<00:00:15.570> now<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.839> back<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.039> drug<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.880> in

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
carrier now the back and the drug is in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to swallow a conjugate medicine yeah it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.819 
to swallow a conjugate medicine yeah it
was<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.559> very<00:00:41.059> unscripted<00:00:42.500> yes<00:00:43.500> cinema

verite I guess and got to go to the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.690 
verite I guess and got to go to the
right<00:00:46.559> place<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.129> want<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.670> to

right place and we want this to go to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.799 
right place and we want this to go to
the<00:00:47.879> liver<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.329> time<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.559> entering

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
the liver this time so it's now entering

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.060 
the liver this time so it's now entering
circulation<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> turned

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
circulation and it's going to be turned

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.889 
circulation and it's going to be turned
around<00:00:53.250> oh<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.969> gone<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> wrong<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
around oh it's gone the wrong way and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
around oh it's gone the wrong way and
but<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> might<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.370> around<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but it might be going around the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
but it might be going around the
circulation<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.629> indeed<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.109> around

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
circulation is it is indeed going around

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.349 
circulation is it is indeed going around
the<00:00:58.379> circulation<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.520> once<00:00:59.789> again<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.149> gone

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the circulation but once again it's gone

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.710 
the circulation but once again it's gone
too<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.960> drug<00:01:01.170> has<00:01:01.320> been<00:01:01.500> wasted

good<00:02:58.390> outside<00:02:59.390> outside<00:03:00.250> what<00:03:01.250> I'm<00:03:01.340> talking

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
good outside outside what I'm talking

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.220 
good outside outside what I'm talking
about<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.730> I'm<00:03:01.909> looking<00:03:02.390> at<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.989> links

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
about is I'm looking at the links

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.899 
about is I'm looking at the links
between<00:03:03.459> polymers<00:03:04.629> polymer<00:03:05.629> chains<00:03:05.900> and

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
between polymers polymer chains and

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.880 
between polymers polymer chains and
chains<00:03:07.909> trains<00:03:08.629> and<00:03:09.019> also<00:03:09.379> how<00:03:09.560> these<00:03:09.739> systems

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
chains trains and also how these systems

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.619 
chains trains and also how these systems
might<00:03:10.220> actually<00:03:10.370> form<00:03:10.670> artificial<00:03:11.150> brains<00:03:11.390> so

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
might actually form artificial brains so

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.630 
might actually form artificial brains so
there's<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> bit<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:11.989> poor<00:03:12.920> rhyming<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.459> there

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's a bit of poor rhyming in there

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.539 
there's a bit of poor rhyming in there
and<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.120> wrote<00:03:14.329> in<00:03:14.510> my<00:03:14.660> son<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.410> who<00:03:15.650> six<00:03:16.010> to

in our special drug carrying system as
you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.409> see<00:03:33.590> there<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.280> worms

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
you can see there the can of worms

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.330 
you can see there the can of worms
actually<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.180> condensed<00:03:36.109> DNA<00:03:36.620> inside<00:03:37.040> a

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
to a delivery vehicle and what we're

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.869 
to a delivery vehicle and what we're
going<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.920> do<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.159> we're<00:03:43.310> going<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.549> give<00:03:43.700> the

going to do is we're going to give the
patient<00:03:44.269> gene<00:03:44.630> therapy<00:03:45.169> which<00:03:45.889> is

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
patient gene therapy which is

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.710 
patient gene therapy which is
significant<00:03:46.970> because<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.209> looked<00:03:47.389> like<00:03:47.510> his

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
significant because it looked like his

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.599 
significant because it looked like his
left<00:03:48.200> eye<00:03:48.349> has<00:03:48.500> shifted<00:03:48.889> quite<00:03:49.130> considerably

that's<00:04:05.660> research<00:04:06.079> for<00:04:06.379> you<00:04:06.470> that's<00:04:06.709> what

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
that's research for you that's what

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.650 
that's research for you that's what
happens<00:04:07.040> when<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.849> do<00:04:08.000> research<00:04:08.209> not

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
happens when you do research not

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.800 
happens when you do research not
everything<00:04:09.019> went<00:04:09.199> first<00:04:09.500> time

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.539 

as<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.959> can<00:04:15.079> see<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.409> is<00:04:15.590> set<00:04:16.220> out<00:04:16.250> for<00:04:16.489> a

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
as you can see it is set out for a

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.069 
as you can see it is set out for a
career<00:04:16.789> research<00:04:17.150> because<00:04:17.539> you<00:04:17.690> just<00:04:17.840> have<00:04:17.989> to

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
career research because you just have to

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.189 
career research because you just have to
keep<00:04:18.199> trying<00:04:18.729> okay<00:04:19.729> so<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> idea<00:04:20.780> there<00:04:21.169> is

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
keep trying okay so so the idea there is

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.140 
keep trying okay so so the idea there is
really<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.739> show<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:23.000> know<00:04:23.090> if

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
really just to show that you know if

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.550 
really just to show that you know if
you're<00:04:23.270> delivering<00:04:23.600> drugs<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.139> patient<00:04:24.470> is

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
you're delivering drugs to a patient is

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.950 
you're delivering drugs to a patient is
not<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.740> trivial<00:04:24.979> thing<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.400> do<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.360> they

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
not a trivial thing to do and that they

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.450 
not a trivial thing to do and that they
drugs<00:04:27.320> have<00:04:27.440> lots<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.800> different<00:04:28.099> routes<00:04:28.310> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
drugs have lots of different routes and

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
the lots of places where actually it can

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.659 
the lots of places where actually it can
go<00:04:30.560> wrong<00:04:30.800> when<00:04:31.190> you're<00:04:31.220> doing<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.550> research

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
go wrong when you're doing the research

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.850 
go wrong when you're doing the research

in<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.310> patient's<00:04:34.699> it's<00:04:34.820> clearly<00:04:35.060> not<00:04:35.710> going

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
in the patient's it's clearly not going

it's got to appeal to the to the top
prophesied<00:04:54.800> be<00:04:54.949> in<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.310> department<00:04:55.820> but<00:04:56.599> it's

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
prophesied be in the department but it's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.029 
prophesied be in the department but it's
you've<00:04:56.900> got<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.110> have<00:04:57.199> lightened<00:04:57.560> up<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.830> little

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
you've got to have lightened up a little

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.279 
you've got to have lightened up a little
bit<00:04:58.130> as<00:04:58.250> well<00:04:58.370> because<00:04:58.759> I<00:04:58.789> think<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.720> lot<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.169> the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
bit as well because I think a lot of the

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:01.960 
bit as well because I think a lot of the
science<00:05:00.650> you've<00:05:00.770> got<00:05:00.889> to<00:05:00.979> try<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.250> make<00:05:01.340> it's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
science you've got to try and make it's

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
science you've got to try and make it's
one<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.210> your<00:05:02.300> jobs<00:05:02.449> as<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.690> science<00:05:02.930> is

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
one of your jobs as the science is

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.150 
one of your jobs as the science is
trying<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.320> make<00:05:03.440> things<00:05:03.470> relevant<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.130> a

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
trying to make things relevant to a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.089 
trying to make things relevant to a
general<00:05:04.970> population<00:05:05.509> and<00:05:06.099> non-specialists

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
general population and non-specialists

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.529 
general population and non-specialists
certainly<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:08.000> what<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.180> want<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.389> try

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
certainly so that's what I want to try

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.640 
certainly so that's what I want to try
and<00:05:08.630> do<00:05:08.690> with<00:05:08.870> these<00:05:08.960> kind<00:05:09.199> of<00:05:09.259> things<00:05:09.349> it's

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
and do with these kind of things it's
