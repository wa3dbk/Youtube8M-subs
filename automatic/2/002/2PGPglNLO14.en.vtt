00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.339
 thank you 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.810
 Look I wanted if I could shorten it 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.640
 the beard chosen an existence the head is 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.739
 left they do it without success any more 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:45.010
 make peace because here it is here waiting 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:47.090
 he has never done a little short in short 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.269
 seen because the other time he never did 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:01:04.519
 however, after long and patient leave them 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:01:08.510

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.860
 all of the 40 here it is, but thanks, it's ok 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.710
 review see us arrived today vi 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.620
 we will explain how to build a key leader 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 for the guitar with simple things 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.560
 that we can find for home for 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.070
 example we could take a clothespin e 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.630
 then we got a rubber from one of 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.580
 these are not an accessory you need 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.140
 to rest the pot when it is hot 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.790
 so that the base does not ruin the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.600
 gum at it but you can 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 one from anywhere even I don't know one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 eraser as long as it is a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 child so that he adheres well to the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 handle of the guitar since it is a bit 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.180
 bent i'm sticking with it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 of the attack you can attack it 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 quietly as you see fit in 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.810
 I recommend attaching it from the most part 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.760
 roswitha at least that smooth join 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 well on the handle of the prodigal guitar 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.190
 as if the clothespin and this with the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 our path solofra attached for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.690
 now let's apply apply it to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.430
 guitar with an elastic band 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.430
 let's take a key our choice 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.350
 we put in correspondence of the football and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.819
 with an elastic band from below to above 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.849
 block the we forgive the third 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.430
 we already see that harsh guitar am 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.630
 perfectly that we have our boss 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.420
 key 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.220
 but it does not end here because the same 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.430
 right device 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.480
 yes yes in the same council we have both 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.340
 one end key is heard and the other end 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.930
 button also an ok tremolo 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.930
 here is the demonstration of the tremolo 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:18.019
 and what to say, this device is brilliant 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.959
 since we have two tools in one 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:29.930
 this is the tremolo and this is the leader 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:32.030
 key as you can see instead we have 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.750
 also thought to take one of those 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.510
 glue sticks that are used for 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.620
 precisely to the hot glue gun 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:46.010
 or even dictate hot and silicone 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.590
 this is this we can say that it is 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.579
 perfect because it is made of rubber so it is 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.480
 very malleable is enough 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.950
 resistant to adapt just fine to the 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.230
 handle of our guitar we support 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.620
 our one-button silicone boat 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.519
 at our choice and block it with a 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.419
 elastic from below to above and then to 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:15.889
 balance one another from above to 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:23.410
 below for safety we also put a 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:23.410
 another and here is a simple keystroke 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.040
 Yup 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.260
 the town as a chorister 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.889
 three goals 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.190
 ok it's done as done
