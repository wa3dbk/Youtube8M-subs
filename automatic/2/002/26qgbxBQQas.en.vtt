00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.810
 By the way, now every fifth Eickmeier Aldi is selling the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.730
 Spin prices seem to prevail in the discounters and it means 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.789
 very bad times for the brewers 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.400
 If you knew that at 9live, the games are transparent and fair 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.619
 understandable so at least SID the transmitter that way 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.720
 you already know 9live is the station that officially nobody looks at but 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340
 call alone in the last year about 20 million people and 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 have played with mach fern sense because the programmer but if 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.210
 Let's take a closer look at pixies and 9live puzzles 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.850
 could participate then shows only 1 transparent very incomprehensible 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 really seem 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.840
 Seers to be stretchable concepts 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.880
 Customers broadcast a heatwave 9 live in July which supposedly 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.210
 simple task they add all the numbers 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.470
 This appeals to Paul Trost from the vicinity of Limburg the learned 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.170
 Accountant was head of accounting in one 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 Midsize business numbers are its passion I have though 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 Urs Hofer Choo tried by area 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.950
 but I do not work 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.440
 b the result came 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.580
 I have the UK resolution 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.120
 more on the video Gallus showed you have seen 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.890
 and manageable and moreover could result in something far from mine 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.480
 Solutions way was because none of the over 200 callers made came too 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.719
 the 9live solution 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.190
 of 6500 74 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.740
 The game ran for four hours no wonder apparently also Roman 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.920
 Numbers to read backwards in the text that even about line breaks 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.930
 away and in others 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 for comfort an absurdity 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.930
 that in the quirky methods and what's going on 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.820
 Percent the people 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.880
 Animate to make tires and hid him unfortunately just routine but 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.680
 still high cross cells 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.860
 Percent, which numbers do not help solve the solution 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.130
 So I think that already is no longer the fixed that none already as 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.669
 illegal 9live rip-off with riddles without recognizable solutions 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.259
 This opinion is also Ulrich Geiger from Berlin 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.749
 like Peter Trost, he failed a few months ago on a new live 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.139
 Puzzles and wondered about the strange resolution since busy 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.529
 he makes extensive use of the self-proclaimed transmitter 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.589
 Import computer images and compares the results with the 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.109
 Task if you do not know the backgrounds with which 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.379
 flowing the tillage corp 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.550
 and tricks what to consider for something not funny it will be 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.029
 not transparent 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.289
 also rules are not explained the heat and about it from a day on 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.249
 the other changed today counts 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.029
 that did not want that 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.949
 In other games, there are different goals rules called for 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.419
 that the rules change the rule that a game so others 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 applied and vice versa 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.969
 the spectators will be on site and give 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.919
 ripped off 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.049
 Is it really true that 9live play me without any obvious solutions 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.069
 earned money 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.509
 to investigate this record as the program of a broadcast week 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.599
 a total of over 60 hours of material 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
 cutouts 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.489
 the formula 1 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.599
 in a little white ball are among themselves 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.019
 All of them actually none of the callers could have this supposedly simple ten 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:36.919
 have to play 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.429
 while they ran for several hours example of this riddle of tenth 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.559
 Come August they see all animals that's the simple question 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.589
 the supposed solution dubious 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:51.850
 SCN backwards read the words over all punctuation marks like here 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.889
 ants 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.939
 according to Maissen 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.939
 Below in the text one finds after 9live interpretation 89 Tigerhai 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:10.159
 151 animals are one animal +51 animals + 151 animals and also the word their total 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.539
 204 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:15.609
 and in addition to a team good, there are supposedly in addition to sixth before 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:21.559
 no word on this goal way at the nine live resolution at 2 o'clock at night 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.349
 only a number is displayed 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.789
 lets it go 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.870
 Example 2 broadcast on 13 made 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 If you draw all the letters, the task is who the text and the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.880
 Keyboard by counting only comes on 99 of the channels but presented after 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.740
 three hours of play mockingly a completely different result women 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.690
 highlight 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.979
 303 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.830
 because that's because of course, for example, synonymous with 3d see that too 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.830
 Danny on 4 has to see the 3D world 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.900
 logical 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.279
 to the 99 come after 9live gusto still two a3 d-4d 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.520
 but then you are still at 143 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.939
 in the word 9live ten additional 9 l 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.149
 in addition 50 the because the e stands for Roman 50 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.749
 another one is hiding here 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:23.489
 and because c Honisch wonders means in borsch to Dr allegedly still 100a too 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.279
 Find 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.279
 altogether the 103 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.469
 for me the solution is wrong 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.289
 because it's only ten all pop stars 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.620
 and that's why the solution of a 3 against their gets off the wrong track 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.820
 his rejoicing it is the solution of 9live but not the solution agreed with the 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.809
 Question should be reached 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.219
 if the players really are so transparent and that they are a normal one 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.999
 TV viewers can solve 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.879
 Hopefully they will not make these profits anymore 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.270
 in the sense of 9live 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.800
 the self-proclaimed Christan actually sent one off 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.139
 in the central Munich we want to ask why the games are like that 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.809
 intransparent and why the solutions are kept secret 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:12.569
 no answers in front of the camera the opinion only in writing one sees 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.289
 as an entertainment channel should count the fun and continue quote 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.639
 this includes the skill in solving and finding the 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.059
 Solutions to prove themselves 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:27.369
 for example, Roman numerals or the reverse ddp are for the 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.919
 find them in every recipe 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.919
 but the sender may just keep on watching over 9live for 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.509
 the Bavarian state center for new media 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.930
 Here we play the rides 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.479
 Everything is correct everyone has to know for themselves or on the matchdays 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.740
 it certainly makes sense to look at what games at the station 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.389
 be made 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.490
 or because they do not matter 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.399
 I agree 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:56.340
 Accountant Paul Trost could not solve the calculation until today 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.499
 and Plusminus could not help him despite detailed research 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.040
 9live had his band on television 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.969
 Clevergy now in magazines again 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.509
 because there he finds him the transparent solution
