that<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.850> looking<00:03:12.030> at<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.980> five<00:03:13.980> six<00:03:14.670> years

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
that I'm looking at it five six years

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.199 
that I'm looking at it five six years
ago<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:16.110> seemed<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.890> me<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.640> was<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
ago it seemed to me that that was the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.690 
ago it seemed to me that that was the
style<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.110> devolves<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.400> time

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700

style but that it devolves all the time
I<00:03:20.730> mean<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.299> involves<00:03:21.750> continued

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I mean it involves continued

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.960 
I mean it involves continued

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
but I was on the right direction and it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.640 
but I was on the right direction and it
took<00:03:28.150> me<00:03:28.390> about<00:03:28.540> three<00:03:28.599> years<00:03:28.900> after

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650
