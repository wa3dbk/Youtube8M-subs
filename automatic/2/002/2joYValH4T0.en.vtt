00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
for items in the toy box and as they do

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
for items in the toy box and as they do
collect<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> more<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.780> those<00:00:39.870> items<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
collect more and more of those items in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.729

interesting<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> even<00:00:45.360> wanted<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> give

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
interesting so I even wanted to give

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
interesting so I even wanted to give
them<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> nice<00:00:46.440> introduction<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> toy

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
them a nice introduction to what the toy

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.279 
them a nice introduction to what the toy
box<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> thought<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.170> may

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
box was and I thought that may

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
box was and I thought that may
potentially<00:00:49.670> also<00:00:50.670> introduce<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
potentially also introduce you some of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.119 
potentially also introduce you some of
the<00:00:52.050> features<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.680> might<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.980> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the features that you might have in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
the features that you might have in
Disney<00:00:53.370> infinity<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.210> haven't<00:00:54.719> actually

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
Disney infinity but haven't actually

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.430 
Disney infinity but haven't actually
delved<00:00:55.649> into<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.399> much<00:00:56.730> depth<00:00:57.090> yet<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.260> do

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
delved into in much depth yet so to do

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.830 
delved into in much depth yet so to do
this<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.770> set<00:00:58.949> ourselves<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.370> task<00:00:59.670> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.270> blank

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
this we set ourselves a task of a blank

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
this we set ourselves a task of a blank
slate<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> toy<00:01:01.590> box<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.430> wanted<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
slate in the toy box and we wanted to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
slate in the toy box and we wanted to
create<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> game<00:01:03.210> using<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> logic

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
create a game using a bit of logic

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
create a game using a bit of logic
connecting<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.820> toy<00:01:06.030> box

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
connecting some different toy box

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
connecting some different toy box
elements<00:01:06.630> together<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.170> create<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> game<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
elements together to create a game of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
elements together to create a game of
football<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.720> receptor

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
football so we have these two receptor

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
football so we have these two receptor
pads<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.010> we've<00:01:11.159> placed<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.030> that's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
pads that we've placed down and that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
pads that we've placed down and that's
where<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:13.170> big<00:01:13.380> beach<00:01:13.650> ball

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
where we have to get our big beach ball

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
where we have to get our big beach ball
into<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.939> have
