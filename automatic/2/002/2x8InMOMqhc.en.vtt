think it's a craftsman yeah the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
think it's a craftsman yeah the
carburetor<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.539> needs<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> clean

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
carburetor I think needs to be clean

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
carburetor I think needs to be clean
