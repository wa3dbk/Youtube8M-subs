00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 their maximum santucci today we talk about 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.150
 average or average rhythm so defined is one 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.539
 speed not easy to find 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.390
 because if you leave room for 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.660
 sensations often tend to be wrong 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.410
 originally this means of training 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.239
 should be taken to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 an intensity of about 85 percent 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.280
 compared to anaerobic threshold values ​​though 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.309
 in reality it is difficult to understand 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.519
 then a little at the level of sensations then 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.239
 it is good then to report it to some gaits 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.739
 when we have to make a reference 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.179
 lactic acid is what concerns the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.550
 tremors piers per liter 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.760
 which is also what we go to 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.059
 fish with half the ideal speed 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.309
 marathon for example in a subject who 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.030
 the sea runs a half marathon in 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.150
 an hour and a half and that is 415 per km 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 the 415 could be a gait of 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.160
 average pace differs by about 15 20 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.740
 seconds with respect to the anaerobic threshold 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.130
 this distance is a lot 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.650
 important to leave to keep why 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.540
 sometimes there are athletes who come to 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.340
 report I stopped during a 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.870
 I couldn't take it anymore 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.300
 and this is something that in theory is not 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.680
 possible because we are running a 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.770
 more intensity we say more limited 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.660
 compared to a voracity about 10,000 races 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.820
 so how come it stopped or is loaded 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.640
 the tender load from the sessions 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.340
 previous had not recovered or 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.220
 otherwise the problem lies in the non 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.690
 having identified the right pace 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.880
 of strength this medium can develop 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.119
 for a given mileage 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.060
 the one that goes from 78 kilometers to 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.610
 16 18 kilometers in general that one 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.930
 space where we run a medium is clear 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 that if you run for one 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.849
 a lower duration the conditioning 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.420
 that are obtained are limited 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.340
 if you go over 18 km if you go into one 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.040
 space that already concerns a rhythm 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.700
 even serious marathon and rhythm would go one 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 little revised the pace of the middle is 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.879
 useful for a lot of things because it goes 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 especially mizar and energy consumption 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.720
 and that's what it should do 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.760
 every kind of runner from the middle distance 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 resistant to pure strength 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.180
 also the runner who runs the 3000 ai 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 5000 meters must make enough use 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.769
 important of the middle is obvious that the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.579
 runner who makes 10 thousand up to 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.959
 half marathon is an extremely means 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.290
 effective training 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:12.359
 I would say that the session is medium 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:16.030
 where results are not obtained 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.790
 brilliant thanks to that medium but does yes 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.400
 which acts as a glue we tell others 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.889
 training means then it must be put inside 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.440
 a training facility where it is 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.709
 expected to be in the long run of 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.079
 resistance of both the average rhythm and the 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.810
 classic aerobic power workouts 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.340
 to raise we say the thresholds of 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.340
 work in the presence of oxygen
