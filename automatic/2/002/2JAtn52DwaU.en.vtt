 in Europe, similar seasonality is pronounced 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.630

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.530
 and even in those regions that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.450

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.440
 Drift is high art management 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.590
 by car we use it to 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.030
 learn to fully control 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.299
 car dynamics 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 if there is only a limit 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.229
 need to understand how can behave 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.280
 car adversity 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.159

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.520

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.880

 Interfax Natalia Shumkova 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.559
 not in place that way for a short period 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.379
 except that they were not that 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.779
 banned for now 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.960
 despite so impressive claws 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.070
 the driver is required to fully understand and 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.720
 precise movements to keep the car 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.089
 trajectories 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.039
 after all, while driving under Russia, the system 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.119
 stabilization off 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.399
 loss and recovery 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.439
 steps on slippery roads occur 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.799
 very quickly and can cause skidding or 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.169
 car turning 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.579
 but it is possible to avoid 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.559
 on the ice is very important to manage smoothly 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.429
 by car 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.119
 looking from the side it may seem that 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.819
 I'll be crazy in the wheel stalled machine 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.789
 there is a skid driver waiting for a reward 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.309
 but all this is done with a dosed out 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.579
 the driver must understand exactly which part 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.239
 charged car capacities 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.079
 he wants to release now 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.209
 all you need to do hours 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.369
 I will quote Walter pirates 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.589
 the more action i do with driving 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.389
 less can I push the pedals 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.299
 and vice versa 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.719
 here I add a lot of gas or tomas 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.540
 in the test drive should be this very 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.719
 economical 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.319
 the driver must always keep in 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.559
 balance your head 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.959
 where she died Estonian busy on 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.799
 really enough as well as 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.689
 all-wheel drive 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.169
 I just love the button belts on the GDP 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.449
 car behavior is changing 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.639
 fundamentally why 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.249
 pupils constantly me this one 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.249
 car but different 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.759
 you see how to press the modification group 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.459
 gunners 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.929
 pay attention to google turning front 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.199
 wheels to do the same 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.109
 rear wheel drive exercises and 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.019
 all-wheel drive versions from the driver 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.019
 completely different actions are required 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.929
 do not get carried away with games with excess 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.739
 car turns 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.409
 just press the letter on the gas 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.029
 correct driving directions 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.069
 drifts and you have already passed the next 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.489
 turn the ice track sideways 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 raise the air with whole families 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.419
 house 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.560
 in everyday driving is better not to disconnect 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.789
 system of sixth vice mayor 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.029
 we deciphered in jest 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.219
 abbreviation pfts markets please 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:23.699
 save me 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.069
 but here on the lake are inexpensive 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.580
 cars driving in one direction 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.110
 so nothing bad happens 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 can't court 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.869
 worst case driver waiting 

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:36.020
 small snowdrift on the side of the road 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.879
 who is the case nearby are on duty 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.340
 several end suvs 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 tow ropes 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.979
 if a lot of tests spend in the winter 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.089
 there is while you can graft 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:01.639
 first-class riding habits 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.099
 snow and ice 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:04.649
 active four-wheel drive which we 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:06.809
 set by numbers solving one of the problems 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.559
 all-wheel drive cars 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.519
 the system that existed until now gives 

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.279
 good grade but lose 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.009
 longitudinal and lateral dynamics 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.379
 and have a strong effect 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.789
 understeer 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.479
 we taught our high-torque full 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.360
 drive is actively accelerated on direct 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.289
 and in turns 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.249
 to the behavior of the machine answered 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:25.789
 porsche brand traditions 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.969
 besides, panamera itself has worse 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.619
 sufficient prerequisites to 

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.819
 become a great winter car 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.039
 For example, a large wheelbase creates 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.379
 good stable 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.669
 any panamera is equipped with a proprietary system 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.430
 more market stability 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.509
 which unites the whole press complex 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.939
 release danger 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.110
 among them is kobayashi and anti slip 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.299
 traction and differential control system 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:50.979
 brake assist and several others 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.889
 electronic helpers 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.030
 and even the off psn is always 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.430
 ready to respond to the call please 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.550
 save the world 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.629
 the alarm may become triggered 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.620
 anti-lock brakes though 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.620
 would be on one of the front wheels 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:12.389
 wonder how 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.550
 electronics can tame the temper 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.410
 sports car 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.710
 how much does the difference between the rear 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.009
 and all-wheel drive 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.659
 backed by the electronic mind 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.160
 four-seater porsche ag is easy to manage 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.180
 even on the most slippery surface 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.009
 and in the capable hands of panamera becomes the present 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.920
