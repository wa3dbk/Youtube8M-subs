uses to the derm exclusive me to put
that<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.880> underneath<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.170> could

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that in underneath here it could

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.639 
that in underneath here it could
actually<00:01:49.649> travel<00:01:50.490> downward<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.420> downward<00:01:51.649> is

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually travel downward and downward is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually travel downward and downward is
not<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> end<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
not good because then you end up the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
not good because then you end up the
funks<00:01:54.270> under<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:55.020> rather<00:01:55.740> than<00:01:56.070> getting<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
funks under here rather than getting the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
funks under here rather than getting the
filler<00:01:56.700> where<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.360> doctor<00:01:57.719> wanted<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.229> that's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
filler where the doctor wanted it that's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.249 
filler where the doctor wanted it that's
where<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.490> advantage<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.119> ruslan<00:02:00.600> comes<00:02:00.899> into

I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.610> something<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.869> doctor

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
I think is something that a doctor

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.590 
I think is something that a doctor
because<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.190> incentive<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.450> not

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
because of the incentive but it's not

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.240 
because of the incentive but it's not
really<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.960> best<00:02:14.110> choice<00:02:14.410> for<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
really the best choice for you and it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.280 
really the best choice for you and it
comes<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> under<00:02:15.970> eye<00:02:16.120> hollows<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.140> if

comes to the under eye hollows and if

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.740 
comes to the under eye hollows and if
you<00:02:17.410> saw<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.770> last<00:02:17.950> video<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.430> Ruslan<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.480> saw

you saw my last video on Ruslan you saw

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.230 
you saw my last video on Ruslan you saw

how to manipulate it once it's in there

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.830 
how to manipulate it once it's in there
I<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.860> here's<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.340> team<00:02:39.790> caveat<00:02:40.540> Worth

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
I see here's the team caveat Worth

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.890 
I see here's the team caveat Worth
junior<00:02:41.430> Juvederm<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.000> injected<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
junior Juvederm can be injected and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.750 
junior Juvederm can be injected and
maybe<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:44.290> easier<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:45.010> those<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.490> are<00:02:45.640> not

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
maybe it's easier for those that are not

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.010 
maybe it's easier for those that are not
experienced<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.180> dealing<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
experienced and dealing with it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.320 
experienced and dealing with it
so<00:02:50.470> they'll<00:02:50.680> inject<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.940> kind<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.210> just

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
so they'll inject it and it kind of just

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.430 
so they'll inject it and it kind of just
goes<00:02:52.600> everywhere

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
goes everywhere

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.070 
goes everywhere
whereas<00:02:54.220> wrastlin<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.600> need<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> more

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
whereas wrastlin you need a more

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.710 
whereas wrastlin you need a more
experienced<00:02:56.710> doctor<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.640> be<00:02:57.940> injecting<00:02:58.600> it

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
experienced doctor to be injecting it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.570 
experienced doctor to be injecting it
because<00:02:59.050> they<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.650> know<00:02:59.920> where<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.220> put

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
because they have to know where to put

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.610 
because they have to know where to put
it<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.060> they<00:03:01.390> even<00:03:01.600> have<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.260> manipulate

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
it and then they even have to manipulate

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.150 
it and then they even have to manipulate
or<00:03:03.040> massage<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.270> that<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.900> will<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.770> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
or massage it so that it will be in the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.730 
or massage it so that it will be in the
proper<00:03:06.400> place<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.320> your<00:03:08.530> difference

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
proper place so there is your difference

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.030 
proper place so there is your difference
between<00:03:09.120> Juvederm<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.450> thrust<00:03:11.380> aligned<00:03:11.620> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
between Juvederm and thrust aligned so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.650 
between Juvederm and thrust aligned so
hopefully<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.640> helps<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.030> when<00:03:13.360> you're

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
hopefully that helps you when you're

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.930 
hopefully that helps you when you're
sitting<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:14.050> doctor's<00:03:14.230> office<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.950> they're
