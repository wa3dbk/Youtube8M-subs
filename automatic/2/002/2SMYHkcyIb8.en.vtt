00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right good evening folks something a

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.940 
all right good evening folks something a
little<00:00:02.669> bit<00:00:02.929> different<00:00:03.929> from<00:00:04.080> jet<00:00:04.560> engines

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
little bit different from jet engines

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.130 
little bit different from jet engines
tonight<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.660> I'm<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.839> show<00:00:07.080> you

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
tonight and I'm going to show you

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.560 
tonight and I'm going to show you
something<00:00:07.589> I've<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.730> been<00:00:08.730> working<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
something I've just been working on and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.240 
something I've just been working on and
this<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.880> high<00:00:11.880> voltage<00:00:12.620> power<00:00:13.620> supply<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
this is a high voltage power supply and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
this is a high voltage power supply and
I'm<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> use<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.779> one<00:00:18.990> three

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
I'm going to use this for make one three

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.050 
I'm going to use this for make one three
linear<00:00:19.650> RF<00:00:20.340> amplifier<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:22.580> one<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> this

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
linear RF amplifier and one of the this

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
linear RF amplifier and one of the this
is<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> type<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.800> valve<00:00:26.010> amplifier<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:27.080> my

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
is a type of valve amplifier which my

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.880 
is a type of valve amplifier which my
most<00:00:28.380> high<00:00:29.099> power<00:00:29.400> transmitting<00:00:30.000> valves<00:00:30.890> uses

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
most high power transmitting valves uses

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
most high power transmitting valves uses
a<00:00:31.920> lot<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> high<00:00:32.340> voltage<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> anode<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
a lot of high voltage on the anode so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.600 
a lot of high voltage on the anode so
I've<00:00:34.800> been<00:00:34.920> working<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> nice<00:00:36.300> little

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
I've been working on this nice little

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.310 
I've been working on this nice little
project<00:00:38.610> over<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> last<00:00:39.239> couple<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> weeks

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
project over the last couple of weeks

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.639

and<00:00:41.840> I'm<00:00:42.840> gonna<00:00:43.140> give<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> demonstration

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and I'm gonna give you a demonstration

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.060 
and I'm gonna give you a demonstration
and<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.879> little<00:00:45.120> tour<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.039> about

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and a little tour of what it's all about

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.410 
and a little tour of what it's all about
so<00:00:47.670> let's<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.450> start<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:53.420> right

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so let's just start at the top right

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.229 
so let's just start at the top right
that's<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> top<00:00:58.379> electrical

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
that's the that's the top electrical

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.050 
that's the that's the top electrical
compartment<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:03.080> basically<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
compartment here and basically we have a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.929 
compartment here and basically we have a
lot<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> capacitors<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:08.299> moving<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.510> here

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
lot of capacitors and moving down here

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
lot of capacitors and moving down here
this<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> main<00:01:12.510> rectifying<00:01:13.200> board<00:01:13.530> lots

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this is the main rectifying board lots

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is the main rectifying board lots
of<00:01:14.100> silicon<00:01:14.729> diodes<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.840> equalizing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
of silicon diodes with equalizing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460

resistors<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> capacitors<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> I've

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
resistors and capacitors and I've

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
resistors and capacitors and I've
actually<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.920> three<00:01:20.369> sets<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.330> voltages<00:01:21.780> here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
actually got three sets of voltages here

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.670 
actually got three sets of voltages here
what<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.479> HT<00:01:24.479> voltage<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.350> which

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
what the HT voltage which is going which

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.850 
what the HT voltage which is going which
is<00:01:25.830> about<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.220> thousand<00:01:26.640> volts<00:01:27.619> coming<00:01:28.619> off

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
is about two thousand volts coming off

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.300 
is about two thousand volts coming off
the<00:01:28.950> transformer<00:01:29.640> which<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.299> rectified<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the transformer which is rectified and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.870 
the transformer which is rectified and
with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> capacitors<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.820> some<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
with the capacitors we get about some of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.160 
with the capacitors we get about some of
the<00:01:35.970> region's<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.360> 2.7<00:01:36.900> kV<00:01:38.810> put<00:01:39.810> another

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the region's about 2.7 kV put another

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.249 
the region's about 2.7 kV put another
set<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> bridge<00:01:41.670> rectifiers<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> diodes<00:01:42.960> down

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
set of bridge rectifiers and diodes down

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
set of bridge rectifiers and diodes down
there<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.970> that's<00:01:46.040> screen<00:01:47.040> voltage<00:01:47.869> screen

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
there and that's screen voltage screen

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
there and that's screen voltage screen
HT<00:01:49.380> which<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> about<00:01:50.299> 700<00:01:51.299> volts<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.799> blue

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
HT which is about 700 volts and the blue

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.929 
HT which is about 700 volts and the blue
capacitor<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:56.630> capacitor<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
capacitor there is my capacitor for the

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
capacitor there is my capacitor for the
negative<00:01:59.939> bias<00:02:00.240> which<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.680> hundred

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
negative bias which is all about hundred

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.740 
negative bias which is all about hundred
volts<00:02:02.640> minus<00:02:03.119> 100<00:02:03.479> volts<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> I've<00:02:06.299> got<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
volts minus 100 volts and so I've got a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
volts minus 100 volts and so I've got a
number<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> different<00:02:07.350> voltages<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
number of different voltages here and it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.830 
number of different voltages here and it
gives<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.849> versatility<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
gives a bit more versatility to this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.230 
gives a bit more versatility to this
power<00:02:10.080> supply<00:02:11.120> moving<00:02:12.120> over<00:02:12.330> there

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
power supply moving over there

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.100 
power supply moving over there
we<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.600> resistor<00:02:14.080> board<00:02:14.320> which<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
we have the resistor board which is the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.690 
we have the resistor board which is the
multiplying<00:02:17.110> resistors<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
multiplying resistors for the for the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.150 
multiplying resistors for the for the
meter<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> front<00:02:19.450> panel<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:21.010> that's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
meter on the front panel because that's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.460 
meter on the front panel because that's
the<00:02:21.310> standard<00:02:21.580> 500<00:02:22.210> micron<00:02:22.690> meter<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.350> we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the standard 500 micron meter and we

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.270 
the standard 500 micron meter and we
want<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.710> read<00:02:23.860> about<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:25.060> up<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.170> 5<00:02:26.350> kv<00:02:26.680> but

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
want to read about out up to 5 kv but

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.520 
want to read about out up to 5 kv but
this<00:02:27.700> pass<00:02:27.910> by<00:02:28.180> where<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.450> give<00:02:28.690> only<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.260> limit

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
this pass by where we give only to limit

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.920 
this pass by where we give only to limit
somewhere<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:31.540> about<00:02:31.840> 2.8<00:02:32.620> kV<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
somewhere of about 2.8 kV and there's a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.360 
somewhere of about 2.8 kV and there's a
couple<00:02:35.080> other<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.320> boards<00:02:35.890> there<00:02:36.100> for

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
couple other little boards there for

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.880 
couple other little boards there for
controlling<00:02:37.270> relays<00:02:37.750> voltage<00:02:38.200> regulators

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
controlling relays voltage regulators

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.940 
controlling relays voltage regulators
etc<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.930> what<00:02:41.110> I'll<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.740> come<00:02:42.550> down<00:02:42.580> here

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
etc so what I'll do is come down here

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430 
etc so what I'll do is come down here
and<00:02:44.950> we'll<00:02:45.190> see<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> bit<00:02:46.840> dark<00:02:47.140> but

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
and we'll see the it's a bit dark but

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.950 
and we'll see the it's a bit dark but
you<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:47.530> see<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.830> business<00:02:48.010> end<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
you can see the business end of the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.770 
you can see the business end of the
power<00:02:49.960> supply<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.780> massive

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
power supply that is the massive

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.500 
power supply that is the massive
transformer<00:02:54.390> which<00:02:55.410> provides<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.510> high

how<00:03:22.630> much<00:03:23.260> voltage<00:03:23.410> we're<00:03:23.770> getting<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.780> let's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
how much voltage we're getting so let's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.340 
how much voltage we're getting so let's
have<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.530> look<00:03:26.680> at<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:26.980> front<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.140> front

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
have a look at the front so the front

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.660 
have a look at the front so the front
panel<00:03:32.770> goes<00:03:33.160> straight<00:03:33.430> forward

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
panel goes straight forward

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.110 
panel goes straight forward
we've<00:03:36.670> got<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.880> little<00:03:37.090> panel<00:03:37.870> meter<00:03:38.050> there<00:03:38.380> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
we've got a little panel meter there and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.310 
we've got a little panel meter there and
we're<00:03:40.120> interested<00:03:40.330> in<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:42.900> scales<00:03:43.900> reading

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
we're interested in the scales reading

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.120 
we're interested in the scales reading
naught<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.890> 500<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:45.790> that's<00:03:45.910> multiplied<00:03:46.510> by

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.470 

arduino<00:04:09.040> LED<00:04:10.040> shield<00:04:10.430> which<00:04:10.730> i<00:04:11.000> just<00:04:11.239> put<00:04:11.450> in

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
arduino LED shield which i just put in

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.190 
arduino LED shield which i just put in
there<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.709> bit<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.280> fun<00:04:14.019> program<00:04:15.019> that

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
there just to a bit of fun program that

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.170 
there just to a bit of fun program that
just<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.500> say<00:04:15.680> high<00:04:15.830> voltage<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.639> then<00:04:17.090> we

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
just to say high voltage and then we

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.699 
just to say high voltage and then we
have<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:18.590> lane<00:04:18.739> switches<00:04:19.280> circuit<00:04:19.549> breakers

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
have the lane switches circuit breakers

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.740 
have the lane switches circuit breakers
so<00:04:21.709> let's<00:04:21.889> see<00:04:22.190> what<00:04:22.340> happens<00:04:22.669> now<00:04:22.940> that's

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
so let's see what happens now that's

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.159 
so let's see what happens now that's
right

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
right

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.600 
right
once<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:24.860> switch<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.280> on<00:04:27.190> if<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.370> look<00:04:28.490> at

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
once we switch this on if you look at

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.830 
once we switch this on if you look at
the<00:04:28.669> meet<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:29.030> we'll<00:04:29.180> try<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.419> zoom<00:04:29.570> me<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
the meet so we'll try and zoom me on the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230 
the meet so we'll try and zoom me on the
meter<00:04:30.460> you'll<00:04:31.460> be<00:04:31.580> able<00:04:31.639> to<00:04:31.760> see<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.970> effect

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
meter you'll be able to see the effect

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.480 
meter you'll be able to see the effect
of<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.449> soft<00:04:32.690> stop<00:04:33.020> might<00:04:33.380> tell<00:04:33.590> on<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.770> HD<00:04:34.190> so

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
of the soft stop might tell on the HD so

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.360 
of the soft stop might tell on the HD so
we'll<00:04:34.940> just<00:04:35.120> flick<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.780> switch<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:37.160> main

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
we'll just flick the switch the main

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.920 
we'll just flick the switch the main
switch<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:40.490> there's<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.880> little<00:04:42.760> arduino<00:04:43.930> LED

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
switch and there's a little arduino LED

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.250 
switch and there's a little arduino LED
shield<00:04:45.290> going<00:04:45.680> nicely<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.750> let's<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:48.110> come

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
shield going nicely so let's just come

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.400 
shield going nicely so let's just come
back<00:04:48.290> home<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.650> know<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.550> well<00:04:50.240> nice

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.690 
rosemary HT you should be able to see
the<00:04:54.500> voltage<00:04:55.210> go<00:04:56.210> up<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.389> about<00:04:56.510> 1.4<00:04:57.350> kv<00:04:57.800> with

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
the voltage go up to about 1.4 kv with

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.820 
the voltage go up to about 1.4 kv with
as<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.180> slow<00:04:59.389> start<00:04:59.810> kicks<00:05:00.110> in<00:05:00.350> and<00:05:00.590> then

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
as the slow start kicks in and then

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.210 
as the slow start kicks in and then
reach<00:05:01.340> its<00:05:01.610> maximum<00:05:01.910> voltage<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.830> let's<00:05:04.039> go

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
reach its maximum voltage so let's go

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.950 
reach its maximum voltage so let's go
for<00:05:04.430> there

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:18.560 

they<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:10.889> it's<00:05:11.370> about<00:05:13.699> 2.7<00:05:14.699> kV<00:05:17.389> which<00:05:18.389> is

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
they have it's about 2.7 kV which is

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.629 
they have it's about 2.7 kV which is
pretty<00:05:18.810> good<00:05:22.669> nice<00:05:24.620> AC<00:05:25.620> hum<00:05:26.160> which<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.460> can

get<00:05:41.120> looking<00:05:42.120> more<00:05:42.330> than<00:05:42.509> a<00:05:42.539> nasty<00:05:43.020> shock

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
get looking more than a nasty shock

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.960 
get looking more than a nasty shock
so<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:45.630> steer<00:05:45.930> well<00:05:46.139> clear<00:05:46.169> of<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:49.970> coming

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
so you steer well clear of it and coming

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.400 
so you steer well clear of it and coming
back<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.330> meter<00:05:51.539> when<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.870> switch<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.259> off

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
back to the meter when I switch it off

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.010 
back to the meter when I switch it off
you'll<00:05:52.710> be<00:05:52.860> able<00:05:52.949> to<00:05:53.069> see<00:05:55.250> zoom<00:05:56.250> in<00:05:56.460> there<00:05:57.020> you

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
you'll be able to see zoom in there you

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.529 
you'll be able to see zoom in there you
should<00:05:58.050> be<00:05:58.229> able<00:05:58.319> to<00:05:58.530> see<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.090> voltage<00:06:00.090> drop

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
should be able to see the voltage drop

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.879 
should be able to see the voltage drop
as<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.840> bleeding<00:06:01.289> resistors<00:06:01.680> on<00:06:01.800> the

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
as the bleeding resistors on the

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:10.460 
as the bleeding resistors on the
capacitors<00:06:02.460> take<00:06:02.639> over<00:06:09.080> there<00:06:10.080> we<00:06:10.199> go<00:06:10.319> the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
capacitors take over there we go the

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.200 
capacitors take over there we go the
voltage<00:06:10.830> slowly<00:06:12.139> dropping<00:06:13.139> off<00:06:13.380> of<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:14.210> again

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
voltage slowly dropping off of it again

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.520 
voltage slowly dropping off of it again
you<00:06:15.360> don't<00:06:15.539> beat<00:06:15.690> one<00:06:15.780> I'm<00:06:15.930> probably<00:06:16.229> putting

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
you don't beat one I'm probably putting

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.100 
you don't beat one I'm probably putting
your<00:06:16.800> fingers<00:06:17.190> in<00:06:17.370> there<00:06:17.580> even<00:06:18.509> when<00:06:18.780> it's<00:06:18.900> off

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
your fingers in there even when it's off

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.990 
your fingers in there even when it's off
cause<00:06:19.349> the<00:06:19.470> capacitors<00:06:20.370> do<00:06:20.550> take<00:06:20.759> a<00:06:20.789> few

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
cause the capacitors do take a few

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.430 
cause the capacitors do take a few
minutes<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.389> discharge<00:06:24.020> so<00:06:27.050> that's<00:06:28.050> my<00:06:28.229> lid

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
minutes to discharge so that's my lid

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.969 
minutes to discharge so that's my lid
all<00:06:28.560> their<00:06:31.009> power<00:06:32.009> supply<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:33.889> thanks<00:06:34.889> for

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
all their power supply and thanks for

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.039 
all their power supply and thanks for
watching
