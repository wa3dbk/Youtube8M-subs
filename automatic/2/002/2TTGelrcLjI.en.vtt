00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
him at a clinic geez a couple years ago

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760 
him at a clinic geez a couple years ago
um<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.570> he<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.929> he<00:00:16.049> believes<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.590> lot

um you know he that he believes in a lot

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.420 
um you know he that he believes in a lot
of<00:00:16.800> one-on-one

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
of one-on-one

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.450 
of one-on-one
two-on-two<00:00:17.880> drills<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:19.529> he<00:00:20.010> does<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.400> with

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
two-on-two drills and he does this with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
two-on-two drills and he does this with
his<00:00:20.789> uh<00:00:20.820> with<00:00:21.689> his<00:00:21.810> Marquette<00:00:22.289> Golden<00:00:23.100> Eagles

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I guess they are now rather than

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.560 
I guess they are now rather than
warriors<00:00:25.550> all<00:00:26.550> that's<00:00:26.820> calling<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> Warriors

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
warriors all that's calling the Warriors

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
but what this drill does is again it's a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.669 
but what this drill does is again it's a
one-on-one<00:00:30.330> defensive<00:00:31.199> drill<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one-on-one defensive drill it's got a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740 
one-on-one defensive drill it's got a
couple<00:00:31.920> tweaks<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.910> call<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> one

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
couple tweaks so we call this one on one

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
couple tweaks so we call this one on one
half<00:00:34.489> these<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.670> basically<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> like

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
half these are basically kind of like

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
half these are basically kind of like
cousins<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.320> each<00:00:37.440> other<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.800> far<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.100> drills

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
cousins of each other as far as drills
