a few pointers on things to look out for
when<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.360> performing<00:00:15.509> the

when you're actually performing the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.680 
when you're actually performing the
track<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.379> shall<00:00:16.890> employ<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.190> second<00:00:17.699> time<00:00:17.880> with

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
track I shall employ a second time with

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.000 
track I shall employ a second time with
the<00:00:18.720> tempo<00:00:19.050> backed<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.619> bit<00:00:19.890> about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the tempo backed off a little bit about

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.870 
the tempo backed off a little bit about
20%

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
20%

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.700 
20%
I<00:00:20.910> shall<00:00:21.570> then<00:00:21.779> finally<00:00:22.260> apply<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I shall then finally apply it for a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050 
I shall then finally apply it for a
third<00:00:22.890> time<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.160> I'll<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.609> turn<00:00:23.880> my

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
third time but I'll actually turn my

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
third time but I'll actually turn my
volume<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.660> down<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.830> can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
volume all the way down so you can

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.589 
volume all the way down so you can
actually<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.699> where<00:00:26.849> my<00:00:26.939> hands<00:00:27.119> ask<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.449> to

where I am in the pace but you can use

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.220 
where I am in the pace but you can use
that<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> vendors<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> slowdown

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that the vendors about the slowdown

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
that the vendors about the slowdown
backing<00:00:31.800> track<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> practice<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> an

backing track to practice them to it an
easy<00:00:33.420> temper<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.739> I'll<00:00:35.160> play<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> track

easy temper what I'll play the track

00:00:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
easy temper what I'll play the track
post<00:00:38.899> one<00:00:40.070> two

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.400 

right<00:01:37.960> okay<00:01:40.050> when<00:01:41.050> you're<00:01:41.140> learning<00:01:41.230> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
right okay when you're learning the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.360 
right okay when you're learning the
first<00:01:41.560> riff<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.100> bit<00:01:46.980> break<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.100> down<00:01:48.190> into

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
first riff that bit break it down into

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.770 
first riff that bit break it down into
sections<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.880> make<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.120> easier<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.390> memorize

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
sections to make it easier to memorize

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.960 
sections to make it easier to memorize
it<00:01:50.200> first<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:50.530> all<00:01:50.650> so<00:01:50.890> look<00:01:51.490> at<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.640> first<00:01:51.670> two

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
it first of all so look at the first two

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.310 
it first of all so look at the first two
dates<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.600> first<00:01:52.930> four<00:01:53.080> notes<00:01:55.320> just

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
dates and first four notes just

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.690 
dates and first four notes just
repeating<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.800> same<00:01:57.010> two<00:01:57.160> notes<00:01:58.890> okay<00:01:59.920> then

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
repeating the same two notes okay then

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.380 
repeating the same two notes okay then
try<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.300> second<00:02:01.630> two<00:02:01.720> beats<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.080> bar

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
try the second two beats of the bar

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.490 
try the second two beats of the bar
you<00:02:04.390> suddenly<00:02:04.540> realize<00:02:04.690> that's<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.170> same<00:02:05.380> two

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
you suddenly realize that's the same two

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.109 
you suddenly realize that's the same two
notes<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.890> well<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:08.820> once<00:02:09.820> you've<00:02:09.940> got<00:02:10.030> that

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
notes as well so once you've got that

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.760 
notes as well so once you've got that
movement<00:02:10.480> sorted<00:02:10.750> out<00:02:10.899> try<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.140> next<00:02:11.320> bit

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.300 

then<00:02:14.770> put<00:02:14.920> them<00:02:15.010> together<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.130> makes

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
then put them together so on so it makes

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.710 
then put them together so on so it makes
it<00:02:18.370> much<00:02:18.550> easier<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.970> actually<00:02:19.090> memorize<00:02:19.540> if

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
it much easier to actually memorize if

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.230 
it much easier to actually memorize if
you<00:02:19.810> break<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.140> down<00:02:20.230> into<00:02:20.440> small<00:02:20.680> pieces

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
you break it down into small pieces

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.980 
you break it down into small pieces
right<00:02:22.240> measure<00:02:22.480> three<00:02:22.920> you've<00:02:23.920> got<00:02:27.990> be

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
right measure three you've got be

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.990 
right measure three you've got be
careful<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.500> rest<00:02:29.740> okay<00:02:30.070> if<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.280> listen<00:02:30.940> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
careful that rest okay if you listen to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.820 
careful that rest okay if you listen to
me<00:02:31.090> tapping<00:02:31.300> my<00:02:31.480> foot<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:34.740> you've<00:02:35.740> got

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
me tapping my foot it's not you've got

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.290 
me tapping my foot it's not you've got
to<00:02:35.920> make<00:02:36.040> sure<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.310> third<00:02:36.640> no<00:02:36.850> who's<00:02:37.090> moved

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
to make sure that third no who's moved

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.300 
to make sure that third no who's moved
back<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> little<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.870> played<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.290> offbeat

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.130 

okay<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.400> don't<00:02:42.610> miss<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.820> one<00:02:43.060> out<00:02:43.209> same

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
okay so don't miss that one out same

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.030 
okay so don't miss that one out same
with<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.320> course<00:02:44.530> when<00:02:44.739> you're<00:02:44.830> going<00:02:44.920> from

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
with the course when you're going from

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.190 
with the course when you're going from
the<00:02:45.100> D<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> F<00:02:45.610> chord<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.900> may<00:02:47.050> not

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the D to the F chord and you may not

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.630 
the D to the F chord and you may not
look<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.770> is<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> simple<00:02:48.340> D<00:02:49.239> chord

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
look like it but it is a simple D chord

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.380 
look like it but it is a simple D chord
there<00:02:51.640> cool

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
there cool

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.270 
there cool
so<00:02:52.750> if<00:02:52.989> you're<00:02:53.140> used<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.620> playing<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.950> longer<00:02:54.160> D

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
so if you're used to playing a longer D

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.250 
so if you're used to playing a longer D
chord<00:02:54.570> rather<00:02:55.570> than<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.840> playing<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.110> two

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
chord rather than just playing the two

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.930 
chord rather than just playing the two
notes<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.709> have<00:02:56.830> written<00:02:57.459> nicely<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
notes that have written nicely on the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.020

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
it's just a decoy right as we can look

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.290 
it's just a decoy right as we can look
out<00:03:13.450> for<00:03:14.670> all<00:03:15.670> right<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:15.970> got<00:03:16.060> our<00:03:16.180> first

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
mute strikes in here towards the end one

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.810 
mute strikes in here towards the end one
two<00:03:19.239> three<00:03:19.660> four<00:03:20.470> yeah<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.950> fourth<00:03:21.550> measure

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
two three four yeah the fourth measure

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.180 
two three four yeah the fourth measure
on<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.120> fourth<00:03:22.330> line<00:03:22.739> you've<00:03:23.739> got<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.070> them

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
on the fourth line you've got to them

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.650 
on the fourth line you've got to them
some<00:03:24.340> mysterious<00:03:24.580> crosses<00:03:25.120> appearing<00:03:25.239> on

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
some mysterious crosses appearing on

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.540 
some mysterious crosses appearing on
that<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.440> stage<00:03:26.709> now<00:03:26.920> what<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.100> means<00:03:27.220> is

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
that on the stage now what that means is

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.290 
that on the stage now what that means is
a<00:03:27.670> mute<00:03:27.940> stroke<00:03:28.360> okay<00:03:28.769> what<00:03:29.769> needs<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.300> is

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
a mute stroke okay what needs to do is

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.840 
a mute stroke okay what needs to do is
place<00:03:31.810> your<00:03:31.840> head<00:03:32.140> over<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> strings<00:03:33.010> and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
place your head over the strings and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.199 
place your head over the strings and
then<00:03:34.769> pluck<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.860> strings

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
then pluck the strings

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.309 
then pluck the strings
so<00:03:38.209> they<00:03:38.299> actually<00:03:38.480> produce<00:03:38.719> any<00:03:39.079> now<00:03:39.200> it

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
so they actually produce any now it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.690 
so they actually produce any now it
takes<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.799> bit<00:03:39.920> getting<00:03:40.129> used<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.400> because<00:03:40.549> what

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
takes a bit getting used to because what

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.920 
takes a bit getting used to because what
you'll<00:03:40.849> find<00:03:40.969> initially<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.599> when<00:03:41.719> you<00:03:41.780> put

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
you'll find initially is when you put

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.000 
you'll find initially is when you put
your<00:03:42.019> hand<00:03:42.170> over<00:03:42.260> you'll<00:03:42.499> press<00:03:42.739> down<00:03:42.980> very

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
your hand over you'll press down very

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.899 
your hand over you'll press down very
slightly<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.689> get<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> lot<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.079> random

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
slightly and you get a lot of random

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.280 
slightly and you get a lot of random
notes<00:03:46.909> coming<00:03:47.299> out<00:03:47.389> okay<00:03:47.599> so<00:03:47.659> make<00:03:48.019> sure<00:03:48.049> you

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
notes coming out okay so make sure you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.750 
notes coming out okay so make sure you
don't<00:03:48.439> press<00:03:48.680> your<00:03:48.829> hand<00:03:48.980> down<00:03:49.159> you're<00:03:49.400> just

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
don't press your hand down you're just

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.009 
don't press your hand down you're just
laying<00:03:49.969> your<00:03:50.120> finger<00:03:50.389> across<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.749> strings

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
laying your finger across the strings

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.110 
laying your finger across the strings
we're<00:03:51.200> not<00:03:51.469> pressing<00:03:51.709> them<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.939> you<00:03:53.030> get

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
we're not pressing them down so you get

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.199 
we're not pressing them down so you get
that<00:03:53.239> nice<00:03:53.420> muted<00:03:54.349> set<00:03:54.709> so<00:03:55.700> what<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:55.909> then<00:03:56.030> do

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
that nice muted set so what you then do

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.959 
that nice muted set so what you then do
is<00:03:56.950> then<00:03:57.950> get<00:03:58.159> ready<00:03:58.310> with<00:03:58.459> your<00:03:58.549> first<00:03:58.730> finger

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969

is then get ready with your first finger
and<00:03:59.239> play<00:03:59.510> the<00:04:00.319> two<00:04:00.579> first<00:04:01.579> frets<00:04:02.019> F<00:04:03.019> in<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.319> C

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
and play the two first frets F in the C

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.110 
and play the two first frets F in the C
note<00:04:03.849> on<00:04:04.849> top<00:04:04.909> two<00:04:05.269> strings<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.840> new<00:04:06.049> strikes

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
note on top two strings so new strikes

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.229 
note on top two strings so new strikes
then<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.239> actually<00:04:08.569> knows<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.790> again<00:04:14.030> that's

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239

press<00:04:14.689> let's<00:04:15.019> just<00:04:15.139> do<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.319> loop<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.769> it<00:04:15.949> so<00:04:16.820> once

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
press let's just do a loop of it so once

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.640 
press let's just do a loop of it so once
you<00:04:17.060> can<00:04:17.180> get<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:17.449> music<00:04:18.049> sound<00:04:18.440> nice<00:04:18.620> and

you can get that music sound nice and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.240 
you can get that music sound nice and
clean<00:04:23.259> practice<00:04:24.259> doing<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> loop<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.160> can

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
clean practice doing is a loop you can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.070 
clean practice doing is a loop you can
do<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.430> nice<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.610> consistently<00:04:30.340> look<00:04:31.340> out<00:04:31.490> for

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
do it nice and consistently look out for

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.629 
do it nice and consistently look out for
there's<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.259> the<00:04:33.830> F<00:04:33.919> chord<00:04:34.070> at<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.280> end<00:04:34.430> you're

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
there's a the F chord at the end you're

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.980 
there's a the F chord at the end you're
introducing<00:04:35.030> rubber<00:04:35.330> top<00:04:35.660> two<00:04:35.930> strings

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
introducing rubber top two strings

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.689 
introducing rubber top two strings
you've<00:04:36.500> got<00:04:36.680> the<00:04:36.740> second<00:04:37.099> fret<00:04:37.280> as<00:04:37.370> well<00:04:37.520> which

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
you've got the second fret as well which

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.310 
you've got the second fret as well which
you'll<00:04:37.849> find<00:04:37.880> quite<00:04:38.750> difficult<00:04:38.960> to<00:04:39.110> play

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
you'll find quite difficult to play

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.890 
you'll find quite difficult to play
initially<00:04:40.210> we're<00:04:41.210> gonna<00:04:41.389> kind<00:04:41.599> of<00:04:41.630> get<00:04:41.720> used

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
initially we're gonna kind of get used

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.360 
initially we're gonna kind of get used
to<00:04:41.960> doing<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:42.199> folding<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.830> first<00:04:43.130> finger

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
to doing this folding that first finger

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.089 
to doing this folding that first finger
really<00:04:44.300> down<00:04:44.479> flat<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.740> can<00:04:45.889> get<00:04:46.009> the

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
really down flat so you can get the

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.790 
really down flat so you can get the
space<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:47.030> get<00:04:47.180> your<00:04:48.110> second<00:04:48.440> finger<00:04:48.530> over

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
space to get your second finger over

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.040 
space to get your second finger over
without<00:04:49.159> hitting<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.490> top<00:04:49.699> two<00:04:49.880> strings<00:04:50.050> so

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
without hitting the top two strings so

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.719 
without hitting the top two strings so
again<00:04:51.229> practice<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.919> by<00:04:52.099> just<00:04:52.340> playing<00:04:52.550> the

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
again practice it by just playing the

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.360 
again practice it by just playing the
strings<00:04:53.000> individually

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
strings individually
