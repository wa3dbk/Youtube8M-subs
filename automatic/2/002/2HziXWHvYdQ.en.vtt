00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 today I come to teach how to make 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.430
 paper plane easier in the world that is 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.720
 nothing can go wrong 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.490
 what we need is a sheet of paper 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.060
 white color 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.880
 on cardboard what you want what 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 second is going to be to fold the sheet 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.539
 in half 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 then open it 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.520
 and bend these two points 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.520
 this party towards the center 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.000
 same with the other 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.720
 and the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 as we already doubled these two parts back 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.259
 to the center 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.190
 and will begin to bend the wing 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.950
 A) Yes 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.860
 but there are different goods that also 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 with different shapes you can also 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 do double the wing 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 A) Yes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.920
 and then that's it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.230
 you can do a fold 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.420
 and so is a paper script of the most 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.420
 easy
