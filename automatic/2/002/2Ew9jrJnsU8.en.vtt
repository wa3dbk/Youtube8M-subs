let the book influenced the game to this
extent<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.680> things<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.369> we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
extent and things like this and so we

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.969 
extent and things like this and so we
were<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:39.000> were<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.240> timid<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:40.860> we

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
were we were very timid and I think we

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
were we were very timid and I think we
grew<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.400> more<00:01:41.700> comfortable<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.420> work

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
grew much more comfortable as we work

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.569 
grew much more comfortable as we work
through<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:44.159> book<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
through that that first book and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219 
through that that first book and
particularly<00:01:44.880> after<00:01:45.030> sending<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> first

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
particularly after sending the first

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.569 
particularly after sending the first
book<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.860> working<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> script

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
book in and then working on the script

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
book in and then working on the script
for<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.880> second<00:01:48.210> game<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.479> where<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.049> got

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
for the second game that's where it got

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
for the second game that's where it got
very<00:01:49.290> collaborative<00:01:49.890> where<00:01:50.490> we're<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.759> what

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
very collaborative where we're like what

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.550 
very collaborative where we're like what
if<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.180> did<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> guys<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.380> this

if we did this what can you guys do this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.840 
if we did this what can you guys do this
in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.710> game<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> working<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> do

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
in the game is this working if you do

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
in the game is this working if you do
this<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> could<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
this this is what I could do for the

this this is what I could do for the
next<00:01:55.619> book<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> things<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.850> it's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
next book and things like that so it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.200 
next book and things like that so it's
evolved<00:01:57.659> into<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.430> very<00:01:59.430> creative
