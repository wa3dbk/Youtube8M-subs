00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
soundblaster technology so basically

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.610 
soundblaster technology so basically
they've<00:02:54.540> taken<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> creative<00:02:55.290> stuff<00:02:55.320> and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.870 
they've taken all the creative stuff and
put<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.739> actually<00:02:56.070> right<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.519> board

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
put it actually right on the board

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.940 
put it actually right on the board
pretty<00:02:57.209> interesting<00:02:57.540> stuff<00:02:57.769> we'll<00:02:58.769> take<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
pretty interesting stuff we'll take a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.250 
pretty interesting stuff we'll take a
look<00:02:59.130> at<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> rear<00:02:59.400> i/o<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> board<00:03:00.260> you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
look at the rear i/o of the board you

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.830 
look at the rear i/o of the board you
can<00:03:01.320> see<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:01.830> four<00:03:02.370> USB<00:03:02.790> 3.0<00:03:03.450> connectors

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
can see it's got four USB 3.0 connectors

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.979 
can see it's got four USB 3.0 connectors
there<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.200> couple<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> USB<00:03:05.190> 2.0<00:03:05.910> s<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.209> single<00:03:06.810> LAN

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
there a couple of USB 2.0 s a single LAN

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.110 
there a couple of USB 2.0 s a single LAN
which<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> Bigfoot<00:03:07.799> land<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.940> your

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
which is the Bigfoot land got your

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.780 
which is the Bigfoot land got your
standard<00:03:09.530> 7.1<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.560> digital<00:03:11.130> audio<00:03:11.220> featuring

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
standard 7.1 and digital audio featuring

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.930 
standard 7.1 and digital audio featuring
both<00:03:11.940> coaxial<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.690> s<00:03:13.260> patife<00:03:13.709> outputs<00:03:14.310> so

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
both coaxial and s patife outputs so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.720 
both coaxial and s patife outputs so
this<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.360> pretty<00:03:15.480> much<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> board<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.610> mean<00:03:17.610> as

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
this is pretty much the board I mean as

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.920 
this is pretty much the board I mean as
you<00:03:17.790> guys<00:03:17.970> know<00:03:18.150> me<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:18.810> more

over here which is basically going to be

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.660 
over here which is basically going to be
your<00:03:21.480> say<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.170> six<00:03:22.380> gigabit<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:22.860> stuff<00:03:23.130> but

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
your say the six gigabit and stuff but
