00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.709
 hello magmatic today I will try 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.059
 answer a question that maybe a lot 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.790
 people are doing this Christmas and 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.160
 is I bought an ipad and if I bought a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.990
 ipad which I buy well well I 'm going 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
 to say what is for me the answer 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.110
 for me the answer is the ipad mini 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.540
 Well, a lot of people maybe it's 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.420
 asking if it's just an ipad 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.140
 small or is a less powerful ipad or a 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.940
 ipad cheaper but I think apple 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 has achieved something that is very difficult to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.170
 do and is has gotten it is that the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.780
 ipad experience will fit you now in 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.480
 a hand because because if you compare it 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.890
 the dimensions of those of the ipad 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.380
 you see the ipad mini 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 it's made just for me to enter a 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.489
 hand I have the hand so a little 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
 small and therefore costs me a bit without 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.590
 But it also weighs half of 300 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.350
 grams compared to about 600 that will weigh the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 conventional ipad and that makes it possible 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 hold it in a thousand situations during 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.479
 much more time and much more 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 comfortable this you can take it from this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.480
 in this way something that with an ipad 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.200
 normal because the ipad is uncomfortable 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.659
 it's a bit heavy the 10-inch and 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.509
 because 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.390
 the new ipad for people who move 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.549
 much on public transport or that is 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.760
 from one place to another at home and does not want 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.710
 carry such a big thing 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.910
 who is like me who uses a laptop 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.100
 small in that case the normal ipad 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.220
 maybe duplicate the devices that's why 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.650
 for me the ipad mini is perfect and you 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.900
 I'm going to tell you a little bit, what are 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 the features of this ipad look 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.720
 The first thing that draws attention is that 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.430
 it's like a giant ipod touch does not have 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 well the same camera in the part 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.470
 back the front camera and the design 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.350
 of the bevel is also the same is very 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.630
 thin but does not have that curve so 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.870
 sharp that has the conventional ipad 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.330
 this maybe on the conventional ipad 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.590
 what it does is that the sensation is 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.450
 also thinness 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 but the edge so sharp to me 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.680
 personally I do not like it I like it 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.050
 more this softer edge then there is another 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.720
 question and is that apple as you see has 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.550
 reduced the sides of the frame 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.280
 this happens that there are people who think 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
 that what you are going to suppose is that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.800
 take it this way the fingers can 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.630
 interact with 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.410
 however apple through the software 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.420
 what he has achieved is to make the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.150
 ipad does not interact when it perceives that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.420
 that is being supported is this part of the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.420
 hand 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.330
 very good in regards to the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.760
 resolution what what what are you going to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.800
 see is that the ipad mini has the same 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.030
 resolution that the ipad2 and also account 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.850
 with the same characteristics of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.430
 hardware the same a5 processor and so on 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.070
 but what happens that this is the same 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.550
 resolution that ipads have in their 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.110
 mode no retina because this screen a 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.420
 of the disadvantages that you have with 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.610
 regarding the latest generation ipad 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.650
 is that which is not retina does not have that 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.500
 density of points and that sharpness so 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.240
 However, the truth is that 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 well, it's not a very big resignation that 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 you're going to do not when you see 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.770
 applications in which you have to see 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.810
 texts and other very small because if 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.360
 you can tell the difference because the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.810
 reading in the conventional cases of 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.080
 Retina is very comfortable for this without 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.080
 embargo 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.410
 in the ipad mini is also not read badly 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.570
 just maybe in some 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.370
 situation what you have is that expand 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.409
 a little more visualization 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.209
 and as I told you the disposition of everything 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.450
 it's the same buttons instead of being 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.580
 a solid button we're going in one piece are 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.049
 two pieces this sometimes because for me it's 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.299
 a little more uncomfortable because you do not give 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.220
 count well if you're with one another 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.620
 while in the other it was very was very 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.049
 easy it is very easy to touch to know when 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.000
 you are raising or lowering the volume very 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.379
 well another question that people are 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090
 question is whether this size of the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.480
 screen does not make it uncomfortable to manage 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.240
 well, in my experience, the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.550
 truth is that 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.410
 the keyboard is a little smaller the 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.770
 keyboard on screen but it is not done 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.530
 overly uncomfortable to use and the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.980
 unique in the only other uncomfortable point is 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.790
 maybe when you have a browser with 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.790
 many tabs open 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.010
 maybe a little harder to guess 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.810
 because the window is made a little 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.009
 small the elements on screen will 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.020
 they do a little small though 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.400
 in what is normal use no no no 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.490
 you are many differences if you think about it 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.949
 the icons are a little smaller but 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.990
 if you compare them for example with a 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.090
 iphone because they are much larger 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.290
 what else do we have look like 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.810
 of the sound the ipad the forgiveness of ipad 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.280
 mini have two speakers on the sides 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.380
 of the lightning connector 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.000
 as opposed to the ipad 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.370
 conventional ones that have a single 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.170
 speaker however the sound then to 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.820
 Despite being stereo it is not much 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.070
 quality because it can be useful for 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.900
 listen to the sound of a movie or 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.340
 to listen to background music but not what 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.860
 you are going to use to enjoy the 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.879
 music 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.219
 so as you see for me the ipad mini 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.340
 is really the ipad of this Christmas 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.199
 why then because you have all the 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.919
 experience of an ipad 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.900
 almost at the price of what we would say then 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.419
 a reader of books that put round the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.310
 the 100 euros, well, the ipad is 300 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.110
 the truth is that it is much more but if 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.230
 you are thinking everything you can do 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.990
 an ipad of application games 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.570
 of multimedia is to say the power to record 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.700
 with his camera in full hd on high 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.070
 resolution in the camera that you have for 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.990
 make photos of 5 of 5 megapixels what 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.080
 true is that he does so many things that 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.170
 they do not read books that for me 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.730
 it does not have a leaf turn it is very much 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.460
 more interesting an ipad even if it costs 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.940
 two or three times as much as I give you as 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.970
 I was telling you for me this is the ipad of 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.950
 this Christmas and so it seems that what 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.350
 are reaffirming the success it has in 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.210
 sales it seems that even apple is being 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.160
 now realizing that this ipad 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.480
 small you can get to be more successful 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.340
 that the great 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.870
 well so far this first 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.580
 analysis of more fans I hope that you 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.770
 I liked it and I hope you mention it 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.920
 in the forum so thank you and until the 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.920
 next
