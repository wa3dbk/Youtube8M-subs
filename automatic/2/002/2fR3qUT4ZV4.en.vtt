00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 Now there will be a video review of the pump aquarium 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.509
 new jed 6000 system 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.950
 performance from the name already 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.120
 clear at 6000 liters per hour with power 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 70 watts in pictures we see 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.029
 complete set and how it can be 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.449
 modify with the help of nozzles 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.830
 different on in such a stretch on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.480
 graph we see the ratio of height and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.829
 performance issued by the pump at 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 increase in the length of the water column 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:43.290
 that is, we see that he gives 6 hours 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.559
 six thousand liters per hour but at a height of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.329
 2 meters he will give about four with 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.809
 by half 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:57.180
 oh three and a half there 4 3,700 liters 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 an hour of such a bomb will be enough for 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 800 liters aquarium if the height is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.909
 meter and a half 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.409
 or five hundred six hundred 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:19.070
 for if there is a pillar height of about 2 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:27.659
 meters so now let's see without 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 pump it with a box full kilogram 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.950
 700 hung before 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.250
 the pump itself was one and a half kilograms 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.400
 approximately and so complete set 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.400
 nozzles with 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:56.670
 diameter of 22 millimeters and then 25 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.310
 Something also on the back cover 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.480
 in order to secure the pump with a set 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:13.490
 suction cups for fixing sweat 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.490
 complete stage 2 and the actual itself 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:25.880
 pump compartment mouth it is protected by a box 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 which are screwed screws 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.350
 bomb characteristics 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.080
 modification 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.080
 this way this way 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.480
 most often used in marine soups 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 aquariums
