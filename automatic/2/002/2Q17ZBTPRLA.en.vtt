it's<00:00:11.550> nearly<00:00:11.969> instantaneous<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:14.070> also<00:00:14.190> go

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
it's nearly instantaneous I can also go

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000 
it's nearly instantaneous I can also go
to<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> learn<00:00:14.730> tab<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.500> switch<00:00:16.500> between<00:00:16.680> tabs

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.700 
to the learn tab and switch between tabs
and<00:00:17.430> that's<00:00:17.580> also<00:00:17.970> nearly<00:00:18.210> instantaneous<00:00:18.930> I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and that's also nearly instantaneous I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.260 
and that's also nearly instantaneous I
know<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> lot<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> people<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.670> problems<00:00:20.939> with

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the store lagging or the in-game browser

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
the store lagging or the in-game browser
lagging<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.480> wanted<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> show<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
lagging and I just wanted to show you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.290 
lagging and I just wanted to show you
really<00:00:25.260> quick<00:00:25.529> fix<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> get<00:00:27.119> rid<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
really quick fix on how to get rid of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.779 
really quick fix on how to get rid of
that<00:00:27.449> leg<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.859> order<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.670> need

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that leg so in order to do it you need

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.799 
that leg so in order to do it you need
to<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> start<00:00:30.740> control<00:00:31.740> panel<00:00:32.809> Internet

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

Options go to the connections tab go to
land<00:00:37.410> settings<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> make<00:00:38.430> sure<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
unchecked by default this is checked so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
unchecked by default this is checked so
uncheck<00:00:41.910> automatically<00:00:42.540> detect<00:00:42.989> settings

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
uncheck automatically detect settings

uncheck automatically detect settings
click<00:00:44.219> OK<00:00:44.640> click<00:00:44.910> apply<00:00:45.719> ok<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.340> your

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
click OK click apply ok and then your

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
click OK click apply ok and then your
in-game<00:00:48.300> web<00:00:48.989> browser<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.620> really

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
in-game web browser will be really

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
in-game web browser will be really
really<00:00:50.070> fast<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.570> has

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
really fast and I think this even has

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.170 
really fast and I think this even has
some<00:00:51.930> effect<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:53.190> ping<00:00:53.430> inside<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> game

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
some effect on your ping inside the game

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.069 
some effect on your ping inside the game
itself<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.360> second<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.899> reduce

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
itself so the second way you can reduce

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
itself so the second way you can reduce
lag<00:00:58.260> inside<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> game<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> slightly<00:00:59.160> more

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lag inside the game is slightly more

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
lag inside the game is slightly more
complicated<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
complicated but you need to go to this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
get a window that kind of looks like

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
get a window that kind of looks like
this<00:01:08.909> by<00:01:09.180> default<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.689> should<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.110> name

benchmarking<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> does<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> checks

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
benchmarking what this does is it checks

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
benchmarking what this does is it checks

available DNS servers and once you run
the<00:01:18.689> program<00:01:18.900> you'll<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.130> an<00:01:20.250> output<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.700> your

the program you'll get an output in your
web<00:01:21.030> browser<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.360> something<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
web browser or something like this so I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.240 
web browser or something like this so I
just<00:01:23.369> ran<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.600> turns<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.990> that

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
just ran it and it turns out that

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
just ran it and it turns out that
Comcast<00:01:26.390> DNS<00:01:27.390> EC<00:01:27.930> us<00:01:28.259> whatever<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.799> means

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
Comcast DNS EC us whatever that means

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.690 
Comcast DNS EC us whatever that means
DNS<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> 4.1<00:01:30.060> percent<00:01:30.329> faster<00:01:30.720> than<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:32.040> local

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
DNS is 4.1 percent faster than my local

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
DNS is 4.1 percent faster than my local
DNS<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.930> once<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> run<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> you'll<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
DNS so once you run this you'll get the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.999 
DNS so once you run this you'll get the
recommended<00:01:35.610> configuration<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.860> set<00:01:37.860> this

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
recommended configuration here set this

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
recommended configuration here set this

as your DNS configuration in your
network<00:01:40.380> settings<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.250> should<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
network settings and you should get a
