00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
make a really long to like it here and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.510 
make a really long to like it here and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and then you make a handle we have to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
and then you make a handle we have to
make<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> sharper<00:01:02.850> angle<00:01:03.030> because

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
make it out like a sharper angle because

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.940 
make it out like a sharper angle because
it's<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.290> apt<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:09.590> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.799> have

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
