00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.410
 hallÃ¶chen friends of the sun highest time 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.149
 that I keep showing up last time 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.550
 I was only a little bit more 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.260
 by robotics Geheimversteck auf der 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.960
 tip of his gigantic pinball machine 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.699
 Fortress removed as this crazy 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.079
 vollhorst again with help 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.499
 a space shuttle dilutes 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:24.859
 it was up to me to improvise 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.779
 and conjure up a plan b and that 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.609
 Tales not close to me was out 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.039
 to help this misere made the 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.449
 situation not just easier though 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.160
 I was sure that the pinball 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.820
 machine prove useful here 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.449
 could 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.730
 and yes of course she has honest people 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.469
 would have immediately face but 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.539
 when I came through the windows shot 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.940
 better off your mind is told 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.899
 and for a short moment he has me 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.350
 almost sorry 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.120
 Well, almost I broke up the whole 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 spaceship in his items before 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.920
 my favorite ore rival even 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.870
 could only blink to determine 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.879
 that I and robotics were there 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.010
 straight into the ruined fortress 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.550
 to rush in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.830
 what does it think so well in advance? 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.850
 that tales was there to catch me 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.580
 but what Robotnik tackle thanks simply 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.320
 I had less luck anyway 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.780
 was well aware that he was his 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.000
 Club had ever faked that 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.979
 meant he does recognize it again though 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.229
 that does not stop me from one 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.360
 second attempt to plan our vacation 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.490
 and i heard that flick island too 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.229
 This season should be very nice 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.940
 I would think so too 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.409
 other friends the freak was called times 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 to pay a visit 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.950
 but hardly have we landed there 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.899
 we just came across one 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.429
 bert nix and that is a whole armada so 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.350
 Robotics is the pinball fortress 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.039
 actually escape before they get into the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.020
 air goes 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.479
 I bet that something with this 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.340
 mysterious ring to do through the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.800
 How flick is traveling normally 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.060
 who cares i had to meet my friends 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.970
 help them out of this mess again 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 at any price and robotics would the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.539
 have consequences for it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.159
 my previous trip took me from 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.920
 the forests of the island through ancient 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.150
 ruins and such a kind of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.080
 amusement park to the highest glacier 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.780
 of the mountains 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.850
 everything went as smoothly as it did 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.850
 suddenly very lazy 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.760
 Stinking eggs this psychopath wanted ice cream 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.220
 give me a nice robotnik 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.950
 then let's see what you have on the box 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.810
 but you notice my words of this hedgehog 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.810
 will not get cold feet so fast
