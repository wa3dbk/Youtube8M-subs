00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.310 
square ahead down here now it's going to
come<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.590> handy<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:38.090> I'm<00:04:38.270> going<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.690> make<00:04:39.050> this

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
come in handy so I'm going to make this

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.770 
come in handy so I'm going to make this
the<00:04:40.280> first<00:04:40.520> square<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.270> second<00:04:41.630> row

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
the first square and in the second row

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.770 
the first square and in the second row
and<00:04:42.520> because<00:04:43.520> everything<00:04:44.000> will<00:04:44.450> snap<00:04:44.750> into

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
and because everything will snap into

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.850 
and because everything will snap into
place<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.760> don't<00:04:46.760> have<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.120> worry<00:04:47.360> about

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
place I don't have to worry about

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.570 
place I don't have to worry about
placement<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.700> it's<00:04:49.970> they're<00:04:50.300> perfectly<00:04:51.580> ok

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
placement so it's they're perfectly ok

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.490 
placement so it's they're perfectly ok
so<00:04:52.640> we<00:04:52.940> have<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.150> very<00:04:53.300> square<00:04:53.720> now<00:04:53.960> second

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
so we have this very square now second

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.190 
so we have this very square now second
row<00:04:54.650> select<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:56.590> let's<00:04:57.590> go<00:04:57.770> up<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.490> effects

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
row select it and let's go up to effects

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.430 
row select it and let's go up to effects
distort<00:05:00.200> transform<00:05:00.740> transform<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:03.320> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
move section didn't mention that before

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.800 
move section didn't mention that before
not<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.390> scale<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:09.080> we're<00:05:09.950> going<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.160> enter

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810

not to scale and we're going to enter
160<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:12.910> make<00:05:13.910> seven<00:05:14.690> copies<00:05:14.960> as<00:05:15.770> we<00:05:16.100> did

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
160 and make seven copies as we did

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.840 
160 and make seven copies as we did
before<00:05:16.540> preview<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.320> looks<00:05:18.530> great<00:05:18.850> and

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
before preview and it looks great and

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.090 
before preview and it looks great and
I'm<00:05:20.720> going<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.930> click<00:05:21.080> OK<00:05:21.590> I<00:05:21.620> don't<00:05:21.920> have<00:05:22.010> to

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
I'm going to click OK I don't have to

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.560 
I'm going to click OK I don't have to
worry<00:05:22.220> about<00:05:22.340> white<00:05:22.670> squares<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.360> time

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
worry about white squares this time

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.490 
worry about white squares this time
because<00:05:23.720> why<00:05:23.960> it's<00:05:24.110> going<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.290> be<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
because why it's going to be the

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.350 
because why it's going to be the
background<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.220> all<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:25.400> need<00:05:25.430> is<00:05:25.670> one<00:05:26.000> square

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
background so all you need is one square

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.270 
background so all you need is one square
but<00:05:26.630> they<00:05:26.720> still<00:05:26.930> move<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.530> same<00:05:27.740> distance

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
but they still move the same distance

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.180 
but they still move the same distance
now<00:05:28.940> select<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.479> first<00:05:29.990> three<00:05:30.229> squares

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
now select the first three squares

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.110 
now select the first three squares
and<00:05:33.870> going<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.990> go<00:05:35.080> up<00:05:35.520> effects<00:05:36.520> distort

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
and going to go up effects distort

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.440 
and going to go up effects distort
transform<00:05:37.600> transform<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.820> now<00:05:39.820> we<00:05:39.880> want<00:05:40.330> to

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
transform transform and now we want to

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.700 
transform transform and now we want to
move<00:05:41.010> down<00:05:45.270> with<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.110> can<00:05:47.260> create<00:05:47.410> two

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
move down with the so we can create two

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.340 
move down with the so we can create two
rows<00:05:47.980> of<00:05:48.370> each<00:05:48.640> and<00:05:48.850> that<00:05:49.660> still<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.110> going<00:05:50.290> to

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
rows of each and that still is going to

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.330 
rows of each and that still is going to
be<00:05:50.440> 160<00:05:51.400> because<00:05:51.760> eight<00:05:51.910> equals<00:05:52.180> 80<00:05:52.330> is<00:05:52.480> 160

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
be 160 because eight equals 80 is 160

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.690 
be 160 because eight equals 80 is 160
and<00:05:54.340> because<00:05:55.150> we<00:05:55.360> want<00:05:55.570> to<00:05:55.720> move<00:05:55.870> downward<00:05:56.700> we

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
and because we want to move downward we

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.770 
and because we want to move downward we
are<00:05:57.820> going<00:05:58.120> to<00:05:58.330> select<00:06:00.210> vertical<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.450> put

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
are going to select vertical and put

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.040 
are going to select vertical and put
minus<00:06:02.230> 160<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.870> number<00:06:05.140> of<00:06:05.200> copies<00:06:07.050> will

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
minus 160 and the number of copies will

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.270 
minus 160 and the number of copies will
be<00:06:08.170> four<00:06:08.470> and<00:06:09.190> preview<00:06:09.730> it<00:06:09.760> looks<00:06:09.970> great<00:06:10.420> and

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
be four and preview it looks great and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.330 
be four and preview it looks great and
that's<00:06:12.280> it<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.200> I<00:06:14.200> want<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.740> get<00:06:14.860> rid<00:06:15.070> of<00:06:15.100> all

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
that's it so I want to get rid of all

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.070 
that's it so I want to get rid of all
the<00:06:15.520> lines<00:06:15.790> so<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.210> can<00:06:16.330> really<00:06:16.480> see<00:06:16.810> what

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
the lines so you can really see what

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.410 
the lines so you can really see what
this<00:06:17.170> looks<00:06:17.230> like<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.750> let's<00:06:20.080> go<00:06:20.230> up<00:06:21.570> and<00:06:24.420> hide

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
this looks like so let's go up and hide

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.370 
this looks like so let's go up and hide
the<00:06:25.630> guides<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:28.350> hi<00:06:29.350> to<00:06:29.710> grid<00:06:30.130> and<00:06:30.930> great<00:06:31.930> so

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
the guides and hi to grid and great so

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.690 
the guides and hi to grid and great so
this<00:06:32.620> is<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.860> way<00:06:32.920> to<00:06:32.980> final<00:06:33.340> product<00:06:33.670> looks

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
this is the way to final product looks

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.580 
this is the way to final product looks
in<00:06:34.030> Illustrator<00:06:34.540> I<00:06:34.750> did<00:06:34.960> some<00:06:35.110> stuff<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.410> it<00:06:35.500> in

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590
