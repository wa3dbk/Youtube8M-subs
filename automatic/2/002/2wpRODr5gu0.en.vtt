00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.329
 you just 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.350
 you must have access to it and you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.970
 have to totally identify with it 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.560
 and then they can do it 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.649
 they stay so self-sufficient and strong 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.409
 no matter what happens out there but now 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.619
 then somehow it has it's own 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.320
 creates such a world of your own 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 Protected in the way because 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.340
 but she herself is fragile at the same time 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.750
 also admirable of the properties 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.119
 she has herself in the human 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.030
 society by working upwards 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.929
 working in the fbi he is surrounded by 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.929
 somehow wrong 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270
 after all 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.900
 7 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:19.930
 inwardly social awaited 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.670
 realization so 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.050
 not behind not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.700
 and then 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.380
 then I have a little something 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.380
 read and it 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 15 15 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:06.410
 at quite typical if you are old 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.209
 patient alzheimer's patients or too 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.090
 healthy he examines old people that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.370
 the youth especially about childhood 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.519
 Early adulthood does not break now 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.709
 about the present and older one becomes 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.070
 obviously, too 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.550
 the early memory again meaning 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.910
 come back important to say so 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.130
 extreme case would say that is one 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.680
 ask how we relate to our social relationships 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.489
 coded I believe something else again 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.489
 as the question of sexuality experience 

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.489
 certainly 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.900
