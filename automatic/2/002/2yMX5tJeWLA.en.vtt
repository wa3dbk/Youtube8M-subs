00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.599
 It's nice people in this little video, we're going 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.710
 show how to set up a court 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:21.449
 No, I will not, I'll operate with 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 staff this now he had had and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.050
 I'm going to build a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.939
 quadra told claudia that it's a secret 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.430
 that he is a type of fish 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.460
 This is a work of fiction if Claudius is 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.000
 so explaining is that you will return to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.309
 block 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 basically four days after you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.030
 can mount gave the crown since the lawyer 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 it is difficult to have a planted area is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 very beautiful it was a rope tereza 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 that you have a lot of plants 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 flipped over in a match said clyde that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 It is like now and has the Community framework 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.480
 you mix the fish and in and is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.369
 on average for all the configuration of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 take everything away 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.960
 Let's start from scratch because of the flu. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 with staff and other types of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 environment for you to start then 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.680
 now there are some pretty basic steps 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 if you start to put together a good best 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.460
 thing to do with your vote now only 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.259
 defines the type of person you want 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 depending on the type of fish you want 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.880
 but you 'll have to think about the size of the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.680
 block is the substrate that's where you go 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 start with now the great way 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.030
 I recommend you start with the car 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 here in which I who are the fish 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 I work with a little management because 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.799
 works but are the easiest to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.049
 start because they are very 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.250
 resistant as you choose the fish 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.700
 trying to hide the substrate that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.380
 substrate is the background to 4 kind of stone 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 which seems not to but presents 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.350
 influence on fish environment 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.030
 the illumination will go from one dimension 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.130
 appropriate you can not put a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 wall-mounted gift lamp in your 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.990
 now that's the only way I can imagine the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 head having special powers the place 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.200
 more expensive that are making more 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.200
 because we have a white stone and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.850
 sent the pink white wool to clear the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.870
 guard can not the wheel of life light of the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.200
 and the most important part is the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.940
 aquarium filtering is messy 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.690
 so even this type of filter flames 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.050
 anp will make beautiful not only will make the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.459
 Its only functionality is to increase 41 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.860
 cleaning up all this technology will help 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.519
 nation will comment 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.780
 water is a very important thing for 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:50.530
 discover the ph of the water you like 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:53.720
 pay basic basket 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.790
 an example is that I'm going to use here flame 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:08.630
 dolomite and here below written so 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:19.209
 because I 'm cleaning the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:19.209
 stones of the king I filmed this 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.889
 so does not have a rule of the stone is 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.709
 always a pretty rock show that has 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:39.810
 Copacabana fish year I'm used to 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.219
 this time in what is basalt and the domi 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.480
 basalt and neutral ph 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:51.060
 you can cause any kind of 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.439
 court and will not end with you you 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.700
 may be a little bit whiter 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:04:00.930
 normal here because you got one leg 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.329
 stone by placing a stone that does not 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.780
 had before because it was made of 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.659
 white cement in white cement 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.489
 alkaline these vain and new holes 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.969
 cottages that fish because the secret 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.829
 are well tourists is good for what you do 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.840
 is with the disappearance of a time for when 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.509
 have product to fish among them will 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 fight a little more each one the plate 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.240
 plays 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.849
 then each one finds himself only touches nobody 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.560
 disrupt the other character determined 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.840
 here I will finish completing with 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.380
 greater complaint filtering later 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.479
 now she does not wake up late she 's forming 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.490
 one of the four lines no less than something 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.250
 will attack very clean already take a photo 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.550
 itself as a 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.620
 next videos we will record a 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.240
 Fish samba then I'll explain 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.229
 contribution of the cycling that begins 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.550
 happen now 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.860
 I 'll talk later about types of 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.270
 fish with the best you get one 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.520
 aquarium gives some tips for anyone who wants 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.610
 start there goes 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.639
 If you liked selic
