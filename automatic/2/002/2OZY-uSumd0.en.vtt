hi I'm Gina from har Basil's my

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.209 
hi I'm Gina from har Basil's my
demonstration<00:00:10.910> is<00:00:11.150> about<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.719> gravity<00:00:12.289> that

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.130 

creates<00:00:16.219> different<00:00:16.640> song<00:00:16.820> Barbie<00:00:17.630> to<00:00:17.810> pass

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
creates different song Barbie to pass

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.800 
creates different song Barbie to pass
two<00:00:18.410> sides<00:00:18.740> one<00:00:19.310> side<00:00:19.580> has<00:00:19.880> an<00:00:20.029> open<00:00:20.390> end<00:00:20.570> and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
two sides one side has an open end and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.990 
two sides one side has an open end and
the<00:00:21.080> other<00:00:21.230> side<00:00:21.529> has<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.769> closed<00:00:22.130> end<00:00:22.400> there's

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
the other side has a closed end there's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.269 
the other side has a closed end there's
an<00:00:23.150> equation<00:00:23.390> for<00:00:23.779> my<00:00:23.929> demonstration<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:25.070> it

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
an equation for my demonstration and it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.689 
an equation for my demonstration and it
is<00:00:25.429> speed<00:00:25.759> equals<00:00:26.300> frequency<00:00:26.480> times<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
is speed equals frequency times the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.489 
is speed equals frequency times the
speed<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:28.730> sound<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.240> air<00:00:29.269> is<00:00:29.570> constant<00:00:30.169> so<00:00:30.380> if

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
speed of sound in air is constant so if

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.989 
speed of sound in air is constant so if
the<00:00:30.619> wavelength<00:00:30.800> increases<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.849> frequency

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
the wavelength increases the frequency

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.540 
the wavelength increases the frequency
decreases<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.380> speed<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:33.829> sound<00:00:33.860> depends<00:00:34.430> on

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
decreases the speed of sound depends on

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.580 
decreases the speed of sound depends on
the<00:00:34.670> medium<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.270> medium<00:00:35.870> is<00:00:35.989> basically<00:00:36.320> what

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the medium and medium is basically what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.960 
the medium and medium is basically what
waves<00:00:36.800> travel<00:00:37.220> through<00:00:39.670> medium<00:00:40.670> can<00:00:40.850> be

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
waves travel through medium can be

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.330 
waves travel through medium can be
anything<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.840> be<00:00:41.900> air<00:00:42.230> wood<00:00:42.710> metal<00:00:43.040> and

etc open closed end the open end of the
gravity<00:00:54.440> tubes<00:00:54.710> wavelength<00:00:55.280> decreases<00:00:55.540> so<00:00:56.540> it

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
gravity tubes wavelength decreases so it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.810 
gravity tubes wavelength decreases so it
has<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:56.840> higher<00:00:57.200> frequency<00:00:57.560> in<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.250> higher<00:00:58.460> pitch

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
has a higher frequency in a higher pitch

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.060 
has a higher frequency in a higher pitch
pitches<00:00:59.600> basically<00:01:00.110> what<00:01:00.290> our<00:01:00.320> ear<00:01:00.620> perceives

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
pitches basically what our ear perceives

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.800 
pitches basically what our ear perceives
it<00:01:01.400> is<00:01:01.580> not<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:02.060> measurement<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:05.299> closed<00:01:05.570> end

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
it is not a measurement the closed end

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.390 
it is not a measurement the closed end
of<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> gravity<00:01:06.530> tubes<00:01:06.799> wavelength

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
of the gravity tubes wavelength

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.210 
of the gravity tubes wavelength
increases<00:01:07.689> so<00:01:08.689> it<00:01:08.810> has<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> lower<00:01:09.380> pitch<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.040> a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
increases so it has a lower pitch and a

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.780 
increases so it has a lower pitch and a
lower<00:01:10.460> frequency

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.570 

now<00:01:14.330> imagine<00:01:14.780> eight<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.110> Romans<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.160> open

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
now imagine eight the Romans the open

copy - it increases the intensity of the
sound<00:01:36.080> which<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:36.590> called<00:01:36.890> Hamilton<00:01:42.130> even

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
sound which is called Hamilton even

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.610 
sound which is called Hamilton even
though<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.340> hear<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.850> louder<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:45.020> wavelength

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
though you hear it louder the wavelength

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.360 
though you hear it louder the wavelength
and<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.980> frequency<00:01:46.070> doesn't<00:01:46.910> change<00:01:48.220> did<00:01:49.220> you

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
and the frequency doesn't change did you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.040 
and the frequency doesn't change did you
know<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.970> gravity<00:01:50.330> -<00:01:50.510> relates<00:01:50.869> to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
know that the gravity - relates to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.140 
know that the gravity - relates to
history<00:01:53.470> when<00:01:54.470> instruments<00:01:55.220> such<00:01:55.610> as<00:01:55.640> flute

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
history when instruments such as flute

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.790 
history when instruments such as flute
and<00:01:56.390> saxophone<00:01:56.750> relates<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.680> my

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
and saxophone relates to my

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.280 
and saxophone relates to my
demonstration<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:59.119> example<00:01:59.540> if<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.840> cover<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
demonstration for example if I cover the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.050 
demonstration for example if I cover the
lower<00:02:00.470> end<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.010> flute<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.490> my<00:02:01.640> fingers

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
lower end of the flute with my fingers

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.390 
lower end of the flute with my fingers
it<00:02:02.420> will<00:02:02.660> have<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.840> lower<00:02:03.170> pitch<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.250> is

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
it will have a lower pitch and that is

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.150 
it will have a lower pitch and that is
because<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.910> weight<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.979> chose<00:02:06.979> my

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
because the weight I chose my

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.800 
because the weight I chose my
demonstration<00:02:07.880> because<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.450> sounds<00:02:08.780> really

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
demonstration because it sounds really

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.350 
demonstration because it sounds really
good<00:02:09.229> at<00:02:10.130> first<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.580> didn't<00:02:10.790> know<00:02:10.820> anything

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
good at first I didn't know anything

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.180 
good at first I didn't know anything
about<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.720> gravity<00:02:12.110> -<00:02:12.320> like<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.860> didn't<00:02:13.040> even

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
about the gravity - like I didn't even

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.070 
about the gravity - like I didn't even
know<00:02:13.340> there<00:02:13.490> was<00:02:13.580> an<00:02:13.730> equation<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.420> but

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
know there was an equation for this but

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.170 
know there was an equation for this but
now<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.560> learned<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.130> lot<00:02:16.280> about<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.670> robbery<00:02:17.000> -

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
now I learned a lot about the robbery -

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.600 
now I learned a lot about the robbery -
like<00:02:17.420> how<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.720> works<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.230> Harley's<00:02:18.860> history<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
like how it works in Harley's history I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.280 
like how it works in Harley's history I
also<00:02:20.090> found<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.600> funny<00:02:20.840> video

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
also found a funny video

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
also found a funny video
which<00:02:21.590> was

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.850 

check<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.180> out<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.720> was<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.470> store<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
check it out I was in the store the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.729 
check it out I was in the store the
other<00:02:33.890> day<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:35.110> me<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.200> my<00:02:36.290> brothers<00:02:36.650> was

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
other day and me and my brothers was

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.759 
other day and me and my brothers was
playing<00:02:37.010> around<00:02:37.159> with<00:02:37.370> toys<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.780> found<00:02:39.049> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
playing around with toys and I found the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.780 
playing around with toys and I found the
greatest<00:02:40.010> thing

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
greatest thing

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.930 
greatest thing
yeah<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.450> gravity
