think<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.500> deck<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.830> everybody

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
think this is a deck that everybody

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.970 
think this is a deck that everybody
should<00:02:16.490> play<00:02:16.850> for<00:02:17.180> WC<00:02:17.690> cute<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.920> is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
should play for WC cute I think this is

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.100 
should play for WC cute I think this is
the<00:02:19.250> jack<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.490> people<00:02:19.940> should<00:02:20.120> be<00:02:20.150> prepared

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the jack that people should be prepared

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.470 
the jack that people should be prepared
for<00:02:21.170> because<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> lot<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.100> people<00:02:22.220> don't<00:02:23.180> know

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
for because a lot of people don't know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.330 
for because a lot of people don't know
how<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.020> play<00:02:24.260> against<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> deck<00:02:24.770> efficiently

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
how to play against the deck efficiently

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.100 
how to play against the deck efficiently
so<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.270> people<00:02:26.360> should<00:02:26.510> be<00:02:26.750> practicing

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
so I think people should be practicing

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.449 
so I think people should be practicing
against<00:02:27.380> attacks<00:02:27.620> especially<00:02:27.770> since<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
against attacks especially since the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.100 
against attacks especially since the
fact<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.760> they're<00:02:29.000> gaining

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
fact that they're gaining

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.720 
fact that they're gaining
I<00:02:30.170> feel<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.770> one<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> best<00:02:31.340> sport<00:02:31.700> vines
