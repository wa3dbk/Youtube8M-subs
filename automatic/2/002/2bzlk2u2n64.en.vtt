these centuries so let's go ahead and
take<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.230> away<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.399> any<00:00:32.700> Killzone<00:00:33.149> 2<00:00:33.300> when

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
take it away yeah so any Killzone 2 when
we<00:00:33.870> were<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> competitive<00:00:34.440> scene<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.640> job

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
engineer role and with this role I ran

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
engineer role and with this role I ran
around<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.309> shotgun<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.239> main

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
around with a shotgun but my main

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and we know in the kill zone community

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560 
and we know in the kill zone community
refer<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.930> bots<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:50.210> these<00:00:51.210> bots

from<00:00:52.110> Killzone<00:00:52.469> 2<00:00:52.559> changed<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.520> o

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
from Killzone 2 changed a little bit o

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.750 
from Killzone 2 changed a little bit o
in<00:00:53.850> Killzone<00:00:54.449> 3<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.289> change<00:00:55.649> again<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
in Killzone 3 and then change again and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
in Killzone 3 and then change again and
killzone<00:00:57.120> shadow<00:00:57.390> fall<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.809> today<00:00:58.079> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
killzone shadow fall so today that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.260 
killzone shadow fall so today that's
what<00:00:58.680> we're<00:00:58.770> gonna<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.949> talking<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.460> yeah

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
what we're gonna be talking about yeah

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
what we're gonna be talking about yeah
and<00:01:00.510> essentially<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.500> looking<00:01:01.859> at

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and essentially what you're looking at

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
and essentially what you're looking at
and<00:01:01.949> kills<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.940> way<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.149> place<00:01:03.510> them

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and kills on to the way you place them

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
and kills on to the way you place them
at<00:01:03.780> least<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:04.979> hitting<00:01:05.489> left<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
at least was by hitting left on the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.870 
at least was by hitting left on the
d-pad<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.229> would<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.590> about<00:01:07.850> two<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
d-pad and it would take about two to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.370 
d-pad and it would take about two to
three<00:01:09.000> seconds<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.689> sure<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> exact

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
three seconds I'm not sure the exact

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
three seconds I'm not sure the exact
time<00:01:10.619> you'll<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> footage

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
time you'll see right on the footage

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
time you'll see right on the footage
right<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.479> yourself

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
right here so you can see for yourself

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
right here so you can see for yourself
it<00:01:13.170> takes<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.830> few<00:01:13.979> seconds<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> plant<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it takes a few seconds to plant them and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
it takes a few seconds to plant them and
as<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> plant<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.860> pretty

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
as you plant them you're pretty

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010 
as you plant them you're pretty
vulnerable<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.450> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> something

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
vulnerable and that's kind of something

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
vulnerable and that's kind of something
that<00:01:19.280> was<00:01:20.280> always<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.939> difficult<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that was always really difficult for the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.120 
that was always really difficult for the
engineer<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.259> once<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> would<00:01:23.040> get

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
engineer you know once you would get

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.499 
engineer you know once you would get
this<00:01:23.280> turd<00:01:23.490> up<00:01:23.670> sure<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.330> pretty

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this turd up sure it could be pretty

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
this turd up sure it could be pretty
deadly<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.080> would<00:01:25.170> help<00:01:25.290> shoot<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.740> air<00:01:26.280> bots

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
deadly it would help shoot down air bots

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
deadly it would help shoot down air bots
and<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.240> stuff<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.750> while<00:01:28.439> you're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and all that good stuff but while you're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.480 
and all that good stuff but while you're
placing<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.400> bit

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
placing it you're a little bit

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
placing it you're a little bit
vulnerable<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.630> made<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.110> similar

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
vulnerable and they made it very similar

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920 
vulnerable and they made it very similar
in<00:01:31.590> Killzone<00:01:32.369> 3<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.270> change<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
in Killzone 3 so not much change the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
in Killzone 3 so not much change the
only<00:01:34.140> thing<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.530> different<00:01:34.680> about

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
only thing that was different about

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
only thing that was different about
Killzone<00:01:35.400> 3<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.570> three

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
Killzone 3 was that there was three

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
Killzone 3 was that there was three
different<00:01:37.170> levels<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> bots<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.400> like

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
different levels of bots and just like

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.740 
different levels of bots and just like
anything<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.030> killzone<00:01:39.299> 3<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> could

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
anything and killzone 3 you could

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.819 
anything and killzone 3 you could
upgrade<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.950> particular<00:01:41.670> support<00:01:42.630> um<00:01:42.829> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
upgrade your particular support um you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.219 
upgrade your particular support um you
know<00:01:43.950> perks<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.909> essentially<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.079> could

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
know perks so essentially you could

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
know perks so essentially you could
start<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> bots<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.189> pretty<00:01:47.430> weak<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
start out the bots was pretty weak and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
start out the bots was pretty weak and
useless<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> upgraded<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.920> shot

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
useless and then you upgraded it it shot

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
useless and then you upgraded it it shot
a<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.490> better<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.360> upgrade<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
a little better and then you upgrade it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
a little better and then you upgrade it
again<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.950> missiles

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
again and then it actually got missiles

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
again and then it actually got missiles
that<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.850> hit<00:01:54.540> people<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:54.990> face<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.500> air

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that would hit people in the face or air

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.580 
that would hit people in the face or air
bots<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.390> killzone<00:01:57.750> shadowfall<00:01:58.170> things

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
bots so and killzone shadowfall things

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.929 
bots so and killzone shadowfall things
work<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.100> different<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.850> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
work a little different so what have you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
work a little different so what have you
seen<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> footage<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.560> we've

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
seen kind of in the footage that we've

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
seen kind of in the footage that we've
been<00:02:01.979> using<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> seen<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.840> far<00:02:04.049> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
been using what have you seen as far as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
been using what have you seen as far as
differences<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> killzone<00:02:05.250> shadow<00:02:05.520> fall

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
differences and killzone shadow fall

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.609 
differences and killzone shadow fall
well<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> first<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:07.229> obvious

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
well the first thing that's very obvious

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.800 
well the first thing that's very obvious

that I I've noticed right away is that
the<00:02:10.080> bots<00:02:10.349> look<00:02:10.800> be

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
the bots look be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
found a new strategy to approach the gun

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.470 
found a new strategy to approach the gun
fight<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.920> he<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> first<00:02:34.390> thing

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
but they look wider and you can kind of

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.840 
but they look wider and you can kind of
use<00:02:38.560> them<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.960> things<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.460> shield<00:02:42.460> your<00:02:42.640> body

and we don't know exactly how it's going
to<00:04:15.519> work<00:04:15.580> in<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:15.850> game<00:04:16.060> there's<00:04:16.600> just

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
to work in this game there's just

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.930 
to work in this game there's just
literally<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:18.040> split<00:04:18.430> second<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.790> footage

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
literally a split second of footage

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.849 
literally a split second of footage
where<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.299> looks<00:04:19.450> like<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.930> century<00:04:20.289> might<00:04:20.650> be

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
where it looks like the century might be

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.039 
where it looks like the century might be
shooting<00:04:21.340> at<00:04:21.489> an<00:04:21.640> air

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
shooting at an air

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.080 
shooting at an air
but<00:04:22.650> other<00:04:22.830> than<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.099> it<00:04:23.550> seems<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
but other than that it seems to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.969 
but other than that it seems to
completely<00:04:24.569> ignore<00:04:24.780> them<00:04:25.229> now<00:04:25.620> i<00:04:25.650> don't<00:04:25.800> know

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
completely ignore them now i don't know

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.619 
completely ignore them now i don't know
if<00:04:26.069> it's<00:04:26.190> taking<00:04:26.520> high-priority<00:04:27.000> targets

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
if it's taking high-priority targets

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.899 
if it's taking high-priority targets
over<00:04:27.870> air<00:04:28.349> bots<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.370> obviously<00:04:29.550> if

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
over air bots you know obviously if

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:31.460 
over air bots you know obviously if
there's<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.150> person<00:04:30.479> running<00:04:30.629> at<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.900> it's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
there's a person running at you it's

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.020 
there's a person running at you it's
going<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.919> more<00:04:32.129> dangerous<00:04:32.370> than<00:04:32.729> an<00:04:32.849> air

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
going to be more dangerous than an air

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.089 
going to be more dangerous than an air
by<00:04:33.180> shooting<00:04:33.629> in<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.590> three-shot

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
by shooting in you know three-shot

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.059 
by shooting in you know three-shot
bursts<00:04:35.520> every<00:04:36.479> couple<00:04:36.990> seconds<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.919> is

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
bursts every couple seconds so it is

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.159 
bursts every couple seconds so it is
more<00:04:38.430> dangerous<00:04:38.669> for<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.120> person<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.659> the

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169

arrow bot flew anywhere in the vicinity
the<00:05:00.300> ground<00:05:00.629> bot<00:05:00.900> would<00:05:01.139> just<00:05:01.409> start<00:05:01.650> spamming

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
the ground bot would just start spamming

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.820 
the ground bot would just start spamming
rockets<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.509> things<00:05:04.139> would<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.500> get

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
rockets and things would just get

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.589 
rockets and things would just get
destroyed<00:05:05.250> if<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:05.849> happen<00:05:05.969> to<00:05:06.180> be<00:05:06.300> in<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.479> way

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
destroyed if you happen to be in the way

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.260 
destroyed if you happen to be in the way
your<00:05:06.900> own<00:05:07.110> teams<00:05:07.560> bot<00:05:07.860> would<00:05:08.069> kill<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.580> just

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
your own teams bot would kill you just

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.830 
your own teams bot would kill you just
very<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.990> was<00:05:10.110> very<00:05:10.849> sensitive<00:05:11.849> to<00:05:12.240> other<00:05:12.509> BOTS

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
very it was very sensitive to other BOTS

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.029 
very it was very sensitive to other BOTS
around<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.370> game<00:05:14.810> we<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:16.349> a<00:05:16.379> bot<00:05:16.740> on

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
around and in this game we have a bot on

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.189 
around and in this game we have a bot on
the<00:05:17.879> ledge<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.449> there's<00:05:18.750> an<00:05:18.870> arrow<00:05:19.050> bot

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
the ledge and there's an arrow bot

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.499 
the ledge and there's an arrow bot
flying<00:05:19.469> over<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.099> for<00:05:20.280> about<00:05:20.460> 5-6<00:05:21.090> seconds

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
flying over and for about 5-6 seconds

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.930 
flying over and for about 5-6 seconds
there<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.139> don't<00:05:22.319> see<00:05:22.800> one<00:05:23.190> missile<00:05:23.669> so<00:05:23.849> I'm

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
there I don't see one missile so I'm

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.490 
there I don't see one missile so I'm
really<00:05:24.620> confused<00:05:25.620> almost<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.849> way<00:05:27.180> it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
really confused almost the way it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.140 
really confused almost the way it
decides<00:05:28.500> what<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:28.949> shoot<00:05:29.190> at<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.819> don't

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
decides what to shoot at and I don't

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.490 
decides what to shoot at and I don't
even<00:05:30.180> know<00:05:30.419> if<00:05:30.449> they<00:05:30.599> have<00:05:30.750> missiles<00:05:31.139> anymore

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
even know if they have missiles anymore

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.399 
even know if they have missiles anymore
at<00:05:31.590> all<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:32.009> might<00:05:32.370> just<00:05:32.610> shoot<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:33.000> gun<00:05:33.409> and

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
at all it might just shoot a gun and

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.680 
at all it might just shoot a gun and
bullets<00:05:34.800> at<00:05:35.039> the<00:05:35.279> air<00:05:35.430> but<00:05:35.669> not<00:05:36.210> really<00:05:36.419> sure

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
bullets at the air but not really sure

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.600 
bullets at the air but not really sure
how<00:05:36.930> that's<00:05:37.139> going<00:05:37.319> to<00:05:37.440> play<00:05:37.529> out<00:05:37.710> yeah<00:05:38.460> we

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
how that's going to play out yeah we

how that's going to play out yeah we
don't<00:05:38.789> know<00:05:38.940> we<00:05:39.690> have<00:05:39.779> not<00:05:40.020> confirmed<00:05:40.500> there's

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
don't know we have not confirmed there's

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.100 
don't know we have not confirmed there's
missiles<00:05:41.250> at<00:05:41.400> all<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.759> would<00:05:42.419> actually<00:05:42.539> like<00:05:42.930> it

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
missiles at all I would actually like it

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.620 
missiles at all I would actually like it
if<00:05:43.289> there<00:05:43.469> weren't<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:44.039> mean<00:05:44.460> like<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.479> said

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
if there weren't I mean like you said

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.730 
if there weren't I mean like you said

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
you would actually get shot in the face

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.589 
you would actually get shot in the face
by<00:05:46.979> your<00:05:47.219> own<00:05:47.460> teammates<00:05:47.969> and<00:05:48.090> missiles<00:05:48.419> as

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
by your own teammates and missiles as

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.839 
by your own teammates and missiles as
they<00:05:48.719> were<00:05:48.810> trying<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.050> shoot<00:05:49.199> down<00:05:49.319> ere<00:05:49.529> BOTS

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
they were trying to shoot down ere BOTS

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.010 
they were trying to shoot down ere BOTS
if<00:05:50.849> you're<00:05:51.060> on<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.270> Ledge<00:05:51.449> or<00:05:51.629> something<00:05:51.930> like

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
if you're on a Ledge or something like

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.260 
if you're on a Ledge or something like
that<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:52.229> it<00:05:52.500> was<00:05:52.620> kind<00:05:52.860> of<00:05:52.919> ridiculous<00:05:53.270> also

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
that so it was kind of ridiculous also

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.700 
that so it was kind of ridiculous also
one<00:05:54.419> other<00:05:54.449> thing<00:05:54.719> that<00:05:54.750> we<00:05:54.900> haven't<00:05:55.229> seen<00:05:55.469> and

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
one other thing that we haven't seen and

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.040 
one other thing that we haven't seen and
we're<00:05:55.860> glad<00:05:56.099> we<00:05:56.129> haven't<00:05:56.550> seen<00:05:56.759> our<00:05:57.050> head

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
we're glad we haven't seen our head

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.290 
we're glad we haven't seen our head
shots<00:05:58.349> from<00:05:58.590> bots<00:05:58.860> because<00:05:59.669> that<00:05:59.819> was<00:05:59.909> a<00:05:59.940> huge

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
shots from bots because that was a huge

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.930 
shots from bots because that was a huge
issue<00:06:00.680> mostly<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:01.800> killzone<00:06:02.250> 2<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.759> could

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
issue mostly in killzone 2 you could

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.459 
issue mostly in killzone 2 you could
place<00:06:03.120> your<00:06:03.330> bot<00:06:03.479> in<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:04.020> certain<00:06:04.259> position

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
place your bot in a certain position

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.320 
place your bot in a certain position
over<00:06:05.219> a<00:06:05.250> Ledge<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:05.759> it<00:06:05.969> would<00:06:06.060> shoot

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
over a Ledge and it would shoot

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.050 
over a Ledge and it would shoot
perfectly<00:06:07.289> at<00:06:07.469> the<00:06:07.680> right<00:06:07.949> angle<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:09.029> shoot

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
perfectly at the right angle to shoot

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.110 
perfectly at the right angle to shoot
vases<00:06:09.690> off<00:06:09.840> now<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.349> became<00:06:10.889> something<00:06:11.879> that

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
vases off now it became something that

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.399 
vases off now it became something that
you<00:06:12.210> could<00:06:12.330> exploit<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:12.930> something<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.319> you

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
you could exploit and something that you

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.809 
you could exploit and something that you
could<00:06:13.529> actually<00:06:13.560> do<00:06:13.979> yourself<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:14.699> do

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
could actually do yourself and do

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.180 
could actually do yourself and do
purposely<00:06:15.389> but<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.560> was<00:06:16.680> just<00:06:16.710> kind<00:06:17.039> of<00:06:17.069> an

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
purposely but it was just kind of an

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.529 
purposely but it was just kind of an
annoyance<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:17.729> know<00:06:17.819> I<00:06:17.849> don't<00:06:18.090> think<00:06:18.270> a<00:06:18.330> bot

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
annoyance you know I don't think a bot

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.390 
annoyance you know I don't think a bot
should<00:06:18.870> have<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.259> much<00:06:19.289> power<00:06:19.529> I<00:06:20.009> don't

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
should have that much power I don't

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.350 
should have that much power I don't
think<00:06:20.430> I<00:06:20.580> should<00:06:20.699> be<00:06:20.789> able<00:06:20.849> to<00:06:20.969> take<00:06:21.120> people

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
think I should be able to take people

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360 
think I should be able to take people
out<00:06:21.449> that<00:06:21.690> quickly<00:06:22.020> so<00:06:22.379> that's<00:06:23.009> just<00:06:23.159> kind<00:06:23.340> of

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
out that quickly so that's just kind of

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.700 
out that quickly so that's just kind of
my<00:06:23.430> two<00:06:23.580> cents<00:06:24.060> but<00:06:24.330> these<00:06:24.870> bots<00:06:25.139> have<00:06:25.349> changed

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
my two cents but these bots have changed

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.309 
my two cents but these bots have changed
quite<00:06:25.770> a<00:06:25.919> bit<00:06:25.979> and<00:06:26.310> I<00:06:26.940> think<00:06:27.240> there<00:06:27.389> that<00:06:27.900> you

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
quite a bit and I think there that you

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.689 
quite a bit and I think there that you
know<00:06:28.409> as<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.919> game<00:06:29.069> goes<00:06:29.219> on<00:06:29.340> there<00:06:29.520> going<00:06:29.639> to

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
know as the game goes on there going to

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.010 
know as the game goes on there going to
be<00:06:29.759> able<00:06:29.819> to<00:06:29.940> balance<00:06:30.089> them<00:06:30.449> they<00:06:30.570> did<00:06:30.810> in<00:06:30.930> the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
be able to balance them they did in the

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.650 
be able to balance them they did in the
past<00:06:31.199> game

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
past game

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.750 
past game
you<00:06:31.840> know<00:06:31.960> they<00:06:32.110> figured<00:06:32.650> out<00:06:32.770> exactly<00:06:33.400> how

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
you know they figured out exactly how

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.790 
you know they figured out exactly how
strong<00:06:34.060> they<00:06:34.180> should<00:06:34.330> be<00:06:34.620> that's<00:06:35.620> something

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
strong they should be that's something

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.500 
strong they should be that's something
is<00:06:36.100> going<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.400> change<00:06:36.580> as<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.030> game<00:06:37.150> launches

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
is going to change as the game launches
