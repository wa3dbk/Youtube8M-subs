over so then I started thinking what's

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.349 
over so then I started thinking what's
global<00:03:29.519> because<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> Internet<00:03:30.419> is<00:03:30.919> basically

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
global because the Internet is basically

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.640 
global because the Internet is basically
almost<00:03:33.359> infinite<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:33.959> mean<00:03:34.169> goes<00:03:34.290> everywhere

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
almost infinite I mean goes everywhere

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.949 
almost infinite I mean goes everywhere
so<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> thought<00:03:35.699> what<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.060> global<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.629> Internet

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
so I thought what is global the Internet

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.009 
so I thought what is global the Internet
is<00:03:37.049> global<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.620> reaches<00:03:37.949> across<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:39.239> country

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
is global it reaches across this country

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.920 
is global it reaches across this country
and<00:03:40.579> then<00:03:41.579> what<00:03:41.790> else<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.090> global<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.569> decided

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and then what else is global I decided

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.869 
and then what else is global I decided
that<00:03:44.540> people<00:03:45.540> want<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.560> relax<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.669> at
