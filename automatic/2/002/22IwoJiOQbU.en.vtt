while there's plenty of room in the toe

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.050 
while there's plenty of room in the toe
box<00:00:36.260> for<00:00:36.710> my<00:00:36.800> feet<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.220> my<00:00:37.340> toes<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.790> spread

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
and move around as I ran when I was

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.260 
and move around as I ran when I was
standing<00:00:40.040> still<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.550> tried<00:00:40.730> them<00:00:40.910> on<00:00:41.090> I

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
standing still and tried them on I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.430 
standing still and tried them on I
actually<00:00:41.450> thought<00:00:41.720> there<00:00:41.840> was<00:00:41.960> too<00:00:42.230> much

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
actually thought there was too much

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.860 
actually thought there was too much
space<00:00:42.770> in<00:00:43.150> maybe<00:00:44.150> I<00:00:44.240> had<00:00:44.390> gotten<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.720> wrong

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
space in maybe I had gotten the wrong

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.290 
space in maybe I had gotten the wrong
size<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.320> need<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:45.680> down<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:45.980> size<00:00:46.310> but<00:00:46.910> once<00:00:47.150> I

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
size I need to go down a size but once I

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.610 
size I need to go down a size but once I
was<00:00:47.420> out<00:00:47.510> there<00:00:47.690> running<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.020> realized<00:00:48.440> that

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
was out there running I realized that

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.260 
was out there running I realized that
that<00:00:48.740> extra<00:00:49.010> space<00:00:49.280> came<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.670> handy<00:00:50.030> for<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
that extra space came in handy for a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.490 
that extra space came in handy for a
toast<00:00:50.720> play<00:00:51.460> she<00:00:52.460> was<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.580> lot<00:00:52.880> of<00:00:52.910> fun<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.450> like<00:00:54.380> I

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
toast play she was a lot of fun I like I

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
said I enjoyed it more than I thought I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.910 
said I enjoyed it more than I thought I

or<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.280> may<00:01:49.430> just<00:01:49.640> always<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:50.120> something<00:01:50.450> that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600

would<00:01:50.920> create<00:01:51.920> some<00:01:52.190> discomfort<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:53.360> overall

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
would create some discomfort but overall

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.050 
would create some discomfort but overall
fun<00:01:54.380> shoe<00:01:54.680> really<00:01:54.979> enjoyed<00:01:55.430> running<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.940> them

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060

as<00:01:57.049> far<00:01:57.350> as<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> minimal<00:01:57.950> experience<00:01:58.520> goes

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
as far as a minimal experience goes

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.510 
as far as a minimal experience goes
is<00:01:59.460> probably<00:02:01.070> one<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.369> enjoyable

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is probably one of the more enjoyable
