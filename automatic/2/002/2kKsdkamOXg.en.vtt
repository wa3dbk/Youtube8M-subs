surgery in all honesty mainly because of
the<00:03:50.390> girls<00:03:50.599> there<00:03:51.530> though<00:03:51.769> if<00:03:52.069> there's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
the girls there though if there's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.119 
the girls there though if there's
anything<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.090> i<00:03:53.599> might<00:03:54.170> have<00:03:54.379> distressed

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
anything that i might have distressed

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.740 
anything that i might have distressed
dates<00:03:55.400> about<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.359> be<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.540> girls

dates about it's going to be the girls

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.740 
dates about it's going to be the girls
but<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.560> know<00:03:57.680> there<00:03:57.950> are<00:03:58.269> good<00:03:59.269> bras<00:03:59.510> out

but you know there are good bras out
there<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.099> that's<00:04:01.310> not<00:04:01.579> really<00:04:02.090> a

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329

surgery

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.200 

I<00:04:53.320> think<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:54.250> important<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.670> we<00:04:54.760> start<00:04:55.000> to

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
I think it's important that we start to

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.690 
I think it's important that we start to
keep<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.450> positive<00:04:55.600> attitude<00:04:56.460> that's<00:04:57.460> so

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
keep a positive attitude that's so

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.400 
keep a positive attitude that's so
important<00:04:58.120> because<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:59.020> day<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.170> going<00:04:59.380> to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
important because the day is going to

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.560 
important because the day is going to
come<00:04:59.590> when<00:04:59.800> this<00:04:59.980> body<00:05:00.220> closes<00:05:01.000> its<00:05:01.150> eyes<00:05:01.300> and

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
come when this body closes its eyes and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.450 
come when this body closes its eyes and
goes<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.870> sleep<00:05:01.900> forever<00:05:02.230> and<00:05:02.710> it's<00:05:03.340> our

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
goes to sleep forever and it's our

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.790 
goes to sleep forever and it's our
attitude<00:05:04.000> that's<00:05:04.450> our<00:05:04.600> legacy<00:05:05.050> it's<00:05:05.560> what<00:05:05.710> we

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
attitude that's our legacy it's what we

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.440 
attitude that's our legacy it's what we
be<00:05:05.890> behind<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.970> what's<00:05:07.150> wrong<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.420> being

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
be behind so what's wrong with being

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.590 
be behind so what's wrong with being
positive<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.080> spreading<00:05:08.470> some<00:05:08.650> positivity

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
positive and spreading some positivity

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.620 
positive and spreading some positivity
