00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.440
 weekers 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.950
 you can go out 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 the costumes 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.389
 the office is very common 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.389
 and of course also for the judge 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 according to molyneux 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.249
 you will never be at the door 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.789
 this one 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 I received credit 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.190
 no 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.190

 the knowledge tunnel through debt 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 that that doesn't happen 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 that's the traffic 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.530
 It is natural 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 the mails sent 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.820
 the course of mainz went 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.250
 presumably he is home again because nobody 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.150
 so for now it is how it works 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 I will never be 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.520

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.539

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.970
 the experienced 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.500
 I know 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.980
 the 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.280
 when I 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 no 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 it is very hard 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.390
 at all banks 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 Belgium 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.659
 an advance 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.469

 a resident of a home 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.709
 the discussion about their boats sailing 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.309
 the Westlander 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.869
 it's a tough evening 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.719
 after Ramadan 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.839
 it's peace 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.599

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.599
 philips man wants to go after that 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.879
