00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.809
 hello to all real boys found in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 channel I am classic in 68 and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.430
 finally guys I did it are 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.770
 managed to see the fifth episode 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.509
 of the super combo obviously as soon as I have 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.340
 found a free wifi line for boys 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.890
 I immediately shot it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 bet and so we are ready to hear 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.610
 my opinions on this is obviously 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 I remind you to leave me a little comment 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 to let me know what you think about it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.670
 about life then 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 let's start immediately with the rare undergoes a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.530
 little bit the episode then we knew more or 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.720
 less than what the episode was 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.549
 that is, of the fact that there is anyway 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.970
 arrived on the planet of recale oe 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:54.030
 he was going to challenge then goku this 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.739
 phantom super sayan gold of course 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 coop not knowing anything about this super 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.269
 gold is still the wall of the site 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.210
 lord bis power and therefore will challenge him 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.400
 in a fight and obviously us already 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.049
 we knew well or badly having also seen 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.979
 the film of course I appeal to those who have it 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.360
 seen 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 there as it will be of how it ended 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 for better or worse, the fight with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.820
 since it devastated a few however 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 practically fails to hit him 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 not even once 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 indeed, fossils, however, succeed in striking it at 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.410
 end effects bis you want to hit e 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.210
 so this is more or less the story 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 of the episode is how it moves 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 ramallah regarding the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.070
 fighting I have to tell the truth 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.380
 at first it started a little bit in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.360
 muted then row when already as it is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.010
 transformed into a third-level super 6 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 that is, I liked it a little bit more 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.630
 become more enjoyable in a sense 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.940
 but guys the weird thing about 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.620
 this episode and that was really noticed 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.630
 what designs do not come from the hand of 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.880
 refiners love but from another of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.620
 signatures, however, still the thing 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.400
 stranger is that the drawings were 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.170
 really really horrible in certain scenes 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.760
 I do not say in the whole episode however in 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.010
 some scenes of the fighting the quarry 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.720
 when he became super sayan is 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.020
 started fighting with distracting i 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.179
 drawings were 20 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.750
 really something unwatchable that is 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.149
 the characters crippled just at the limit 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 ridiculous in something incredible 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.500
 that is, believe me never really Racano 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.569
 seen a little flourishing than that though 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.580
 I hope it's a passing thing because 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.200
 sincerely in the past episodes i 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.910
 drawings I liked I have to say the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.739
 life you could see that they were not gods 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.569
 shooters love for guys really into 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.730
 this episode I noticed that you are drawing 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.170
 they were in something horrible 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.090
 leaving out with that part of the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 design that I hope is one thing anyway 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.010
 absolutely temporary considering that in the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 anyway I have not noticed anyway 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.090
 this thing 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.280
 we continue further and of course we have 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.920
 the changed pressure in which the artist 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.560
 it reveals on the earth and therefore on the yacht 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.750
 if I'm not mistaken in shape then 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.610
 we know it has changed location 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.280
 to the film in the film was the capsule 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.349
 corporation the party instead here in July 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.690
 girls really a small thing 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.260
 but let's see how it will continue 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.140
 rare 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.269
 at this point I can only wish 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.829
 drawings improve a little bit more 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.889
 compared to this episode because really 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.930
 here the smart has been touched as well as in the 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.090
 past episodes I didn't like them instead 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.970
 I liked it a lot though here 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.079
 really thinks something has happened 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.250
 strange 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.230
 okay guys my reactions anyway 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.549

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.989
 comment on what you think of this 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.430
 episode let me know about the drawings 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.170

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.640
