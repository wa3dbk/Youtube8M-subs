next six months everyone was laughing at

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.620 
next six months everyone was laughing at
me<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> BBC<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.130> i<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.240> beginning

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
me a BBC and now i think the beginning

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.849 
me a BBC and now i think the beginning
to<00:00:27.720> hide<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.199> bit<00:00:28.320> cuz<00:00:28.439> i<00:00:28.500> actually

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to hide a little bit cuz i actually

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.450 
to hide a little bit cuz i actually
think<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.369> catch<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:29.970> city<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.890> finish

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
think we can catch one city and finish

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.620 
think we can catch one city and finish
second<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.120> tight<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.570> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
second it's going to be tight and you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240 
second it's going to be tight and you
know<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:34.079> only<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> few<00:00:34.649> points<00:00:35.070> between

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
know there's only a few points between

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
know there's only a few points between
it<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.360> United<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.840> we're<00:00:36.989> hitting

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it but I think United now we're hitting

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
it but I think United now we're hitting
top<00:00:37.440> four<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.309> city<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.940> top

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
