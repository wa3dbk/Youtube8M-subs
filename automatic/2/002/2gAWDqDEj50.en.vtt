00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.270 
reflects the light back down because I
was<00:01:59.369> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.909> LED<00:02:00.110> rather<00:02:01.110> than<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
was going to use an LED rather than the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.679 
was going to use an LED rather than the
lights<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
lights and what I have here is I have a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
lights and what I have here is I have a
temporary<00:02:04.049> base<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> work

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
temporary base that I make when I work

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.830 
temporary base that I make when I work
on

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
on

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.550 
on
when<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.079> carve<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.340> base<00:02:07.549> I'll<00:02:07.909> put<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
when I carve and this base I'll put the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.380 
when I carve and this base I'll put the
little<00:02:09.560> bone<00:02:09.739> on<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.150> I'll<00:02:11.239> go

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
little bone on that and then I'll go

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110 
little bone on that and then I'll go
ahead<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.660> turn<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.670> you'll<00:02:13.849> see<00:02:14.030> it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
ahead and turn it on and you'll see it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.699 
ahead and turn it on and you'll see it
lights<00:02:14.300> up<00:02:14.450> real<00:02:14.660> nice<00:02:14.840> I'll<00:02:15.319> turn<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> light

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
lights up real nice I'll turn a light

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.979 
lights up real nice I'll turn a light
off<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> minute<00:02:16.069> but<00:02:16.760> it'll<00:02:17.330> show<00:02:17.599> me<00:02:17.629> where

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
off in a minute but it'll show me where

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.440 
off in a minute but it'll show me where
the<00:02:18.170> high<00:02:18.379> spots<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.830> low<00:02:18.980> spots<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.420> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the high spots and low spots are so I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.619 
the high spots and low spots are so I
can<00:02:20.780> keep<00:02:21.769> carving<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.459> it's<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.700> basic<00:02:23.360> kind<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
can keep carving so it's a basic kind of

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.780 
can keep carving so it's a basic kind of
a<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.799> little<00:02:24.980> bits<00:02:25.129> of<00:02:25.190> pine<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.730> I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
a you know a little bits of pine that I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.770 
a you know a little bits of pine that I
made<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:29.030> know<00:02:29.120> practice<00:02:29.599> with

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
made for just you know practice with

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.170 
made for just you know practice with
when<00:02:29.930> I'm<00:02:30.019> working<00:02:30.379> and<00:02:30.739> use<00:02:31.099> as<00:02:31.340> I'm<00:02:31.519> grinding

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
when I'm working and use as I'm grinding

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.979 
when I'm working and use as I'm grinding
so<00:02:33.110> yesterday<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.860> started<00:02:34.220> making<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.819> base<00:02:35.660> out

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
so yesterday I started making a base out

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.130 
so yesterday I started making a base out
of<00:02:36.290> antique<00:02:36.920> mesquite<00:02:37.569> but<00:02:38.569> anyway<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> made

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
of antique mesquite but anyway I made

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.990 
of antique mesquite but anyway I made
this<00:02:39.319> out<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.560> antique<00:02:40.040> mesquite<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:43.000> ebony

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
this out of antique mesquite and ebony

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.289 
this out of antique mesquite and ebony
and<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.810> had<00:02:45.319> made<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.890> put<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> legs<00:02:47.090> on

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
and I had made it and put the legs on

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.170 
and I had made it and put the legs on
and<00:02:47.599> these<00:02:48.200> pieces<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.220> ebony<00:02:49.579> on<00:02:49.760> antique

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
and these pieces of ebony on antique

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.630 
and these pieces of ebony on antique
mesquite<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:51.769> I<00:02:51.799> was<00:02:52.129> gonna<00:02:52.280> drill<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
mesquite and then I was gonna drill a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.009 
mesquite and then I was gonna drill a
hole<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.090> stick<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.480> little<00:02:53.690> light<00:02:53.870> up

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
hole and stick this little light up

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.420 
hole and stick this little light up
through<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.349> with<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> one-inch<00:02:54.860> hole<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.340> then

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
through it with a one-inch hole and then

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.910 
through it with a one-inch hole and then
I<00:02:55.519> kind<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.030> realized<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.900> afterwards<00:02:57.739> that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
I kind of realized that afterwards that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.110 
I kind of realized that afterwards that
I<00:02:57.950> thought<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.370> might<00:02:58.549> be<00:02:58.640> kind<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:58.849> neat<00:02:59.000> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
I thought it might be kind of neat to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.009 
I thought it might be kind of neat to
make<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.450> with<00:02:59.660> an<00:02:59.840> LED<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.629> there<00:03:02.629> was<00:03:02.750> no<00:03:02.900> way

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
make one with an LED so there was no way

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.479 
make one with an LED so there was no way
to<00:03:03.049> get<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:03.560> with<00:03:03.709> my<00:03:03.860> router<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:04.459> I

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
to get in there with my router so I

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.830 
to get in there with my router so I
ended<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.790> having<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.090> route<00:03:05.299> everything<00:03:05.690> out

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
ended up having to route everything out

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.979 
ended up having to route everything out
with<00:03:06.140> my<00:03:06.739> dremel<00:03:07.099> tool<00:03:07.540> again<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.810> right

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
with my dremel tool again with the right

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.420 
with my dremel tool again with the right
bits<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.379> could<00:03:09.530> pretty<00:03:09.650> much<00:03:09.739> do<00:03:09.980> anything

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
bits you could pretty much do anything

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.530 
bits you could pretty much do anything
and<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> routed<00:03:11.540> out<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:14.000> area<00:03:14.299> for<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
and so I routed out the area for the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.870 
and so I routed out the area for the
batteries<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:16.150> ran<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> quarter<00:03:17.750> inch

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
batteries and I ran a quarter inch

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.940 
batteries and I ran a quarter inch
quarter<00:03:19.880> inch<00:03:20.030> brass<00:03:20.840> pipe<00:03:21.230> up<00:03:21.500> through<00:03:21.859> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
quarter inch brass pipe up through the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.390 
quarter inch brass pipe up through the
center<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:22.519> an<00:03:22.609> LED<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.950> went

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
center and put an LED and then I went

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.240 
center and put an LED and then I went
ahead<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:26.980> ran<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.040> switch<00:03:28.459> through<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.980> dirty

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
ahead and ran a switch through the dirty

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250 
ahead and ran a switch through the dirty
here<00:03:31.430> ran<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> switch<00:03:32.030> through<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.660> put<00:03:33.019> a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
here ran a switch through and put a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.470 
here ran a switch through and put a
brass<00:03:33.739> plate<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.760> had<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.000> make<00:03:35.120> out<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.419> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
brass plate that I had to make out of a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.839 
brass plate that I had to make out of a
piece<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.690> brass<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.139> got<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> dnj<00:03:36.889> hobby<00:03:37.099> because

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
piece of brass I got a dnj hobby because

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.449 
piece of brass I got a dnj hobby because
they<00:03:38.000> don't<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:40.099> plates<00:03:40.340> that

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
they don't have the plates that

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.520 
they don't have the plates that
obviously<00:03:40.790> fit<00:03:41.000> for<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.299> made<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.810> anyway

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
obviously fit for what I made so anyway

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.740 
obviously fit for what I made so anyway
when<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.739> run<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:42.980> switch<00:03:43.329> light<00:03:44.329> comes<00:03:44.569> on

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
when you run the switch light comes on

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.140 
when you run the switch light comes on
and<00:03:45.370> actually<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.459> turned<00:03:46.700> out<00:03:46.819> pretty<00:03:46.910> nice

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and actually it turned out pretty nice

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.800 
and actually it turned out pretty nice
when<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.569> put<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.489> when<00:03:49.489> you<00:03:49.609> put<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:50.660> one

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
when you put the when you put the one

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.479 
when you put the when you put the one

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
turn the light off so this video doesn't

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.680

go too long I also made a small piece of
Ebony<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.069> bottom<00:04:01.400> which<00:04:02.180> will<00:04:03.010> go<00:04:04.010> right

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
Ebony for the bottom which will go right

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.240 
Ebony for the bottom which will go right
in<00:04:04.340> there<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:06.109> seal<00:04:06.590> off<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.889> bottom<00:04:07.160> I'll

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
in there and seal off the bottom I'll

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.699 
in there and seal off the bottom I'll
put<00:04:07.370> one<00:04:07.519> little<00:04:07.609> screw<00:04:08.169> so<00:04:09.169> that'll<00:04:09.470> be<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
put one little screw so that'll be the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.970 
put one little screw so that'll be the
base<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.510> for<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.569> nightlight<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.680> I'll<00:04:12.859> go

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
base and for the nightlight and I'll go

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.110 
base and for the nightlight and I'll go
ahead<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.250> show<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.459> with<00:04:13.669> the<00:04:13.760> light<00:04:13.939> off

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
now when you turn that one on

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.710 
now when you turn that one on
and<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.360> put<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.410> birds<00:04:20.720> it's

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and you put the one with the birds it's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.600 
and you put the one with the birds it's
pretty<00:04:22.020> bright<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.620> mean<00:04:22.950> actually<00:04:23.430> it's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
pretty bright I mean actually it's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.910 
pretty bright I mean actually it's
really<00:04:24.120> bright<00:04:24.450> but<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:25.350> can<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:25.650> how<00:04:25.800> it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
really bright but you can see how it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
really bright but you can see how it
gives<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.310> look<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.760> bird<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:29.550> looks<00:04:29.760> much

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
gives the look of the bird it looks much

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.230 
gives the look of the bird it looks much
better<00:04:30.150> obviously<00:04:30.930> without<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:32.240> going

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
better obviously without this going

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.700 
better obviously without this going
through<00:04:33.510> here<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.990> if<00:04:34.080> all<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.380> lights<00:04:34.560> are

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
through here and if all the lights are

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.780 
through here and if all the lights are
off<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.950> have<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.100> light<00:04:35.280> on<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> background

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
off I have a light on in the background

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.220 
off I have a light on in the background
but<00:04:36.180> as<00:04:36.210> you<00:04:36.360> still<00:04:36.660> see<00:04:36.810> how<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.960> birds

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
but as you still see how the birds

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.850 
but as you still see how the birds
outline<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:37.940> light<00:04:39.530> now<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.830> a

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
outline with the light now this is a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.070 
outline with the light now this is a
little<00:04:41.100> thick<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.490> here<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.570> do<00:04:42.720> kind<00:04:42.990> of

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
little thick in here but I do kind of

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.210 
little thick in here but I do kind of
like<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:43.470> don't<00:04:43.530> want<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.740> have<00:04:43.860> everything<00:04:44.070> so

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
like an LED which I kind of like the LED

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.380 
like an LED which I kind of like the LED
better<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.460> could<00:04:50.580> leave<00:04:50.700> comments<00:04:51.180> let<00:04:51.360> me

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
LED here and this one is my the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.040 
LED here and this one is my the
cockatiels

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
cockatiels

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.890 
cockatiels
so<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.140> can<00:05:01.260> see<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> cockatiels<00:05:02.010> here<00:05:02.900> comes

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
so you can see the cockatiels here comes

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:12.040 
so you can see the cockatiels here comes
around<00:05:07.040> there's<00:05:08.040> another<00:05:08.310> one

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.840 

and<00:05:12.560> another

so now if I turn off that other light I

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.590 
so now if I turn off that other light I
bear<00:05:20.550> with<00:05:20.790> me

product this is all done with the Dremel
and<00:05:51.080> mostly<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.710> used<00:05:52.040> probably<00:05:52.700> all<00:05:52.910> five<00:05:53.120> bits

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
and mostly I used probably all five bits

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.580 
and mostly I used probably all five bits

the 105 106 107 and then I used a couple
other<00:05:57.800> boring<00:05:58.640> bits<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:59.570> make<00:06:00.140> it<00:06:00.260> happen<00:06:00.470> okay

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.880 
than red this has got a pack for three
triple<00:06:15.080> A's<00:06:15.230> and<00:06:15.830> I<00:06:16.580> ran<00:06:16.820> a<00:06:16.850> simple<00:06:17.450> switch

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
triple A's and I ran a simple switch

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.580 
triple A's and I ran a simple switch
which<00:06:18.890> is<00:06:19.160> a<00:06:19.190> switch<00:06:19.670> I<00:06:19.820> got<00:06:19.850> RadioShack<00:06:20.750> like

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
which is a switch I got RadioShack like

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.940 
which is a switch I got RadioShack like
that<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:24.020> it's<00:06:24.230> got<00:06:24.380> three<00:06:24.800> on<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.250> back<00:06:25.430> and

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
that and it's got three on the back and

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.680 
that and it's got three on the back and
I<00:06:27.950> had<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.250> make<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.490> plate<00:06:28.730> myself<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.480> brass

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
I had to make the plate myself the brass

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.930 
I had to make the plate myself the brass
plate<00:06:30.100> and<00:06:31.100> then<00:06:31.880> the<00:06:32.120> LED<00:06:32.360> is<00:06:33.110> a<00:06:33.950> very<00:06:34.580> bright

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
plate and then the LED is a very bright

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.160 
plate and then the LED is a very bright
white<00:06:35.840> LED<00:06:36.080> and<00:06:37.030> again<00:06:38.030> once<00:06:38.270> I<00:06:38.450> ran<00:06:38.720> out<00:06:38.900> the

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
white LED and again once I ran out the

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.960 
white LED and again once I ran out the
specs<00:06:39.560> for<00:06:39.860> it<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.040> ended<00:06:40.160> up<00:06:40.310> being<00:06:40.610> I<00:06:40.880> think

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
specs for it it ended up being I think

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.830 
specs for it it ended up being I think
for<00:06:41.450> that<00:06:41.600> one<00:06:41.840> was<00:06:42.050> going<00:06:42.230> to<00:06:42.350> be<00:06:42.470> 56<00:06:43.540> 56<00:06:44.540> ohms

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
for that one was going to be 56 56 ohms

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.950 
for that one was going to be 56 56 ohms
with<00:06:45.170> an<00:06:45.290> 8<00:06:45.500> watt<00:06:46.100> resistor<00:06:46.970> however<00:06:47.720> I<00:06:47.840> ended

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
with an 8 watt resistor however I ended

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.350 
with an 8 watt resistor however I ended
up<00:06:48.200> using<00:06:48.380> a<00:06:48.740> hundred<00:06:49.220> which<00:06:49.460> brought<00:06:50.120> the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
up using a hundred which brought the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.390 
up using a hundred which brought the
light<00:06:51.200> down<00:06:51.410> just<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.740> little<00:06:51.950> bit<00:06:52.070> so<00:06:52.160> it's<00:06:52.280> not

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
light down just a little bit so it's not

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.640 
light down just a little bit so it's not
as<00:06:52.550> bright<00:06:53.110> anyway<00:06:54.110> if<00:06:54.200> you<00:06:54.290> guys<00:06:54.380> have<00:06:54.560> any

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
as bright anyway if you guys have any

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.410 
as bright anyway if you guys have any

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
something that I make as in whether it's

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.690 
something that I make as in whether it's
a<00:06:59.780> speed<00:07:00.020> video<00:07:00.200> or<00:07:00.770> maybe<00:07:01.010> just<00:07:01.190> do<00:07:01.370> a<00:07:01.400> short
