right<00:00:01.410> guys<00:00:01.620> my<00:00:02.190> heater<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:03.179> mean<00:00:03.750> just<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
right guys my heater I mean just to

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.460 
right guys my heater I mean just to
recap<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.970> sort<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.690> small<00:00:07.259> but

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
recap on on this sort of small but

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
recap on on this sort of small but
important<00:00:08.010> job<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.519> know<00:00:08.760> replacing<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
important job you know replacing the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.660 
important job you know replacing the
final<00:00:09.840> stage<00:00:10.019> resistor<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.559> these<00:00:10.740> l32<00:00:11.429> T's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
final stage resistor on these l32 T's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.200 
final stage resistor on these l32 T's
mines<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.690> four<00:00:12.929> point<00:00:13.170> four<00:00:13.440> v8<00:00:13.889> I'm<00:00:14.280> pretty

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
mines of four point four v8 I'm pretty

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
mines of four point four v8 I'm pretty
sure<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.660> mean<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> diesel<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.680> before

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
sure I mean I had a diesel one before

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.849 
sure I mean I had a diesel one before
and<00:00:17.420> it<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> same<00:00:18.990> problem<00:00:19.529> when<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and it had the same problem when the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.769 
and it had the same problem when the
final<00:00:20.220> stage<00:00:20.400> resistor<00:00:20.910> patter<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.449> guess<00:00:21.630> I'm

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
final stage resistor patter I guess I'm

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.000 
final stage resistor patter I guess I'm
not<00:00:21.900> lucky<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.260> these<00:00:22.470> final<00:00:22.830> stage

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
not lucky with these final stage

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.099 
not lucky with these final stage
resistors<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.970> think<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.960> will

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
resistors but I think a lot of you will

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
resistors but I think a lot of you will
have<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> replace<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.550> stage<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
have to replace this some stage or the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.130 
have to replace this some stage or the
other<00:00:27.470> I've<00:00:28.470> started<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> car<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:30.330> fan<00:00:30.750> has

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
other I've started up the car my fan has

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.610 
other I've started up the car my fan has
always<00:00:31.470> been<00:00:31.859> slow<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.510> powerful<00:00:33.809> no

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
always been slow not as powerful no

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.420 
always been slow not as powerful no
hissing<00:00:35.840> basically<00:00:36.840> rubbish<00:00:37.230> I've<00:00:37.770> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
hissing basically rubbish I've just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.639 
hissing basically rubbish I've just
replaced<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> final<00:00:39.390> stage<00:00:39.570> resistor<00:00:40.140> it's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
replaced the final stage resistor it's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
replaced the final stage resistor it's
fitted<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> give<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.360> go

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
fitted in and I'm about to give it a go

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.819 
fitted in and I'm about to give it a go
and<00:00:43.460> let's<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.850> works<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.649> just<00:00:46.649> turn

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and let's see if it works so just turn

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.720 
and let's see if it works so just turn
that<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:48.440> mean<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.890> hear<00:00:50.219> I'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that on I mean as you can hear I'm

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
that on I mean as you can hear I'm
really<00:00:51.120> happy<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> doesn't<00:00:52.199> sound

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
really happy I don't it doesn't sound

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
really happy I don't it doesn't sound
like<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.739> well<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.910> happy<00:00:54.090> because

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
pedals come out I am very simple guys I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.620 
pedals come out I am very simple guys I
mean<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.000> first<00:02:25.210> time<00:02:25.450> I've<00:02:25.600> ever

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
mean this is the first time I've ever

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.600 
mean this is the first time I've ever
changed<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> final<00:02:26.650> stage<00:02:26.830> resistor<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.460> my

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
changed the final stage resistor in my

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.330 
changed the final stage resistor in my
life<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.210> if<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.050> if<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.130> can

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
life so if you if I can do it as you can

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
life so if you if I can do it as you can
see<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.580> plugged<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.030> there<00:02:31.240> that's<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
see it's plugged in there that's the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.180 
see it's plugged in there that's the
same<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.740> that's<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.840> FS<00:02:34.840> our<00:02:35.110> final<00:02:36.010> stage

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
same one that's the FS our final stage

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460 
same one that's the FS our final stage
resist<00:02:36.490> is<00:02:36.640> plugging<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.570> didn't<00:02:38.290> have

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
resist is plugging there I didn't have

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.830 
resist is plugging there I didn't have
it<00:02:38.830> wasn't<00:02:39.190> screwed<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.390> pushed<00:02:40.660> it

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it wasn't screwed in I just pushed it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840 
it wasn't screwed in I just pushed it
back<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.890> important<00:02:42.520> thing<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.760> remember

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
back in the important thing to remember

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.430 
back in the important thing to remember
is<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.680> push<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.100> back<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.730> far<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.060> possible

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
is to push it back in as far as possible

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.780 
is to push it back in as far as possible
because<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.590> pushed<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> first<00:02:48.550> time

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
because I pushed it in the first time

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.070 
because I pushed it in the first time
and<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.030> thought<00:02:49.060> he<00:02:49.300> was<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.690> then<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.930> thought

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
and I thought he was in then I thought

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.260 
and I thought he was in then I thought
I'll<00:02:50.200> give<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.440> another<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.790> push<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.180> in

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I'll give it another go you push it in

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.150 
I'll give it another go you push it in
and<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.510> know<00:02:52.780> when<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.530> important

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
and you know when it's in it's important

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.310 
and you know when it's in it's important
that<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.489> goes<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.970> right<00:02:55.300> into<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.900> motor<00:02:56.080> not

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
that it goes in right into the motor not

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.000 
that it goes in right into the motor not
not<00:02:56.680> obviously<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.810> excessive<00:02:59.410> force<00:02:59.680> use

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
not obviously with excessive force use

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.660 
not obviously with excessive force use
reasonable<00:03:00.489> force<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.150> now<00:03:02.550> opposite<00:03:03.550> of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
reasonable force and now opposite of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.479 
reasonable force and now opposite of
reversal<00:03:04.300> refitting<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.620> was<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.980> last<00:03:06.160> off

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
reversal refitting this was the last off

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.840 
reversal refitting this was the last off
which<00:03:07.360> becomes<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.230> first<00:03:08.590> bit<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.250> we're
