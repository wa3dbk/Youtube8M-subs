them<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.110> make<00:03:25.610> I've<00:03:26.610> no<00:03:26.820> idea<00:03:26.910> how<00:03:27.180> much

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
them and make I've no idea how much

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.010 
them and make I've no idea how much
money<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.540> will<00:03:27.720> make<00:03:27.870> five<00:03:28.140> thousand<00:03:28.650> times

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
money that will make five thousand times

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.890 
money that will make five thousand times
776<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.400> how<00:03:32.520> much<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.910> would<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.209> for

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
776 that is how much you would get for

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.470 
776 that is how much you would get for
that<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.550> one<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:35.940> using<00:03:36.270> this

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that so that is one way of using this

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.270 
that so that is one way of using this
glitch<00:03:36.810> there<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.260> another<00:03:37.530> way<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> using<00:03:38.070> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
glitch there is another way of using it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.870 
glitch there is another way of using it
in<00:03:38.400> terms<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.900> duplicate<00:03:40.440> items<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.340> you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.310 
inventory let's go ahead and have a look
now<00:04:40.830> how<00:04:41.190> many<00:04:41.340> we've<00:04:41.550> got<00:04:41.880> we've<00:04:42.210> got<00:04:42.240> 16<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
now how many we've got we've got 16 you

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080 
now how many we've got we've got 16 you
know<00:04:43.440> infantry<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.190> who<00:04:44.640> knows<00:04:44.790> how<00:04:45.060> many

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
know infantry and who knows how many

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.180 
know infantry and who knows how many
we've<00:04:45.360> got<00:04:45.540> stacked<00:04:45.900> up<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.590> pile<00:04:46.860> there

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
we've got stacked up in that pile there

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.300 
we've got stacked up in that pile there
so<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.450> don't<00:04:49.020> know<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.350> could<00:04:49.530> have<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.950> don't

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
so I don't know we could have I don't

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.950 
so I don't know we could have I don't
know<00:04:50.370> we've<00:04:50.490> got<00:04:50.580> loads<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.750> there<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.930> go

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
know we've got loads so there you go

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.420 
know we've got loads so there you go
that<00:04:52.170> is<00:04:52.200> another<00:04:52.590> way<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.800> using<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.730> glitch

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
that is another way of using this glitch

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
that is another way of using this glitch
something<00:04:56.430> else<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.700> can<00:04:56.850> do<00:04:56.970> as<00:04:57.120> well<00:04:57.270> if

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
something else you can do as well if

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.870 
something else you can do as well if
there's<00:04:57.660> items<00:04:58.080> that<00:04:58.290> are<00:04:58.380> worth<00:04:58.590> LP<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.610> for

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
there's items that are worth LP so for

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.760 
there's items that are worth LP so for
example<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.420> toddler<00:05:01.050> it's<00:05:01.440> quite<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.620> lot<00:05:01.710> of

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
example the toddler it's quite a lot of

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.620 
example the toddler it's quite a lot of
total<00:05:02.100> items<00:05:02.220> these<00:05:02.850> items<00:05:03.060> do<00:05:03.330> have<00:05:03.480> to<00:05:03.570> be

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
total items these items do have to be

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.790 
total items these items do have to be
items<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.170> place<00:05:04.350> outside<00:05:04.560> of

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
items that you can place outside of

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.070 
items that you can place outside of
