 present you and a site that I have 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.710
 discovered with my friends that works 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 very well to be able to create a team 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.350
 make two teams should so for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.869
 start at the beginning before discovering 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.380
 this act I had united creates rather lousy 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 but not very hard we can see that I 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 mens is a very big team of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 barkly among others 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.460
