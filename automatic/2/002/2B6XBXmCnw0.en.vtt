00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.450
 korner moore is the name of the winner in 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:11.070
 championat second qualification to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.570
 big price and to that or 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.179
 daniel deuÃŸer germany first 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 Congratulations 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.929
 I think that was one today 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.849
 relatively heavy task here completely after 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.789
 very many starters are riding very front 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.650
 many 0 a long sting yes that was 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.779
 we leave at the course 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.089
 it may not be that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 all difficult parcours is the time 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.850
 was however very short set 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.160
 it started after the first one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 starter equal a bit increased in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 after all, you have to say that was 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.739
 maybe decisive why 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 would end up having 17 0 by that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.020
 Of course we have a lot of good couples in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 I have to sting a little something 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 risking me very much though 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 has succeeded well and luckily it has 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 just about a how straight 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 also with the katharina for her 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 So the starter field in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 This exam was already very strong 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.460
 that will not be tomorrow in the big price 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.019
 be different 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.929
 what characterizes this tournament in vienna 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.430
 out of sight 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.850
 okay here in vienna we have a great 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 hall over years and that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 tournament has tradition as well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.130
 I do not know how many years now 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.420
 it had always been that way before 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.369
 was a bit small 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 Nevertheless, it still remains 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.880
 Traditional tournament has always been very good 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 starter field by itself now of course 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.780
 another new ridescale here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 Of course, there is still time 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.009
 better rey so synonymous her best 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 horses here to fifth star plays 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.439
 no role at all 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.439
 Definitely in any case the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.820
 tender is very very good we 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.979
 have a five-star tournament with 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 considerably more prize money than in the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.070
 years ago 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.299
 which is also crucial but the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.579
 Of course, conditions are also very good 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.500
 this year and we have a whole here 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.540
 large group and german riders the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.950
 now a topic for the broad 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.130
 not the big one 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 well-known have at least in Austria 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.020
 of course you know them in 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.000
 Germany, of course, knows her 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.829
 as well and they are very good 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 successful so belong here around 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.159
 other times the German anthem is like that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.630
 a bit of an attack on the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.020
 Swiss dominance among the Viennese 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.020
 joust 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.860
 I have to say we have good German 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.840
 I would not attack here 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.480
 say directly but everyone tries 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 of course his best here in the course 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.770
 and there she has a very good one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.720
 had tournament here, of course, too 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.850
 Horses have been doing very well all year long 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.840
 jumped 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.100
 I had won a jump now 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.800
 I did not like that with a horse 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.540
 but I have a few already 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.950
 jumping has won so in the end it is 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.810
 but good horses again the front 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.450
 Then we'll talk again 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.580
 very briefly on account what is that for a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.960
 horse the ancestry is with the name 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.540
 clearly market leader talked about 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.070
 minister father like you i im 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.310
 training what kind of a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.600
 horse just said he is so easy 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.920
 is only nine years old maybe has 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.420
 not the very last experience 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.250
 but he has a super great attitude 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 Great technology and that makes him 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.850
 of course, life is a course 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.130
 bit easier you have it then 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.660
 still still riding that is then 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.790
 the top of it are in the case of daniel 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.080
 But how are you doing well ? 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.130
 you can see the big price 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.959
 Of course, all of a sudden, now, too 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.360
 win again very differently as well 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.459
 if we could the handball as a winner 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.820
 in the championship you have what you have 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.739
 just won ok tomorrow 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.980
 again a new day new game new 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.100
 Good luck in the end as I said we have good 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 career very good horses here 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.400
 I want to say that there are certainly 15 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.690
 20 people favorite tomorrow night but completely 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.430
 Frankly my horse jump too 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.750
 very good and if I should ride well 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.850
 I also have a chance 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.989
 It's self-esteem is on everyone 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.080
 if it works then maybe it still works 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.660
 very briefly to the wimberger the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 legendary write up artist in vienna 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.510
 how is tournament then moderately in this 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.910
 year maybe even further, however 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.480
 still some big tournaments in the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.459
 tournament calendar the calendar is full 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.750
 for me it is so next 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.590
 week in stuttgart will continue 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.450
 and then I have two weeks first 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.170
 smaller tournaments with younger horses 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.069
 and then in december 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.540
 Let's see how stuttgart runs 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.980
 maybe there is still a chance 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.549
 London and Mechelen are still to go 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.139
 two world cup tournament laconia also still 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.850
 a very good tournament frankfurt 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.049
 still in december so my plan for 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.750
 december is not one hundred percent 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.220
 fixed when you feel so different 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.110
 and I asked her again and again 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.540
 riders the space here 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.070
 it is actually still like her 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.490
 hometown on a sunday morning 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.270
 In any case, far as far as I am concerned 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.600
 sometimes I also see myself after that 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.220
 but good that is our life and mine 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.100
 It's fun and there I am 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.330
 determined and of course the successes 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.040
 tuning in to make it even more fun 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.260
 let's see if it will be tomorrow again 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.180
 fun just when we get back here 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.060
 all good things are in the thumb 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.750
 thank you for coming from germany 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 Many Thanks
