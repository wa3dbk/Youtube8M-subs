 [Music] 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello youtube friends good many of 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.219
 you try to install 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.619
 applications or install new roms 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.500
 from the kernel field as you see here 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.410
 up on the samsung galaxy s2 and it gives you 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.030
 error when installing good gives you 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.740
 error because this kernel has many 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.199
 problems when flashing files 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.730
 zip then we have two solutions or the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.820
 that he raised in a previous video in the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.250
 that we saw how you could flash the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.680
 kernel yes to the class we go through 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.910
 of audouin and then restart in the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 chair recovery 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.350
 another alternative option would be 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.469
 directly from here flash a 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.660
 new recovery and from there execute the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.070
 installation of that new rom or that new 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.370
 program that we want good let's see 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.969
 how would it be done 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.070
 we would give it to install later from the 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.100
 sd card where we have it hosted in 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.440
 this case 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.829
 we are going to look for the file in 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.829
 question 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 to see if I remember where I have it 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.980
 here it is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.190
 it's called cwm cip 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.920
 we execute it 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.810
 or rather we installed it and we are already 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.730
 within a new recovery recovery that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820
 it will not give us the problems that we 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.230
 before the kernel field ok and already 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.180
 from here we can do all 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.850
 those functions that did not let us do 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.230
 the old card for example 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.230
 white cache partition 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.240
 confirm 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.140
 wave datafactory reset 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.140
 confirm 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.049
 within advanced biscuit wipe 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 and now we go back 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 and we can install that new rom that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.160
 we want to install 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.470
 let's put one for example that I 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.470
 I have saved here 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.700
 to see if I find it 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.700
 I'm already installing this new rom that 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.860
 before he had not let me install because 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.900
 the kernel field has a recovery that 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 I repeat it gives enough problems so 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.250
 this video is complementary to the one 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.860
 we saw in his day how to install a rom 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.720
 from the kernel field the card fit is 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.680
 what we have when when we have a 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.230
 version 412 for samsung galaxy s2 or 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.480
 based on that version the last lic of 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.800
 samsung if we have it rooted 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.510
 obviously if we do not have it rooted 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.070
 we have the card the original and with that 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.700
 then we can not flash either because 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.530
 does not lead to advanced recovery 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.450
 but now we have the new card 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.060
 of the xi since it is compatible with these 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.560
 versions of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.640
 android well, here I leave this 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.010
 alternative to not have to walk 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.340
 by placing this file I leave you also 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.630
 the link to download this file 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.980
 flash and talk from recovery so that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.510
 you can do it directly from there 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.050
 good is a greeting to all and even the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.050
 next video
