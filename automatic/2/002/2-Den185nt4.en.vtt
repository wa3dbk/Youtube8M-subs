00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
fire in the desert I guess that makes

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.290 
fire in the desert I guess that makes
sense<00:03:38.420> because<00:03:38.840> hot<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.790> flammable

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
sense because hot but it's and flammable

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.260 
sense because hot but it's and flammable
no<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.020> not<00:03:42.230> no<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.590> put<00:03:42.950> sand<00:03:43.370> on<00:03:43.640> fire<00:03:44.000> to

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
no it's not no you put sand on fire to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.850 
no it's not no you put sand on fire to
put<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.510> out

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.250 

I<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.210> I'm<00:03:48.360> as<00:03:48.480> funny<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:48.990> think<00:03:49.170> I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
I don't think I'm as funny as I think I

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.450 
I don't think I'm as funny as I think I
am<00:03:50.390> Australia<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.450> weird<00:03:51.690> right<00:03:52.050> now<00:03:52.800> I

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
am Australia is weird right now I

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.250 
am Australia is weird right now I
understand<00:03:54.060> why<00:03:54.150> people<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:57.720> such<00:03:57.990> funny

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
understand why people have such funny

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.140 
understand why people have such funny
videos<00:03:58.710> I<00:03:58.950> guess<00:03:59.160> because<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.790> just<00:03:59.940> start

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
videos I guess because you just start

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.780 
videos I guess because you just start
losing<00:04:00.510> your<00:04:00.630> mind<00:04:00.840> talking<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.500> yourself

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
losing your mind talking to yourself

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.610 
losing your mind talking to yourself
that's<00:04:02.790> inherently<00:04:03.480> funny<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:04.590> watch

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
that's inherently funny to watch

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.040 
that's inherently funny to watch
somebody<00:04:06.110> go<00:04:07.110> insane
