 this year's edition coming out on consoles 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.670

 many questions to the head not about 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.050
 everything that is going to be of the quality of those 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.489
 focused on another sector that quality is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.660
 can give that product not sometimes 16 to 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.519
 17 of 2017 according to copy and paste or a 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.540

 may be one of the rates of the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.099
 reasons I think the big reason 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.659

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.689
