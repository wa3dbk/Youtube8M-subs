00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
15 almost 20 years probably so these are

15 almost 20 years probably so these are
the<00:00:31.800> kids<00:00:32.040> who<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.660> technically<00:00:33.660> getting

the kids who are technically getting

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
the kids who are technically getting
pretty<00:00:34.739> good<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.190> mean<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> almost<00:00:36.210> teach

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pretty good I mean they can almost teach

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
pretty good I mean they can almost teach
themselves<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> way<00:00:37.800> they've<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.250> gotten

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
themselves in a way they've just gotten

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
themselves in a way they've just gotten
to<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> point<00:00:38.760> where<00:00:38.960> they've<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to the point where they've got the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
to the point where they've got the
basics<00:00:41.280> down<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.820> they're<00:00:41.910> starting<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
basics down and they're starting to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
basics down and they're starting to
really<00:00:42.510> progress<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.170> learn<00:00:43.320> new<00:00:43.559> tricks

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
really progress and learn new tricks

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.880 
really progress and learn new tricks
almost<00:00:44.219> every<00:00:44.430> day<00:00:44.579> well<00:00:45.539> there's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> box<00:00:46.559> over

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
almost every day well there's a box over

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
almost every day well there's a box over
here<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:48.300> they've<00:00:48.480> started<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
here that's because they've started to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.270 
here that's because they've started to
learn<00:00:49.020> how<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.289> ollie<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> bring<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
learn how to ollie which is to bring the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.709 
learn how to ollie which is to bring the
board<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> air<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> jump<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
board up in the air and jump with it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
board up in the air and jump with it
then<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:53.190> trying<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> teach<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> trick

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then we're trying to teach them a trick

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
then we're trying to teach them a trick
where<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.570> Ollie<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.289> land<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
where you can Ollie and then land on the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.880 
where you can Ollie and then land on the
ledge<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> slide<00:00:56.850> along<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> ledge<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.320> they

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
ledge and slide along the ledge so they

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
ledge and slide along the ledge so they
get<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> few<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
get a few of them can get up to the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.990 
get a few of them can get up to the
ledge<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> stop<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> try

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
ledge and stop on it and we want to try

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
ledge and stop on it and we want to try
and<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> slide

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and see if they can get on and slide

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.179 
and see if they can get on and slide
along<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:09.020> lot<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> time<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
along a lot of the time they get on a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.310 
along a lot of the time they get on a
skateboard<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:12.780> there<00:01:13.170> almost

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
skateboard and it's all there almost

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.450 
skateboard and it's all there almost
inventing<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.310> watch

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
inventing it again because you watch

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
inventing it again because you watch
them<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.290> funny<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> see

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
them do things and it's funny to see

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.899 
them do things and it's funny to see
because<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.979> haven't<00:01:17.159> told<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> do

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
because we haven't told them what to do

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.800 
because we haven't told them what to do
and<00:01:17.939> they've<00:01:18.119> never<00:01:18.210> seen<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> before<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and they've never seen it before and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.530 
and they've never seen it before and
they<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.290> doing<00:01:19.530> things<00:01:19.850> naturally<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
they start doing things naturally that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
they start doing things naturally that
skateboarders<00:01:22.110> probably<00:01:22.409> did<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.860> they

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
skateboarders probably did when they

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
skateboarders probably did when they
first<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.549> runs<00:01:23.610> capable<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.150> well<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
first two runs capable as well like

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.810 
first two runs capable as well like
whatever<00:01:24.960> 30<00:01:25.409> 40<00:01:25.710> years<00:01:25.770> ago<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.610> pretty

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
whatever 30 40 years ago so it's pretty

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
whatever 30 40 years ago so it's pretty
funny<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> watch

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.250 

it's<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.090> source<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.450> happiness<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:35.110> it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
it's just a source of happiness like it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.050 
it's just a source of happiness like it
I<00:01:35.530> mean<00:01:36.010> they've<00:01:36.220> come<00:01:36.490> from<00:01:36.670> very<00:01:36.850> harsh

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
I mean they've come from very harsh

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.550 
I mean they've come from very harsh
backgrounds<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.690> lot<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.900> them<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.290> probably

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
backgrounds a lot of them and probably

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.890 
backgrounds a lot of them and probably
have<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:39.100> lot<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.550> trauma<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:40.180> lot<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.780> know

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
when they come skateboarding but usually
