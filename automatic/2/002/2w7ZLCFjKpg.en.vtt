and let us get back to this powerful
lightweight<00:02:37.590> 1/5<00:02:38.590> scale<00:02:39.010> red<00:02:39.940> can't<00:02:40.239> be

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
lightweight 1/5 scale red can't be

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.729 
lightweight 1/5 scale red can't be
sitting<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:42.510> alright<00:02:43.510> once<00:02:43.870> again<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.500> can

sitting here alright once again you can

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.660 
sitting here alright once again you can
see<00:02:44.770> we<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:46.350> metal-bodied<00:02:47.350> shocks<00:02:48.040> fully

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
see we have metal-bodied shocks fully

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.800 
see we have metal-bodied shocks fully
adjustable<00:02:50.220> thicker<00:02:51.220> dog<00:02:51.550> bones<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.209> this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
adjustable thicker dog bones and this

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.780 
adjustable thicker dog bones and this
plastic<00:02:53.380> material<00:02:53.410> has<00:02:54.010> been<00:02:54.220> strengthened

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
plastic material has been strengthened

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.449 
plastic material has been strengthened
out<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.330> much<00:02:55.870> more<00:02:56.110> stronger<00:02:56.620> than<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.220> used

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
out it's much more stronger than it used

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
out it's much more stronger than it used
to<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.700> on<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.570> first<00:02:58.780> prototype<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.620> here

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
to be on the first prototype and here

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.300 
to be on the first prototype and here
you<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.760> see<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.450> hex<00:03:01.810> wheel<00:03:02.650> hexes<00:03:03.130> have

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
you can see the hex wheel hexes have

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.520 
you can see the hex wheel hexes have
been<00:03:03.459> removed<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.150> they<00:03:04.480> have<00:03:04.690> been<00:03:05.230> replaced

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
been removed and they have been replaced

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.949 
been removed and they have been replaced
with<00:03:05.830> these<00:03:06.130> new<00:03:06.400> pieces<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:07.330> I'm<00:03:07.450> just

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
with these new pieces here I'm just

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.820 
with these new pieces here I'm just
loving<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> setup<00:03:08.980> now<00:03:09.390> all<00:03:10.390> right<00:03:10.600> let's<00:03:11.560> get

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
loving the setup now all right let's get

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.580 
loving the setup now all right let's get
to<00:03:12.430> look<00:03:12.670> inside<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.930> back<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
to look inside from the back of the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.560 
to look inside from the back of the
shell<00:03:14.830> at<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> moment<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.850> see<00:03:15.880> there<00:03:16.450> is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
shell at the moment you can see there is

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.680 
shell at the moment you can see there is
a<00:03:16.600> standard<00:03:17.230> exhaust<00:03:17.709> there<00:03:18.130> at<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> moment

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
a standard exhaust there at the moment

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.370 
a standard exhaust there at the moment
I'm<00:03:19.690> gonna<00:03:20.080> put<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.920> tune<00:03:21.190> one<00:03:21.489> very<00:03:21.820> soon

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I'm gonna put on the tune one very soon

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.690 
I'm gonna put on the tune one very soon
probably<00:03:23.380> breaking<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.220> engine<00:03:24.519> with<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
probably breaking the engine with the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.720 
probably breaking the engine with the
tuned<00:03:25.000> exhaust<00:03:25.209> as<00:03:25.630> well<00:03:26.160> okay<00:03:27.160> from<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.519> top

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
tuned exhaust as well okay from the top

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.340 
tuned exhaust as well okay from the top
look<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.330> see<00:03:28.540> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.930> your<00:03:29.050> battery

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
look you can see this is your battery

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.070 
look you can see this is your battery
compartment<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.610> battery<00:03:31.060> for<00:03:31.450> powering<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
compartment the battery for powering the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.300 
compartment the battery for powering the
receiver<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
throttle and brake servo okay and under

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.190 
throttle and brake servo okay and under
here<00:03:41.140> sits<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.800> big<00:03:42.640> steering<00:03:43.239> servo<00:03:43.720> it's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
here sits a big steering servo it's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.460 
here sits a big steering servo it's
powerful<00:03:44.739> enough<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.340> steer<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:46.090> beast<00:03:46.470> okay

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
powerful enough to steer this beast okay

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.059 
powerful enough to steer this beast okay
coming<00:03:48.160> here<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:49.349> modified<00:03:50.349> piece<00:03:50.709> it's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
transparent one on a previous prototype

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.850 
transparent one on a previous prototype
but<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> like<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> black<00:03:56.920> one<00:03:56.950> here<00:03:57.519> it's<00:03:58.390> how's
