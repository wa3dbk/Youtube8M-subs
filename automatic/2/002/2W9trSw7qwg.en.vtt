by<00:01:05.210> my<00:01:05.390> port<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.130> wasn't<00:01:07.490> sure<00:01:07.730> what<00:01:07.880> that

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
by my port and I wasn't sure what that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.150 
by my port and I wasn't sure what that
wasn't<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.600> was<00:01:08.690> awful<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.140> felt<00:01:09.350> like<00:01:09.500> just

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
because the pain wasn't really getting

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.910

after<00:01:23.930> looking<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:24.500> everything<00:01:24.770> he<00:01:25.610> said<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
after looking at everything he said the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.590 
after looking at everything he said the
port<00:01:26.270> was<00:01:26.420> fine<00:01:26.690> like<00:01:27.760> but<00:01:28.760> what<00:01:28.910> he<00:01:29.090> sees<00:01:29.360> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
port was fine like but what he sees is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.310 
port was fine like but what he sees is
that<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:30.370> tore<00:01:31.370> some<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.910> fascia<00:01:32.320> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
that I tore some of the fascia and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.090 
that I tore some of the fascia and
between<00:01:33.680> my<00:01:33.890> muscles<00:01:34.280> where<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.610> port<00:01:34.910> is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
between my muscles where the port is

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.840 
between my muscles where the port is
from<00:01:37.100> my<00:01:37.729> violet<00:01:38.180> coughing<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.759> was

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
from my violet coughing and it was

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.240 
from my violet coughing and it was
really<00:01:41.180> painful<00:01:42.250> um<00:01:43.250> so

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.370 

so<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.940> doctor<00:01:47.270> says<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.480> I<00:01:47.720> tore<00:01:48.170> some

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so the doctor says that I tore some

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.450 
so the doctor says that I tore some
Pasha<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:48.800> it's<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:50.780> feels<00:01:51.230> just<00:01:51.680> like<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.220> had

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
Pasha and it's it feels just like I had

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.200 
Pasha and it's it feels just like I had
the<00:01:52.850> port<00:01:53.660> put<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:55.580> still<00:01:56.000> very

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the port put in like it's still very

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.550 
the port put in like it's still very
sensitive<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.200> keep<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:58.730> I<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.840> bend<00:02:00.080> over

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
sensitive and I keep it I can bend over

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.360 
sensitive and I keep it I can bend over
but<00:02:00.800> it's<00:02:00.980> kind<00:02:01.190> of<00:02:01.370> really<00:02:01.700> uncomfortable

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
but it's kind of really uncomfortable

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.840 
but it's kind of really uncomfortable
um<00:02:04.370> so<00:02:05.680> recommendations<00:02:06.680> don't<00:02:06.920> do<00:02:07.130> any<00:02:07.310> heavy

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
um so recommendations don't do any heavy

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.190 
um so recommendations don't do any heavy
lifting<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.440> next<00:02:09.679> couple<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.040> days<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
lifting for the next couple of days and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.320 
lifting for the next couple of days and
tried<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.230> take<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.500> easy<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:14.210> know

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
tried to take it easy and you know

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.820 
tried to take it easy and you know
people<00:02:14.720> at<00:02:14.780> work<00:02:14.900> they've<00:02:15.200> been<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.800> know

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
people at work they've been you know

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.680 
people at work they've been you know
kind<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.280> respecting<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.390> haven't

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
kind of respecting that and I haven't

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.650 
kind of respecting that and I haven't
really<00:02:17.930> been<00:02:17.960> lifting<00:02:18.410> anything<00:02:19.660> that's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
really been lifting anything that's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.670
