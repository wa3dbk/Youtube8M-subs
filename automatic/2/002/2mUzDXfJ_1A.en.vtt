00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
I guess that sort of instilled a bit of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.030 
I guess that sort of instilled a bit of
that<00:00:46.080> emotion<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:47.170> passion<00:00:47.379> for<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:47.830> race

my<00:02:58.300> first<00:02:58.510> bathurst<00:02:59.110> memory<00:02:59.500> was<00:02:59.739> in<00:03:00.160> 1995<00:03:01.060> I

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
my first bathurst memory was in 1995 I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.520 
my first bathurst memory was in 1995 I
was<00:03:01.480> actually<00:03:01.630> up<00:03:01.870> there<00:03:02.020> with<00:03:02.110> my<00:03:02.200> uncle

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
was actually up there with my uncle

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530 
was actually up there with my uncle
camping<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.070> top<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.459> mountain<00:03:03.790> being

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
camping at the top of the mountain being

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410 
camping at the top of the mountain being
a<00:03:04.630> massive<00:03:04.989> Rocky<00:03:05.290> fan<00:03:05.620> when<00:03:06.280> both<00:03:06.610> HRT<00:03:07.150> cars

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
a massive Rocky fan when both HRT cars

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.880 
a massive Rocky fan when both HRT cars
were<00:03:07.600> out<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.870> starter<00:03:08.230> race<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.680> pretty

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
were out of the starter race so I pretty

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.890 
were out of the starter race so I pretty
much<00:03:08.980> want<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.340> pack<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.790> go<00:03:09.910> home<00:03:10.150> but

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
much want to pack up and go home but

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.810 
much want to pack up and go home but
turned<00:03:11.410> out<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.799> very<00:03:12.040> fascinating<00:03:12.310> race

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
turned out to be a very fascinating race

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.400 
turned out to be a very fascinating race
with<00:03:13.090> Larry<00:03:13.330> coming<00:03:13.630> through<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.989> taking<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
with Larry coming through and taking the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.110 
with Larry coming through and taking the
win<00:03:14.590> which<00:03:14.830> was<00:03:15.040> probably<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.850> little<00:03:15.940> bit

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
win which was probably a little bit

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.550 
win which was probably a little bit
unexpected<00:03:16.239> from<00:03:16.840> what<00:03:17.019> happened<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.350> star

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
unexpected from what happened to star

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.760 
unexpected from what happened to star
the<00:03:17.590> race<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.160> very<00:03:18.970> exciting<00:03:19.390> race<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.750> watch

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.730 

a<00:03:26.720> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:27.990> long<00:03:28.170> ago<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.680> probably

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
a little bit too long ago it's probably

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.430 
a little bit too long ago it's probably
early<00:03:29.250> 80s<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.360> was<00:03:30.750> starting<00:03:31.110> my<00:03:31.140> career

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
would be probably 1980 when when my dad

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.439 
would be probably 1980 when when my dad
hit<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.260> rock<00:05:37.440> in<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.740> true-blue<00:05:38.610> 17

he was leading the race I wasn't there

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.450 
he was leading the race I wasn't there
at<00:05:41.999> that<00:05:42.090> stage<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:43.259> I<00:05:43.349> was<00:05:43.499> seven<00:05:44.159> years<00:05:44.189> old

especially the look on marks guy's face
when<00:07:39.740> Jimmy<00:07:40.740> let<00:07:40.949> that<00:07:41.129> one<00:07:41.279> out<00:07:41.520> mark<00:07:42.089> was

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 
when Jimmy let that one out mark was

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.600
