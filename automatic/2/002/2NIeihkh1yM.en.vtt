00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello everyone greets youtube I 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.320
 please 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.280
 video because 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 subject the commet 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.780
 r acts 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 click so I try to make a video a 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.850
 little detail why it's why 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 when to use etc and so blow bah 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.770
 we left immediately in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.770
 custom part 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.910
 so we started from a small game so 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.440
 we're going to watch already tackle explains 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 how does it work at the level of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.330
 shortcuts so I find everything 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 simply in player moves 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.840
 and the tooth movement attac players so 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.300
 that's good ah actually it's not it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 really may but that's because in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.350
 done you can see and he follows a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.269
 actually converted to the game so that's 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.559
 there so for you c and ku and where x so 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.059
 I obviously use the key by 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.379
 ku defect which is still a lot 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.760
 closer to the others 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 other sources shovel like with erdf 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.800
 addresses these loans is this the same for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.450
 stop 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.140
 so I actually keep all in the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 same area so suddenly so for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.110
 attacking already explains it needs to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 understand how it works when 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 I'm leaning on ku so here it puts me 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.870
 actually make of my hero everything 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 simply and as we can see the 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.259
 eve 10 years old kathleen hanna a big 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.079
 big shot rush it's a big area 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.570
 and attacks so explains the convent 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.950
 avoid me miss click and get to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 foot of the two opponents no matter where 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.680
 I click on the ranch or even out of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.100
 ranch for example here know how to attack the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 first target who in front of me that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.350
 it's a black all thoroughly to say to himself 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.700
 that I am a hero 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.590
 it's going to attack the first tag is in 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 face of me so suddenly it smells the 8th 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 a lot to explain myself in the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.630
 teamfights for example because we have 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.280
 declared me I absolutely want to keep 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.020
 my distances with the fight guard 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.429
 absolutely my old age and in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.649
 situations of 1 will see for example also 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.289
 so admits for example the guy I click 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.409
 and I arrive and explain myself 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.429
 admit and I arrive you suddenly 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 here I am going to be throws free self 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.109
 attack 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.280
 and I go everywhere my rank I want 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.499
 to spend a lot of time getting out 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.610
 of all this on the contrary if I keep to 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.240
 every time but tidy I play everything 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.319
 time like that on the move is going to me 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.020
 allow each time to keep it the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.240
 maximum to give back to the church 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.310
 just so that's it's very 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.290
 helpful in teamfights is very helpful 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.850
 in 1 v1 against emails and even 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.730
 against the rangers for example kill 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.630
 you have kathleen and against a vain ben 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.300
 here you can keep bluefin tuna in 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.550
 but the only defect 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.930
 this technique the ctu can be kunter 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.549
 quite easily actually when you see 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.409
 if the guy for example sees you doing 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.120
 a lot of attac + click assured that you 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.090
 moved you to put a ward in 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.010
 done between you and him is suddenly in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.219
 do you go auto attack the award and no 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.109
 him so there I aim them and you saw 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.849
 the first target so I clicked 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.040
 on him so the audoists attack the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.900
 second shot I made attacks 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.430
 public so suddenly but here and the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.629
 suddenly it is you you got clouds so we 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.829
 can we also check it with the 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.689
 ping ward so here I am here I am adopting 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.790
 not at all real so aims the hole in the 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.109
 sea ​​I attack the award first and then 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.569
 it was closest to me though 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.560
 if I go here it's him and I attack 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.840
 and when he's going to distance himself by 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.609
 example see the faf luciana to the world 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.829
 that's just to reach 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.939
 all disputes and it will help you they 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.719
 were not used it asks 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.310
 a lot of training 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.230
 that's why I do it a lot 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.459
 on the lay line safe that looks at my 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.799
 showing off those who are used videos 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.120
 they are common it is precisely for 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.980
 able to show in teamfight and have 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.629
 this this automatism to do it in 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.669
 permanence and suddenly reduce a 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.739
 maximum but demichelis error 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.739
 see you soon and good luck
