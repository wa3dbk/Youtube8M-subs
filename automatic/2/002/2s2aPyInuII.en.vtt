very<00:01:50.840> his<00:01:51.840> end<00:01:52.020> game<00:01:52.049> stats<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.619> very

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
very his end game stats are very

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.679 
very his end game stats are very
underrated<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> game<00:01:54.509> he

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
underrated for what he can do in game he

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
underrated for what he can do in game he
has<00:01:54.780> very<00:01:55.020> good<00:01:55.229> passing<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.610> other<00:01:56.820> than

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
has very good passing but other than

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
has very good passing but other than
that<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.570> only<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> positives<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that that's really only as positives I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490 
that that's really only as positives I
wish<00:01:58.860> he<00:01:59.009> had<00:01:59.479> better<00:02:00.479> finishing<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:01.350> does

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
wish he had better finishing but he does

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
wish he had better finishing but he does
have<00:02:01.649> decent<00:02:02.070> enough<00:02:02.250> finishing<00:02:02.820> heat<00:02:03.200> he's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
have decent enough finishing heat he's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.440 
have decent enough finishing heat he's
just<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.399> his<00:02:05.729> other<00:02:05.820> sets<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.240> very

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
just other all his other sets are very

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
just other all his other sets are very
average<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.200> he<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.920> showed<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.280> in

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
average and he kind of showed that in

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
average and he kind of showed that in
game<00:02:08.520> he's<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.239> average<00:02:09.450> came<00:02:09.810> other<00:02:10.020> than

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
game he's pretty average came other than

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
game he's pretty average came other than
those<00:02:10.379> positives<00:02:10.950> his<00:02:11.340> negative<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
those positives his negative is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640 
those positives his negative is
basically<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.080> his

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
basically that his

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
basically that his
does<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> four-star<00:02:14.430> weak<00:02:14.610> foot<00:02:14.849> but<00:02:15.120> his

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
does have a four-star weak foot but his

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.440 
does have a four-star weak foot but his
left<00:02:16.260> foot<00:02:16.439> just<00:02:16.680> felt<00:02:16.890> pretty<00:02:17.819> terrible<00:02:18.329> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
left foot just felt pretty terrible it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.660 
left foot just felt pretty terrible it
just<00:02:18.659> didn't<00:02:19.620> feel<00:02:19.739> right<00:02:19.829> it's<00:02:20.250> something

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
just didn't feel right it's something

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.059 
just didn't feel right it's something
sometimes<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.810> took<00:02:22.230> some<00:02:22.530> shots<00:02:22.739> with<00:02:22.890> his

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
sometimes it I took some shots with his

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.179 
sometimes it I took some shots with his
left<00:02:23.340> foot<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:24.000> went<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.840> wide

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
left foot and they just went really wide

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.460 
left foot and they just went really wide
didn't<00:02:26.189> really<00:02:26.579> do<00:02:27.540> anything<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.049> help<00:02:28.230> me<00:02:28.439> out

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
didn't really do anything to help me out

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.099 
didn't really do anything to help me out
so<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.849> pretty<00:02:30.180> annoying<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.840> didn't

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
so that was pretty annoying I didn't

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.080 
so that was pretty annoying I didn't
really<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.439> his<00:02:31.650> left<00:02:31.950> foot<00:02:32.189> that's<00:02:32.939> about

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
really like his left foot that's about

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.059 
really like his left foot that's about
it<00:02:33.150> that's<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.810> really<00:02:34.109> negative<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
it that's only is really negative that a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.849 
it that's only is really negative that a
half<00:02:35.310> arm<00:02:35.609> he<00:02:36.000> felt<00:02:36.329> pretty<00:02:37.260> good<00:02:37.439> like<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> said

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
half arm he felt pretty good like I said

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.500 
half arm he felt pretty good like I said
you<00:02:37.920> felt<00:02:38.099> pretty<00:02:38.280> average<00:02:38.519> other<00:02:39.090> than<00:02:39.359> his

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
you felt pretty average other than his

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.420 
you felt pretty average other than his
ball<00:02:39.720> control<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.140> shooting<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:40.980> he<00:02:41.280> did

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
ball control and shooting and he did

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.190 
ball control and shooting and he did
have<00:02:41.579> very<00:02:42.000> underrated<00:02:42.599> passing<00:02:43.019> which

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
have very underrated passing which

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.979 
have very underrated passing which
surprised<00:02:44.159> me<00:02:44.400> since<00:02:44.549> he<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:44.989> position

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
surprised me since he was a position

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.680 
surprised me since he was a position
change<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.859> striker<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.579> camp<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.510> going

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
change from a striker to a camp so going

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.479 
change from a striker to a camp so going
back<00:02:48.780> over<00:02:48.959> his<00:02:49.139> positives<00:02:49.680> he<00:02:49.889> does<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
back over his positives he does have the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.250 
back over his positives he does have the
80<00:02:51.150> ball<00:02:51.480> control<00:02:51.930> 82<00:02:52.489> agility<00:02:53.489> 92<00:02:54.450> shot<00:02:54.959> power

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
at 81 long shots he does have the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.460 
at 81 long shots he does have the
underrated<00:02:59.099> passing<00:02:59.549> like<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.760> said<00:02:59.970> 55<00:03:00.540> long

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
underrated passing like I said 55 long

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
passing and 77 short passing just felt a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.479 
passing and 77 short passing just felt a
lot<00:03:04.170> better<00:03:04.349> than<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.069> game<00:03:05.250> stats

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
lot better than what is in game stats

lot better than what is in game stats
show<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.510> he<00:03:06.629> does<00:03:06.780> have<00:03:06.900> good<00:03:07.109> passing<00:03:07.560> which

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
