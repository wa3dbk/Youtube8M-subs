00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
was gonna go for the toxic huh I would

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630 
was gonna go for the toxic huh I would
rather<00:01:15.299> melodic<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> burned<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.070> toxic

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
rather melodic be burned and toxic

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
rather melodic be burned and toxic
because<00:01:17.790> burn<00:01:18.180> damage<00:01:18.390> doesn't<00:01:18.689> rack<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because burn damage doesn't rack up and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890 
because burn damage doesn't rack up and
she<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> physical<00:01:21.360> attacker<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
she is not a physical attacker so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.179 
she is not a physical attacker so
there's<00:01:22.080> no<00:01:22.200> problems<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.740> being<00:01:22.950> burned

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
there's no problems there being burned

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
there's no problems there being burned
having<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> physical<00:01:24.030> attack<00:01:24.390> cut<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.720> half<00:01:25.009> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
having a physical attack cut in half so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
having a physical attack cut in half so
here<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.729> figuring<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.240> he's<00:01:27.420> gonna<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.840> for

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
here I'm figuring that he's gonna go for

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.050 
here I'm figuring that he's gonna go for
another<00:01:28.170> attacking<00:01:28.950> move<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
another attacking move so I was like you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
another attacking move so I was like you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
know what this is a good chance for me

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.140 
know what this is a good chance for me
to<00:01:31.350> try<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.590> set<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.040> him<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
to try and set up on him I'm going to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.539 
to try and set up on him I'm going to
switch<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.079> azumarill<00:01:34.680> because

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
switch out into my azumarill because

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
switch out into my azumarill because
this<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> incredibly<00:01:36.450> incredibly

look<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> try<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> lock<00:01:41.970> my<00:01:42.210> melodic<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
look to try and lock my melodic in but

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.569 
look to try and lock my melodic in but
now<00:01:43.380> you've<00:01:43.560> locked<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.070> azumarill

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
now you've locked in my azumarill

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
now you've locked in my azumarill
and<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.210> something<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and that's not something you want to be

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
and that's not something you want to be
locked<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.310> azumarill<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
locked into because this azumarill is a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.840 
locked into because this azumarill is a
belly<00:01:48.600> drum<00:01:48.990> set<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> citrus<00:01:50.460> berry<00:01:50.700> to

get half of that belly drum damaged back

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
get half of that belly drum damaged back
so<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> move<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.180> for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so that's the move I'm gonna go for

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.330 
so that's the move I'm gonna go for
right<00:01:54.570> away<00:01:54.689> he's<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.500> go<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> toxic

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
right away he's gonna go for the toxic

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
right away he's gonna go for the toxic
which<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:57.149> okay<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.899> alright

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
which I was okay with I was like alright

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.289 
which I was okay with I was like alright
I<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.320> take<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.619> damage<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I can take that damage and I'm going to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
get toxic so which means there's a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.410 
get toxic so which means there's a
ticking<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.159> bomb<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.490> azumarill<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
ticking time bomb on azumarill so I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
ticking time bomb on azumarill so I
might<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.750> well<00:02:03.780> turn<00:02:03.990> myself<00:02:04.170> into<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.590> ticking

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
might as well turn myself into a ticking

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.550 
might as well turn myself into a ticking
nuke<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.960> hit<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.320> belly

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
for the expert belt for protein and get

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.550 
for the expert belt for protein and get
some<00:04:07.569> good<00:04:07.690> damage<00:04:07.930> on<00:04:08.170> most<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.500> things

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
some good damage on most of the things

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.620 
some good damage on most of the things
but<00:04:09.340> if<00:04:09.459> not<00:04:09.639> I<00:04:09.700> could<00:04:10.060> send<00:04:10.239> him<00:04:10.359> out<00:04:10.480> here

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
but if not I could send him out here

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.870 
but if not I could send him out here
just<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:10.870> u-turn<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.470> send<00:04:12.310> myself<00:04:12.609> into

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
just a u-turn and send myself into

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.110 
just a u-turn and send myself into
something<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.750> properly<00:04:13.989> take<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.470> hit

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
something that can properly take the hit

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.190 
something that can properly take the hit
so<00:04:16.120> I'm<00:04:16.209> assuming<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.870> gonna<00:04:17.019> be<00:04:17.169> a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
so I'm assuming that this is gonna be a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.589 
so I'm assuming that this is gonna be a
special<00:04:17.500> Lucario<00:04:18.070> not<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:18.849> I<00:04:18.909> knew<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.390> was

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
special Lucario not that I knew I was

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.599 
special Lucario not that I knew I was
just<00:04:19.630> assuming<00:04:19.989> because<00:04:20.289> more<00:04:21.070> often<00:04:21.459> than

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
just assuming because more often than

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.070 
just assuming because more often than
not<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.909> Lucario<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.450> I've<00:04:22.570> seen<00:04:22.810> have<00:04:23.050> been

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
not the Lucario that I've seen have been

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.330 
not the Lucario that I've seen have been
special

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
special

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.560 
special
so<00:04:24.400> I'm<00:04:24.460> gonna<00:04:24.550> back<00:04:24.850> out<00:04:25.000> into<00:04:25.150> melodic

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
so I'm gonna back out into melodic

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.110 
so I'm gonna back out into melodic
