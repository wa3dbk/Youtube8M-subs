to go crash on the on the lowest notes

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.149 
to go crash on the on the lowest notes
obviously<00:05:57.449> brings<00:05:57.809> out<00:05:58.019> the<00:05:58.229> child<00:05:58.499> in<00:05:58.769> you<00:05:58.919> to

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:12.269 
getting carried away on this video i

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:15.079 
getting carried away on this video i
just<00:06:13.259> didn't<00:06:13.559> get<00:06:13.679> enough<00:06:13.829> keys<00:06:14.219> like<00:06:14.489> this<00:06:14.789> so

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.089 
just didn't get enough keys like this so

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.419 
just didn't get enough keys like this so
i<00:06:15.269> took<00:06:15.329> the<00:06:15.689> liberty<00:06:15.719> of<00:06:16.199> using<00:06:17.009> all<00:06:17.219> the

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.429 
i took the liberty of using all the

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:20.299 
i took the liberty of using all the
forearms<00:06:17.969> and<00:06:18.209> that<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.349> such<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:19.919> thrill

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:20.309 
forearms and that is such a thrill

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.579 
forearms and that is such a thrill
that's<00:06:20.669> of<00:06:20.849> course<00:06:20.999> when<00:06:21.239> the<00:06:21.269> asteroid<00:06:21.779> has

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
that's of course when the asteroid has

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.850 
that's of course when the asteroid has
the<00:06:22.800> collision<00:06:23.339> with<00:06:24.239> one<00:06:24.479> but<00:06:25.019> even<00:06:25.589> you

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
the collision with one but even you

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.559 
the collision with one but even you
sense<00:06:26.369> that<00:06:26.519> and<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:26.999> power<00:06:27.269> of<00:06:27.539> the

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
sense that and the power of the

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.949 
sense that and the power of the
instrument<00:06:28.349> that's<00:06:29.069> the<00:06:29.759> volume<00:06:30.509> that<00:06:30.719> comes

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:30.959 
instrument that's the volume that comes

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.049 
instrument that's the volume that comes
off<00:06:31.139> the<00:06:31.379> sound<00:06:31.649> board<00:06:31.979> because<00:06:32.279> of<00:06:32.579> that<00:06:32.789> and

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:33.059 
off the sound board because of that and

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.389 
off the sound board because of that and
then<00:06:33.899> all<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.139> dust<00:06:34.559> particles<00:06:35.099> flying

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:35.399 
then all the dust particles flying

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.319 
then all the dust particles flying
around<00:06:35.789> and<00:06:36.239> it's<00:06:37.169> just<00:06:37.379> a<00:06:37.529> fantastic<00:06:38.179> bit<00:06:39.179> of
