00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.780
 hi to all and with that of ts 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.610
 mobile.fr we are at mwc 2014 on the 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.650
 stand of acer and I have in hand the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.030
 acer liquid e 3 which is a terminal which 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.910
 arrived in the first week of April in 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.609
 France to 200 euros nude is a device 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 with a 4.7 inch HD screen that rotates 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.980
 on a quad core processor 1.2 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.590
 gigahertz 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.360
 it is dual sim as finally the 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.880
 vast majority of smartphones acer has 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.289
 recently it has that is that it has 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.329
 others I'm watching 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.860
 but alice yes we have a gig of ram 4 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.329
 gigas of internal memory a priori 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.120
 must be able to put a microsd but the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.650
 embarrassment but waited yeah we can put 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.850
 a micro sd on the side I show you 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.040
 to do it in a minute 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.590
 do not worry 13 megapixel in the back 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.030
 2 megapixel front camera with flash 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.950
 frontal is one of the big 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.149
 news on this terminal 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.920
 we are going to linger of course up on the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.340
 design of the beast where I'm not going to 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.149
 knock down 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.010
 it would be ok damage so there she was 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.270
 a flash goes up so why is it for 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.159
 when you take pictures in the saddle 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.200
 record yes suddenly a little disturbed by the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.310
 we are only a small camera 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
 frontal of fact it would have been 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.810
 interesting to have a 5 megapixel 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.490
 but hey there we observed the if I arrive 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.899
 to show with light it's a little 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.100
 complicated my abba chrome and multitasking 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.930
 volume right here and there one 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.479
 micro microphone excuse me I have to 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.840
 read with my little eyes closely we have 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.180
 micro sd there we have the two slots for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.350
 the asim and that this light is a little 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.420
 complicated we will go to the screen you 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.170
 do not worry you will be able to see 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.229
 has the bop micro usb jack at the wedding 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.659
 the camera at the back 13 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.610
 megapixels with the flash and this button 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.789
 so this little quick button you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 press once to unlock the screen 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.940
 to press a second time you 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.990
 launch a predefined application then 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.159
 I do not know it's a surprise 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.280
 apparently it's facebook 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.530
 if the screen is locked like that and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.020
 that you stay on the sidelines 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.740
 he will launch the camera next 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.880
 you can very well 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.649
 tac switch into that girls mode with the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.230
 Flash please how it's done 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.500
 to activate the flash 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 I do not know I look fast 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.450
 will take a picture to see not 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.040
 of flash it's not before they try to 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 montbéliard he is right about that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.549
 Fatigue is felt 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.049
 ok I do not know how to activate the 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.640
 flash in front but it is by a wine 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.829
 that you have a frontal flash and that 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.739
 must work then we are new 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.920
 version of the acer overlay with no 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.890
 a lot of new things in particular 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.930
 aesthetic we have a few 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.310
 elements including the appearance you the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.799
 see the quick access here that have 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.609
 changed did not show up like that 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.040
 previously 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.380
 notifications here we have multitasking 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.470
 with fleets apps that are integrated 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.269
 here we can go that way 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.430
 has a slightly greener approach 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.390
 it's a bit like open nvidia or 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.019
 nokia x1 so here we have hot menu 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.989
 main 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.680
 acer print snap our roads so I know 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.630
 not what it is but I have the impression 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.650
 that it's a utility that lets you 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.510
 take pictures to take pictures 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.890
 Notes 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 or in any case take notes 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.319
 in a way I do not know we'll see that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.250
 during the test 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.909
 we will not dwell on 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.890
 applications today tac or dial 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.079
 a number sent him a new typo a 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.129
 new general approach so that's 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.489
 rather rather nice so we'll go 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.980
 in a classic mode 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.459
 if you want it and there is this mode 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.780
 there that famous fashion that actually allows so 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.840
 I'm not mistaken it's a mode that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.190
 allows to manage the exposure based 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 an area on which you drop 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.780
 your finger and there is also a system 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430
 which is called bright magic on this 3 in 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.659
 fact that allows when you take a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.079
 cliché it's a little bit the way 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.450
 of the enlightenment of a scene on 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.099
 a lumia but without going that far 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.690
 so there for example I take a picture 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.349
 a priori what is it 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.049
 this is an August cessna ok that's snap 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.250
 okay that's fine and in fact the 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.650
 little feature so I'm talking to you 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.329
 and it's by default it's you go to 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.949
 that from you take a snapshot you 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.180
 have break magic that starts up 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.919
 there you have the effects up this little fashion 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.849
 here I do not know what it is 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.240
 exhibition be banal china is getting ready or 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.240
 defected 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 here 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.960
 here you see I can select to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.000
 the exhibition where I play I want that 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.639
 walk like that it seems to me that after 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.930
 you can slip there is something that that 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.110
 I miss a little but it's not 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.449
 we discover the good in the test 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.880
 do not worry I think it's up to 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.400
 just about everything for this little one not I 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.479
 looked at the calendar is that of 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.850
 android base that has not really changed 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.620
 photo here in more galleries but a 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.169
 weezer strapping that allows you 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.710
 to access everything that is cloud 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.710
 acer cloud 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.699
 the quick mode for those who are not 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:26.229
 family then there I do not know if I 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:29.110
 let's go to cat way basic mode 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.030
 you see the umih brightness contrast 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.259
 very strong here it is you have a mode 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.690
 basic seniors etc 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.879
 I can put classic of course as 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.319
 this and after I can customize the 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.300
 fashion normally so I'm the 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.800
 not quite master this system but 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.430
 it just allows you to have a 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.669
 system 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.050
 finally yes a simpler approach for 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.449
 those who are not familiar 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.190
 smartphones we can configure enough 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:06:00.280
 fast here and quid touch that's for 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:01.810
 for double clicks and it is that this 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.729
 that I was looking at is pretty much everything 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.250
 for this little this little game 3-1 appears 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.080
 interesting who has a beautiful design that 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.210
 will not be very expensive who has a camera 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.039
 interesting frontal in the sense that 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.840
 you have a frontal flash that is 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.069
 very unique and that's about it all so 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.599
 you have questions about this 3 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.930
 do not hesitate me I tell you to the 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.930
 next
