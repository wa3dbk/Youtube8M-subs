school makeup so the first thing I do is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.370

just<00:03:18.520> moisturize<00:03:19.030> my<00:03:19.270> face<00:03:24.690> then<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.810> go<00:03:25.990> on<00:03:26.170> to

my foundation which I use is the true
match<00:03:29.400> lore'l<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.670> think<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.210> such<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.450> good

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
match lore'l I think this is such a good

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.510 
match lore'l I think this is such a good
foundation<00:03:32.140> for<00:03:32.560> school<00:03:32.980> because<00:03:33.310> it's

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
foundation for school because it's

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.460 
foundation for school because it's
really<00:03:33.910> light<00:03:34.210> but<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.570> has<00:03:34.690> such<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> good<00:03:35.230> full

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
really light but it has such a good full

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.190 
really light but it has such a good full
coverage<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.250> stays<00:03:36.550> on<00:03:36.660> pretty<00:03:37.660> much<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
coverage and it stays on pretty much the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.160 
coverage and it stays on pretty much the
whole<00:03:38.230> day<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.790> definitely<00:03:40.240> recommend<00:03:40.690> this

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
whole day so I definitely recommend this

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.750 
whole day so I definitely recommend this
foundation<00:03:41.770> if<00:03:41.890> your<00:03:42.010> school<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.490> bit

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
foundation if your school is a bit

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.700 
foundation if your school is a bit
stricter<00:03:43.240> on<00:03:43.360> makeup<00:03:43.780> because<00:03:44.050> like<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.650> said

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
stricter on makeup because like I said

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.830 
stricter on makeup because like I said
it's<00:03:45.130> not<00:03:45.490> that<00:03:45.760> Nerdist<00:03:46.150> one<00:03:46.270> it's<00:03:46.480> pretty

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
