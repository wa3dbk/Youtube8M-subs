00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
time to try and figure out why this

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.990 
time to try and figure out why this
would<00:02:00.990> happen<00:02:01.020> exactly<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.759> said

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
would happen exactly and like I said

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.679 
would happen exactly and like I said
before<00:02:03.119> he's<00:02:03.780> only<00:02:03.930> 28<00:02:04.320> years<00:02:04.409> old<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
before he's only 28 years old and

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.059 
before he's only 28 years old and
someone<00:02:06.689> passing<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.350> such<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> young<00:02:08.039> age

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
someone passing at such a young age

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.490 
someone passing at such a young age
really<00:02:08.550> puts<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> perspective<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.450> life

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
really puts a perspective on life

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.850

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
being off the ice and it really it

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180 
being off the ice and it really it
really<00:02:15.600> hurts<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.350> someone<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.800> go
