but<00:04:14.850> as<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.300> see<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:17.390> always<00:04:18.390> keep<00:04:18.720> up<00:04:19.340> in

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
but as you can see I always keep up in

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.850 
but as you can see I always keep up in
temperature<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:20.940> humidity<00:04:21.000> gauge<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.989> always

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
temperature and humidity gauge I always

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.750 
temperature and humidity gauge I always
keep<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.250> humidity<00:04:23.520> between<00:04:24.120> 75<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.200> 90

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
keep the humidity between 75 and 90

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.980 
keep the humidity between 75 and 90
notice<00:04:26.760> how<00:04:26.880> none<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.150> my<00:04:27.390> turtles<00:04:27.810> have

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
notice how none of my turtles have

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.950 
notice how none of my turtles have
pyramiding<00:04:29.210> they<00:04:30.210> all<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.480> very<00:04:30.510> healthy

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
pyramiding they all have very healthy

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.470 
pyramiding they all have very healthy
shells<00:04:34.640> also<00:04:35.640> here<00:04:35.910> with<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> lighting

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
shells also here with the lighting

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.980 
shells also here with the lighting
system<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.990> have<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:38.790> has<00:04:39.450> their<00:04:39.630> UV

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
system that I have it's has their UV

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.510 
system that I have it's has their UV
rays<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.260> all<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.650> vitamins<00:04:41.100> come<00:04:41.280> out<00:04:41.400> of

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
rays and all the vitamins come out of

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.860 
rays and all the vitamins come out of
there<00:04:41.640> they<00:04:41.820> only<00:04:41.940> last<00:04:42.180> about<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:42.480> year<00:04:42.720> though

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
there they only last about a year though

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.200 
there they only last about a year though
so<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.230> change<00:04:43.440> them<00:04:43.560> every<00:04:43.680> year

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
so you have to change them every year

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.030 
so you have to change them every year
but<00:04:45.210> every<00:04:45.990> day<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.200> bring<00:04:46.500> them<00:04:46.590> outside<00:04:46.770> for

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
but every day I bring them outside for

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.720 
but every day I bring them outside for
an<00:04:47.340> hour<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.820> live<00:04:48.300> in<00:04:48.390> South<00:04:48.570> Florida<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.730> they

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
an hour I live in South Florida so they

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.549 
an hour I live in South Florida so they
get<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.910> lot<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.120> Sun

00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:57.559 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:03.279 

and<00:04:59.739> until<00:05:00.739> next<00:05:00.949> time
