00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.519
 and then guys I'm going to show today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 how to make animations in powerpoint 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.580
 powerpoint is a program that many 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.680
 people I underestimate but there is enough 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.619
 what a small thing here not so many people 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.260
 know how to do and you can use it enough 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 enough to edit images or even 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.050
 make animations and today is what 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 is talking about making animations in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 powerpoint recalling that the pope says that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 She is using it's 2007 for me. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 I think it's a version of the package 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 used to have good I'll make a 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:56.210
 any shape that a round ball 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.210
 basketball 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 I have this ball 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 Let's take this one and I have it. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.700
 also a hoop 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:19.229
 This is because the basketball I have 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:35.720
 one side in it without filling leaves 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:35.720
 here only black with a cute in the sixth 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.070
 lot 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:53.850
 this is ours is our sixth 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.340
 Now let's suppose that I want 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 I want this ball to go in here and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.979
 fall here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 good is this one that is the secret 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:13.770
 we will vote to format 11 in animations 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.980
 and now we are going to animate 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.590
 custom leaving the ball 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.330
 selected will open that water jack 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.560
 of the year we're going to have to add 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.590
 effects 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.030
 we have all these input levels 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 on exit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 input is an object to try to emphasize is 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.770
 When he's already there, he's not leaving. 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.650
 he will only do some one scene and the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.740
 exit for him to leave the canvas but the people 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330
 go already this one from here you can see that the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.360
 We have several people here in stagnation 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.930
 we also have several ways of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.160
 his animation and let's use this here 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.540
 animation drawing will use a scribble 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.330
 or if you want, you can make a 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.590
 curve but but but surely use 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.720
 scribble from here we get on the ball does 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.590
 the scribble so far it will show in 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.420
 followed what I did 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.780
 now we have here 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.340
 by clicking there we go because the part f5 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.340
 when I click 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:35.920
 She goes for it now, I want it. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.709
 swat it down and exit the screen 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.790
 Let's do the following, let's add 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.850
 another scribble effect they started 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.850
 on here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.580
 below the earth leaving the screen appears 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.230
 as well as requiring starting from 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.080
 But, yes we will. We will. 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.820
 to hold here knows that we 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:04.000
 did and we'll take you up here in the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.890
 end of this track and something else will 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.320
 to stay more or less so we'll go 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.810
 Click it will get up there it goes 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.670
 click back and it will fall 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.709
 We do not want this, we want it. 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.480
 She comes here, she spends some time. 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.660
 automatically drops 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.290
 we do here we select 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.410
 here and we will not put when clicking 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.630
 after the previous time 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:37.200
 then with 1 and then came if you want to see 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.200
 25 soon arrived she falls 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.290
 It's more or less like that if I wanted to 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.979
 time your case for example over time 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.580
 previous 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.890
 Look how it would look both ways. 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.840
 happening at the same time and that's where 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.250
 that did not even appear right 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.260
 so when we want to do animation 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.010
 where you put the first one by clicking and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.720
 then we have places after time 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.510
 previous 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.150
 You can select ke ha speed 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.280
 in the case a basketball more 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.460
 kept the place very fast 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.020
 that's right I played and I fell 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.450
 We can do other types 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.570
 animations can also make animations 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.479
 much more complex as it is lupi fight 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.220
 No more little men will stick 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.669
 to draw friends toothpick 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:32.410
 we can do several other things 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.850
 but the basics is that there is only that for 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.010
 video of today I 'm thinking of 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.789
 other things like editing photos as 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.020
 powerpoint edit is to do several other 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.729
 things 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.750
 but for now the videos of today only 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.690
 Thank you so much 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.390
 Like clicking on the jewel below if you 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.940
 if you want to see more videos like this 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:58.090
 which is inscribed in the channel and they are the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.090
 Czech favorites are nearby
