00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.560 
underneath I can put a new bridge plate
underneath<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.170> made<00:04:01.320> out<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.560> maple

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
underneath that I made out of maple

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.300 
underneath that I made out of maple
underneath<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.960> bridge<00:04:04.170> there's<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.650> plate

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
underneath the bridge there's a plate

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.550 
underneath the bridge there's a plate
I<00:04:05.340> wouldn't<00:04:05.730> plate<00:04:05.970> it's<00:04:06.210> about<00:04:06.360> an<00:04:06.530> eighth<00:04:07.530> of

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
I wouldn't plate it's about an eighth of

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.780 
I wouldn't plate it's about an eighth of
an<00:04:07.800> inch<00:04:07.890> thick<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.920> has<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.340> go<00:04:11.460> under

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
an inch thick and that has to go under

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.150 
an inch thick and that has to go under
there<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.210> hold<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.930> strings<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.590> properly<00:04:14.040> so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
there to hold the strings on properly so

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.470 
there to hold the strings on properly so
they<00:04:14.250> don't<00:04:14.400> come<00:04:14.640> pulling<00:04:14.940> through<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.180> top

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
they don't come pulling through the top

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.289 
they don't come pulling through the top
so<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.109> have<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.320> build<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.590> new<00:04:16.739> one
