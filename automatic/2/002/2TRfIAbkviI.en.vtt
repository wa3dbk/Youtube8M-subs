really<00:02:10.170> far<00:02:10.439> apart<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.519> started<00:02:12.120> off<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.390> D<00:02:12.569> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
really far apart I started off at D I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.830 
really far apart I started off at D I
mean<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.049> was<00:02:13.400> ten<00:02:14.400> pounds<00:02:14.700> heavier<00:02:14.969> but<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.510> was

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
mean I was ten pounds heavier but I was

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
mean I was ten pounds heavier but I was
a<00:02:15.870> D<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:16.469> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.799> really<00:02:17.069> small<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.609> me<00:02:17.730> my

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
a D so this is really small for me my

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.059 
a D so this is really small for me my
breast<00:02:18.269> surgeon<00:02:18.569> tells<00:02:18.719> me<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.109> size<00:02:19.469> C<00:02:19.859> right

breast surgeon tells me I'm size C right

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.399 
breast surgeon tells me I'm size C right
now<00:02:20.219> I<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.609> not<00:02:20.819> believe<00:02:21.030> him<00:02:21.239> but<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.959> will<00:02:22.260> wait

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
now I do not believe him but I will wait

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.830 
now I do not believe him but I will wait
until<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:23.549> mean<00:02:23.849> there's<00:02:24.359> nothing<00:02:24.450> else<00:02:24.689> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
until I mean there's nothing else I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.179 
until I mean there's nothing else I
could<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.109> either<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.469> don't<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:25.889> my<00:02:25.950> skin

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
could do either I don't think my skin

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.039 
could do either I don't think my skin
will<00:02:26.310> stretch<00:02:26.430> anymore<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.480> I'll<00:02:27.719> just<00:02:27.870> wait

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
will stretch anymore so I'll just wait

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.420 
will stretch anymore so I'll just wait
until<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.319> final<00:02:28.439> surgery<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.129> hopefully

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
until the final surgery and hopefully

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.559 
until the final surgery and hopefully
they'll<00:02:29.609> be<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.879> bit<00:02:30.090> bigger<00:02:30.299> and

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
they'll be a little bit bigger and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.330 
they'll be a little bit bigger and
hopefully<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:31.680> lose<00:02:31.829> a<00:02:31.859> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.129> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
