00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.520
 actually get a fairly short duel 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.970
 but from now we can see an exotic South African landscape its flame 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.750
 South African suggestive South African all very south africa do not continue studies ricardo

 I was not going to move 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.169
 he says it was a very close game he will reap the studio surcharge for the 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.049

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.310
 they inform us that they have injured the forum asturias enrique Ã¡lvarez 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.490
 I really do not think it's anything serious is a simple ankle sprain 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.719
 but I know what you have to do seeing things 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.579
 according to the study 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.289

 now it will be dedicated now 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.750
 the meeting has been very tired on the internal level to discuss and know 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
 shortly 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.809
 the rtbf 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.809

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.809
 of exclusive press to which not everyone can enter 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.080

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:05.999

 training of the south africa national team 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.220
 and I have to say it's a shame this incredible 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.339
 faults and indiscriminate hands left and right but due to the harsh 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.339
 Ricardo and Jorge died to soccer 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.909
