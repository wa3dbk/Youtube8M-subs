00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:02.240 
well I think English got a good chance

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.999 
well I think English got a good chance
because<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:04.049> know<00:00:04.170> we've<00:00:04.560> had<00:00:04.680> some

excellent games up to the last two

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.839 
excellent games up to the last two
friendlies<00:00:08.460> which<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.820> was<00:00:09.719> disappointed<00:00:10.200> him

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
friendlies which I was disappointed him

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.280 
friendlies which I was disappointed him
and<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.030> know<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.870> will<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.259> that

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and I know and they will know that

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.250 
and I know and they will know that
they'll<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> play<00:00:14.280> better<00:00:14.730> than<00:00:15.260> they

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
they'll have to play better than they

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.920 
they'll have to play better than they
did<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.470> those<00:00:16.710> two<00:00:17.070> friendlies<00:00:17.570> but<00:00:18.570> I'm

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
did in those two friendlies but I'm

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960 
did in those two friendlies but I'm
gonna<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.699> group

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
gonna look for them in that first group

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.050 
gonna look for them in that first group
I<00:00:21.420> believe<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> hardest<00:00:22.800> game<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.699> against

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
I believe the hardest game is against

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.380 
I believe the hardest game is against
America<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> that's<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> first<00:00:25.680> game<00:00:26.390> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
America and that's the first game and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.210 
America and that's the first game and
there<00:00:27.930> won't<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.260> no<00:00:28.410> pushover<00:00:28.859> because

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
there won't be no pushover because

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
there won't be no pushover because
there's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.820> few<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> them<00:00:30.420> playing<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm looking for England to be solid at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
I'm looking for England to be solid at
the<00:00:45.239> bank<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:46.079> giving<00:00:46.440> anything<00:00:46.680> away<00:00:46.920> giving

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the bank not giving anything away giving

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
the bank not giving anything away giving
very<00:00:47.730> few<00:00:47.969> chances<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.480> people<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
very few chances for people to get a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.950 
very few chances for people to get a
shot<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.800> goal<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> sort<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> thing

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
shot in at goal and that sort of thing

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.569 
shot in at goal and that sort of thing
moving<00:00:51.960> forward<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> unit<00:00:53.010> I'm<00:00:53.219> playing

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
moving forward as a unit I'm playing

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.959 
moving forward as a unit I'm playing
some<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.930> team<00:00:55.410> football<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.280> individual

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
some good team football not individual

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
some good team football not individual
football<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.570> knocking<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.620> getting

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
football but knocking it about getting

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
football but knocking it about getting
up<00:00:59.520> there<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> creating<00:01:00.960> chances<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
up there and creating chances and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.410 
up there and creating chances and
scoring<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> few<00:01:02.309> goals<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
scoring a few goals at the start and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
scoring a few goals at the start and
then<00:01:03.989> I'll<00:01:04.320> say<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.799> England's<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> good

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
then I'll say that England's got a good

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
then I'll say that England's got a good
chance<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.860> doing

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
chance but if we get through not doing

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.250 
chance but if we get through not doing
that<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.240> sort<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> scraping<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that you know it's sort of scraping and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
that you know it's sort of scraping and
scratching<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.150> very<00:01:12.540> very

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
scratching then it will be very very

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
scratching then it will be very very
difficult<00:01:13.280> Steven<00:01:14.280> Gerrard<00:01:14.780> yeah<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.930> sure

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
difficult Steven Gerrard yeah I'm sure

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
difficult Steven Gerrard yeah I'm sure
and<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> good<00:01:16.710> captain<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.840> captain

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and make a good captain but a captain

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.940 
and make a good captain but a captain
doesn't<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.720> make<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> huge<00:01:22.259> difference<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
doesn't really make a huge difference to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.200 
doesn't really make a huge difference to
a<00:01:22.979> team<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> players<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
a team it's it's the players that get to
