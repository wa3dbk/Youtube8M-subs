00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.480
 nice guys and welcome back to the comparison 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.069
 two channel 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.870
 we came back with the useful young robot 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.880
 thanks in this video a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 I mean, casino for registration 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.670
 we play the first game is fine 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 beautiful game and everything we go to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 second I realize that he doesn't have it 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.560
 registered at the best soccer 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.850
 winning 6 to 1 did not register me 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.619
 why the computer got stuck 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.420
 let's get on with the game another 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.400
 so they see another nothing to do 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.050
 guys because the microphone doesn't 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.349
 it worked I realized that for everything 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.939
 the video will be turned off me guys 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.719
 I'm sorry but you can see mine 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.059
 substances here without audio obviously with 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.140
 this guys wanted to tell you that since 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.670
 next video i will come back with mine 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 risk back and therefore in this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.360
 video making and commenting with you and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 so guys I wish you a good one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 vision 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 and then we guys are off we go 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.700
 right away with this first game I had 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 tried the 3 5 2 guys i wanted 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 change it but I have to say that respect 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.449
 however to the other modalities that is the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.789
 foot mode is very different than in 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.460
 that season and also to the mode 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.260
 career of facts with 35 that I am not 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.479
 found very well 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.130
 I don't know why , maybe because maybe 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.909
 let's say he immediately went ahead 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 in the sixth minute with a roll of annarita 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.520
 I don't know how to use what he has 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.920
 done approved so he managed to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 put it inside let's say that buffon has me 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.610
 left a little to be desired 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.170
 purchases say how they are 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.119
 they go a little bit every now and then 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.829
 we have to accept it but we are 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 been forced to change form immediately 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.520
 because obviously against the defenders 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.770
 we leave too many too many spaces 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.900
 holes and therefore we risk to press 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 a lot e 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.110
 and I must say that I preferred to return to the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 old 4 2 3 1 and okay nothing of that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.890
 although I thought I was improving anyway 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.750
 let's say the situation at least 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 initially I also did some 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 change but I have to say we are here 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.780
 always found yourself in a little bit 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.390
 strange because we had a back room 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.740
 left which is not home 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.810
 a right back then we are a 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.700
 little open on the outside and then later 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.040
 only 7 minutes of gameplay even goes into 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 advantage of two goals boys chiellini 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.020
 he made a sensational head hole not 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.490
 I was expecting it right in the sky 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.290
 I thought he would take it 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.420
 instead you gave 1 cm forward e 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.740
 lewandowski has arrived behind if 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
 let's say the first time was a 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.400
 a little terrible because ours 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.530
 very good opponent on defense 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.800
 then he found two rather strange goals 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.840
 so I decided to change the form 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.270
 that is excuse the players not the form 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.860
 also for what we did it we have 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.520
 inserted two sprinters in short doubt and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.680
 gervinho and in fact with with this new 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.410
 placement ie to be a boys 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.800
 resounding we managed to find the 2 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.090
 to 1 boys at the 62nd I have to say that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.410
 I tried it this is one of the first 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.610
 times I had a thing 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.019
 awesome just the real bomber 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.880
 serving up front for each team 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 so obviously for the series I ve 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 I really recommend it because it is both 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.190
 enough physical but place all 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.500
 The 82nd kids ate this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.380
 just not me 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.959
 I was expecting it but we can say that yes 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.970
 will certainly redo it because thanks to a 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.470
 pretend to choose on the band and then the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.720
 puts you in the middle of a street you find yourself 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.000
 ready and even 2 this match was 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.140
 practically lost now because the 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.540
 our opponent was very good at 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.100
 depending however he also found the goal e 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.049
 which closed very well but we are 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.330
 managed to find these two goals thanks 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.489
 double and the phone rang 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.980
 wait for manhart but we have 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.269
 practically found the draw in one 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.130
 game that by now had become 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.780
 difficult we also did a lot of shots 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.459
 in the second half we played 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 only we, however, have found this 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.510
 first Parisian in this division 2 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.130
 because we started from division two 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.859
 obviously guys because the trail wing 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.519
 skipped because if it didn't last 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.320
 really a lot and I have to say that the 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.850
 game later it blew like I told you 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.250
 she did n't register it before sex 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.200
 I won 6 1 express a crazy kick 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.340
 but I'm really sorry guys that don't 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.109
 you could see it because it was 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.400
 really fun but also with mine 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.070
 celebrations 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.019
 oh well we will do it again anyway and immediately after 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.459
 we have therefore found 4 points 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.889
 but immediately after we found this 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.480
 silver team let's face it series 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.100
 even a little lucky I don't know if 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.919
 apparently does not argenton the luggage I have to say the 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.100
 truth is immediately but a mistake 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.169
 shift to the 23rd doumbia jumps all 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.169
 sees giorgini eolica slipping with col 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.760
 strange tricks these throws puts it 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.440
 inside it is immediately 1 to 0 look at that 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.360
 shot of our old trafford stadium 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.900
 besides he had the manchester and that 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.830
 the thing played ambiguously in my home though 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.520
 finally our players are 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.880
 so exalted and immediately after 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.700
 45th minute and again with 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.080
 badly played ball let's say it's the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.070
 our opponent we recover the ball 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.930
 thanks to steal a little goes there immediately to 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.240
 umbria and a plastic that is centered 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.220
 regards carlitos tevez burning at 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.470
 his opponent and then puts it to 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.180
 flat on the side of the goalkeeper and between 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.500
 the other was courtois the only one who was not 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.540
 silvery just our opponent 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.430
 however, try to start again 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.190
 beaten let's call it sector out of the bar of 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.199
 pogba ball launch immediately doumbia that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.040
 with a photocopy action to that of 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:21.650
 first the flat in boys 3 to 0 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.720
 this match was then quotes 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.220
 easy because after 45 minutes 3 to 0 a 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.290
 little to make relax but ours 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.260
 opponent I must say that it was not then 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.940
 so bad is because anyway he showed 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.720
 of knowing how to play then I don't know if 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.130
 Argentoni team here is a little bit 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.600
 a little bit worse indeed as 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.680
 you can see in this action all of 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.330
 before he did it really well 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.550
 inseparable also because the attacker 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.280
 He ran a lot located in the middle of her 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.680
 teammate and makes 3 to 1 to 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.229
 54th so we succeeded however in 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.910
 then contain them from the eightieth and then 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.250
 we have done so many actions 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.590
 guys including this paul punishments 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.620
 pogba va courtois from this distance not 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.330
 he absolutely gets fooled but beyond 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.639
 we ate a little of this 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.220
 from here you can do this with doumbia 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.449
 that I wanted to exaggerate trying to 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.460
 to leave right at speed 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.280
 big but the goalkeeper blocked us 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.660
 with an advanced and then to remember 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.550
 this action the ball on the ground that 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.720
 ends up on the pole but really quite 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.479
 unlucky then again bomb against 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.570
 courtois parade once again 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.070
 finally giorgino who turns this value 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.199
 for doumbia which in turn by candreva 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.449
 that with a cleat he leaves 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.009
 beats ambiguously then the culture 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.289
 defender saves her on the line 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.300
 and the moment we were about to beat 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.889
 this free kick is ours 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.960
 pursue so we won the 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.330
 match 3 to 1 I have to say that way 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.800
 pretty good though i'm sorry that i don't 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.000
 there was the green screen but the 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.310
 next time there will certainly be 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.440
 this fact also sees the fia 16 005 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.820
 I tell you with 7 points I greet you and al 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.820
 next video hi guys
