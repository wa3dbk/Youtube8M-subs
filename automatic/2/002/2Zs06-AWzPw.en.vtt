we<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.700> wanted<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
we really wanted to have is that the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.240 
we really wanted to have is that the
kitchen<00:00:37.469> would<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.160> be

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to be interesting but they need to be

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
to be interesting but they need to be
balanced<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.840> we've<00:01:57.960> done<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> made<00:01:59.100> sure

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
balanced so what we've done is made sure

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
balanced so what we've done is made sure
that<00:01:59.729> everything<00:02:00.300> surrounding<00:02:00.720> those<00:02:01.290> those

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that everything surrounding those those

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.930 
that everything surrounding those those
walls<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.030> quiet<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.410> we<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:05.039> kept<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
walls are is quiet so we have kept the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.900 
walls are is quiet so we have kept the
finishes<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> colors<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.130> minimum<00:02:08.640> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
finishes and the colors to a minimum so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.390 
finishes and the colors to a minimum so
that<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.450> white<00:02:10.259> cabinets<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.130> white

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that we have white cabinets and white

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.440 
that we have white cabinets and white
countertops<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> we've<00:02:14.310> been<00:02:14.580> looking<00:02:15.060> at<00:02:15.360> an

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
countertops so we've been looking at an

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.500 
countertops so we've been looking at an
antique<00:02:15.810> brass<00:02:16.170> sink<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.910> lacquered<00:02:18.390> brass

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
antique brass sink on lacquered brass

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.310 
antique brass sink on lacquered brass
and<00:02:19.610> we've<00:02:20.610> been<00:02:20.790> trying<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> figure<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:21.840> how

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
and we've been trying to figure out how

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.850 
and we've been trying to figure out how
to<00:02:22.380> make<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.250> hood<00:02:23.670> work<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> cool

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to make this hood work we have a cool

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.660 
to make this hood work we have a cool
asymmetrical<00:02:26.760> hood<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.540> space

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
asymmetrical hood in this space

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.910 
asymmetrical hood in this space
originally<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.910> orange<00:02:30.600> at<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.470> time<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
originally it was orange at a time that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.390 
originally it was orange at a time that
was<00:02:32.040> black<00:02:32.340> most<00:02:32.850> recently<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.510> white<00:02:34.400> but

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
was black most recently it was white but

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.620 
was black most recently it was white but
we<00:02:35.489> didn't<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.060> anything<00:02:36.209> was

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
we didn't really think anything was

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.460 
we didn't really think anything was
working<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.970> recently<00:02:38.970> we've<00:02:39.209> we've<00:02:39.690> moved<00:02:40.260> on

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
working so recently we've we've moved on

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400 
working so recently we've we've moved on
to<00:02:40.650> hardware<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.310> sometimes<00:02:42.180> things<00:02:42.660> help

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
to hardware and sometimes things help

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.309 
to hardware and sometimes things help
dictate<00:02:43.860> other<00:02:44.370> things<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
dictate other things in

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.670 
dictate other things in
so<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.440> came<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:48.440> came<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.590> with

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
so we came in with this I came in with

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.040 
so we came in with this I came in with
this<00:02:49.800> piece<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.069> hardware<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.780> showed

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
this piece of hardware and showed

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.229 
this piece of hardware and showed
Brendon<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.489> really<00:02:53.879> clicked

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
Brendon and it just all really clicked

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.210 
Brendon and it just all really clicked
and<00:02:54.569> Brendon<00:02:54.989> had<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.230> great<00:02:55.470> idea<00:02:55.530> of

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and Brendon had this great idea of

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.080 
and Brendon had this great idea of
actually<00:02:57.000> making<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.450> hood<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.989> brass<00:02:59.090> so

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
actually making the hood in brass so

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.789 
actually making the hood in brass so
that<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.450> brass<00:03:00.720> was<00:03:01.050> really<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> central

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
that the brass was really a central

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.190 
that the brass was really a central
finish<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.640> wall<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:03.959> kind<00:03:04.110> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
finish for this wall on this kind of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.430 
finish for this wall on this kind of
cool<00:03:04.549> glazed<00:03:05.549> brick<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.599> then<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.930> also<00:03:07.110> have

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
cool glazed brick so then you also have

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
cool glazed brick so then you also have
this<00:03:07.650> stove<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.190> has<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.670> hint<00:03:08.970> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
this stove which has a little hint of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300 
this stove which has a little hint of
brass<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.530> does<00:03:10.769> all<00:03:10.980> came

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
brass so it really does all came

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.039 
brass so it really does all came
together<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.510> notion<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
together that there is this notion of

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.030 
together that there is this notion of
white<00:03:13.940> textured<00:03:14.940> white<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:15.750> brass<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
white textured white and then brass so

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.300 
white textured white and then brass so
very<00:03:17.519> quickly<00:03:17.880> we've<00:03:18.269> been<00:03:19.310> everything's

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
very quickly we've been everything's

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.380 
very quickly we've been everything's
kind<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.549> coming<00:03:20.610> together<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> kitchen

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
kind of coming together with the kitchen

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.759 
kind of coming together with the kitchen
