report very well we did our thing we
blocked<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.880> served<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.300> past<00:00:30.540> really

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
blocked and we served in past really

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
blocked and we served in past really
well<00:00:31.080> currently<00:00:31.710> distributed<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> offense

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
well currently distributed the offense

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360 
well currently distributed the offense
we<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.120> high<00:00:33.510> efficiency<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:34.620> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
we are high efficiency in that way we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
we are high efficiency in that way we
dug<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> lot<00:00:35.970> of<00:00:36.090> balls<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.809> think<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
dug a lot of balls and I think that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
dug a lot of balls and I think that
that's<00:00:37.680> always<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.400> good<00:00:38.550> indication<00:00:38.970> when<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that's always a good indication when you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
that's always a good indication when you
really<00:00:39.629> block<00:00:39.840> well<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> dig<00:00:40.470> well<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.190> didn't

mental<00:00:55.949> focus<00:00:56.070> after<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.330> actually<00:00:57.720> win

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
mental focus after that to actually win

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.689 
mental focus after that to actually win
a<00:00:57.900> set<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.470> we<00:00:58.620> hadn't<00:00:58.979> they<00:00:59.550> would

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a set because if we hadn't they would

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.799 
a set because if we hadn't they would
have<00:00:59.790> taken<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> from<00:01:00.330> us<00:01:00.540> they<00:01:00.720> were

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have taken it from us they were

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
have taken it from us they were
definitely<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> play<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.309> was

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
definitely there to play I think I was

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
definitely there to play I think I was
really<00:01:02.580> good<00:01:02.729> we<00:01:02.850> got<00:01:03.089> him<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.360> really<00:01:03.540> well

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
really good we got him in really well

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
really good we got him in really well
and<00:01:04.050> uh<00:01:05.180> their<00:01:06.180> office<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.960> fast<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and uh their office is really fast that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.750 
and uh their office is really fast that
they're<00:01:07.560> hitting<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:08.040> lower<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.370> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
they're hitting a little lower and I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
they're hitting a little lower and I
think<00:01:08.940> we<00:01:09.030> did<00:01:09.120> a<00:01:09.180> good<00:01:09.299> job<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.510> getting<00:01:09.840> over

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
think we did a good job of getting over

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.440 
think we did a good job of getting over
early<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.820> shutting<00:01:11.820> down<00:01:11.970> some<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> they're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
early and shutting down some of they're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.010 
early and shutting down some of they're
bigger<00:01:12.870> hitters<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> scouted<00:01:15.870> them

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
bigger hitters which is we scouted them

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.180

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
matches at one point we wouldn't what

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
matches at one point we wouldn't what
nine<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.049> our<00:02:04.109> last<00:02:04.350> 11<00:02:04.859> up<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
we put together some nice runs and I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.139 
we put together some nice runs and I
think<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.610> things<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.030> build

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
think we have a lot of things to build

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.300 
think we have a lot of things to build
on<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.570> future

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.280 

haley<00:02:17.030> pleased<00:02:17.270> with<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.690> intensity<00:02:18.080> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
haley pleased with the intensity that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.350 
haley pleased with the intensity that
our<00:02:18.440> team<00:02:18.650> came<00:02:18.860> out<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.310> thought<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.849> North

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
our team came out I thought that North

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
our team came out I thought that North
Carolina<00:02:20.780> was<00:02:21.020> well<00:02:21.200> prepared<00:02:21.380> for<00:02:21.830> us<00:02:21.950> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
Carolina was well prepared for us and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.180 
Carolina was well prepared for us and
they<00:02:22.310> were<00:02:22.790> doing<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.270> lot<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.569> things<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.230> try

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
they were doing a lot of things to try

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.740 
they were doing a lot of things to try
to<00:02:25.220> slow<00:02:25.489> us<00:02:25.640> down<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.030> make<00:02:26.150> some<00:02:26.330> changes<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
to slow us down and make some changes in

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.449 
to slow us down and make some changes in
our<00:02:26.959> game<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.590> thought<00:02:27.739> that<00:02:27.980> at<00:02:28.220> least

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
our game but I thought that at least

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.910 
our game but I thought that at least
sets<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.150> two<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.540> were<00:02:29.690> nearly<00:02:30.319> perfect

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
sets one and two we were nearly perfect

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.720 
sets one and two we were nearly perfect
and<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:32.590> felt<00:02:33.590> good<00:02:33.920> about<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.400> chemistry

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and just felt good about the chemistry

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.400 
and just felt good about the chemistry
that<00:02:34.880> was<00:02:35.090> out<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.569> communication<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
that was out there the communication the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.170 
that was out there the communication the
desire<00:02:36.709> people<00:02:37.099> were<00:02:37.160> going<00:02:37.370> after<00:02:37.489> balls<00:02:37.819> our

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
desire people were going after balls our

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.690 
desire people were going after balls our
block<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.599> setting<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:38.959> pretty<00:02:39.200> good<00:02:39.700> passing

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
block was setting up pretty good passing

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.890 
block was setting up pretty good passing

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
very well we scaled them for a while

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
them out of system enough and then they

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.300 
them out of system enough and then they
were<00:03:33.200> able<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.410> run<00:03:33.530> their<00:03:33.650> middles<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.069> we

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
and I think we need to block that we

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.870 
and I think we need to block that we
need<00:03:42.350> play<00:03:42.530> each<00:03:42.829> party<00:03:43.459> gained<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.640> lil<00:03:43.760> bit

think the strength of cow is the fact
that<00:03:48.139> they<00:03:48.380> play<00:03:48.769> very<00:03:49.100> high<00:03:50.060> percentage
