be using through the hair so I'm gonna
be<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.759> taking<00:01:21.479> randomized<00:01:22.439> sections

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
be actually taking randomized sections

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.580 
be actually taking randomized sections
taking<00:01:24.420> mousse<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.490> bowl<00:01:27.320> applying<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
taking mousse in the bowl applying it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
taking mousse in the bowl applying it
all<00:01:29.100> through<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.509> hair<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.319> finally<00:01:31.770> with

two fingers so this is where you have

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.760 
two fingers so this is where you have
the<00:01:33.479> choice<00:01:33.719> you<00:01:33.929> can<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.170> two<00:01:34.350> fingers<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the choice you can do two fingers you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.459 
the choice you can do two fingers you
can<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.189> three<00:01:35.429> fingers<00:01:36.140> regardless<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.380> the

fingers turning it around a little bit
more<00:02:05.819> like<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:05.999> pin<00:02:06.509> curl<00:02:06.810> type<00:02:07.319> of<00:02:07.499> set<00:02:07.709> but<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
more like a pin curl type of set but it

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.760 
more like a pin curl type of set but it
moves<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:08.940> happens<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.600> mousse<00:02:09.869> what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
moves what happens with the mousse what

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.550 
moves what happens with the mousse what
it<00:02:10.890> does<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.610> apply<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.240> dry<00:02:12.480> hair<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it does is apply on dry hair this is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
it does is apply on dry hair this is
one<00:02:13.680> thing<00:02:13.920> that's<00:02:14.130> why<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.610> time

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
one thing that's why it's not time

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
one thing that's why it's not time
consuming<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.440> fiber<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.069> time

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
consuming so the fiber that's not time

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.210 
consuming so the fiber that's not time
consuming<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.970> mousse<00:02:18.150> acts<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.620> wet

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
consuming the mousse acts like a wet

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.660 
consuming the mousse acts like a wet
agent<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.590> actually<00:02:22.590> remould

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
agent to actually remould

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.110 
agent to actually remould
the<00:02:23.819> hair<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.930> another<00:02:25.530> fashion<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.310> by<00:02:26.880> doing

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the hair in another fashion and by doing

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.280 
the hair in another fashion and by doing
that<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.630> well

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that as well

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.140 
that as well
what<00:02:28.680> happens<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.370> mousse<00:02:29.580> has<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.849> little

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
what happens is the mousse has a little

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.990 
what happens is the mousse has a little
hold<00:02:30.480> factor<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.530> by<00:02:31.680> having<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.160> bolt<00:02:32.459> factor

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
hold factor so by having a bolt factor

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
hold factor so by having a bolt factor
it's<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.180> very

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's going to be it's going to be very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.589 
it's going to be it's going to be very
easy<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:41.130> we're<00:02:41.340> doing<00:02:41.730> right

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
easy so this is what we're doing right

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.250 
easy so this is what we're doing right
over<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.590> am<00:02:43.739> again<00:02:44.750> doing<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> notice

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
will be continuing doing this and then

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.420 
will be continuing doing this and then
how<00:03:15.870> we're<00:03:16.049> gonna<00:03:16.140> work<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.590> out<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:17.010> Chloe's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
how we're gonna work this out as Chloe's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.460 
how we're gonna work this out as Chloe's
going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> go<00:03:17.900> underneath<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.200> dryer

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
going to go underneath the dryer

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.310 
going to go underneath the dryer
actually<00:03:20.220> she's<00:03:20.670> going<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.090> air<00:03:21.780> diffused

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
actually she's going to be air diffused

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.250 
actually she's going to be air diffused
so<00:03:23.310> by<00:03:23.489> diffusing<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.090> air<00:03:24.890> we<00:03:25.890> will<00:03:26.100> be

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
so by diffusing the air we will be

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.949 
so by diffusing the air we will be
putting<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.440> for<00:03:28.590> about<00:03:28.680> 10<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.340> 15<00:03:29.519> minutes

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
once the 10-15 minutes is up we'll be

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.289 
once the 10-15 minutes is up we'll be
able<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.500> under<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.489> curl<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.880> we'll<00:03:39.180> be

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
able to under the curl and and we'll be

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.960 
able to under the curl and and we'll be
ready<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.569> set<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.890> I'm<00:03:41.370> actually<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.880> to
