triad of primaries to some newer colors
that<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.619> recently<00:00:19.830> purchased<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.910> I

painting<00:00:23.220> gain<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.910> strength<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.539> needs

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
painting gain the strength that it needs

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.779

transparent red oxide it's chroma
interactive<00:00:36.600> acrylic<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.250> then<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.309> switched

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
interactive acrylic and then I switched

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910

my yellow ochre to raw Sienna dark to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
my yellow ochre to raw Sienna dark to
get<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> better<00:00:44.309> value<00:00:44.670> range<00:00:45.180> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
get a better value range because it is a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.270 
get a better value range because it is a
darker<00:00:46.649> color

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
darker color

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.380 
darker color
overall<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.170> switched<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.440> ultramarine<00:00:50.129> blue

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
overall I switched my ultramarine blue

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.350 
overall I switched my ultramarine blue
to<00:00:51.390> Prussian<00:00:51.930> blue<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.550> felt<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to Prussian blue I just felt like I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
to Prussian blue I just felt like I
wanted<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.780> little<00:00:55.789> truer<00:00:56.789> blue<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:58.770> leans<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
wanted a little truer blue this leans a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
wanted a little truer blue this leans a
little<00:00:59.340> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> green<00:01:00.690> sort<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
little to the green sort of like a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
little to the green sort of like a
cerulean<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.180> dark<00:01:03.539> when

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
cerulean but it's very very dark when

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.750 
cerulean but it's very very dark when
you<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.229> mix<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.680> white<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> really

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you don't mix it with white so it really

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.890 
you don't mix it with white so it really
provides<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.689> dark<00:01:07.560> oomph<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:09.450> have

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
provides a good dark oomph and I have

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.219 
provides a good dark oomph and I have
olive<00:01:10.350> green<00:01:10.880> just<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> convenience<00:01:12.659> color<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
olive green just a convenience color so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
olive green just a convenience color so
that<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> mixing

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
how that translates into the painting so

what<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> been<00:01:59.009> doing<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.520> my<00:01:59.670> painting

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
what have I been doing in my painting

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899 
what have I been doing in my painting
well<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.310> decided<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
well a lot for one thing I decided that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.420 
well a lot for one thing I decided that
the<00:02:03.390> ground<00:02:03.659> plane<00:02:04.079> needed<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> lot

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the ground plane needed to be a lot

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
the ground plane needed to be a lot
darker<00:02:05.939> than<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.530> give<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.950> painting

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
darker than it was to give this painting

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.920 
darker than it was to give this painting
the<00:02:09.860> strength<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.400> needed<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.540> been

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the strength that it needed so I've been

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.880 
the strength that it needed so I've been
darkening<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> grain

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
darkening the grain

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.960 
darkening the grain
plain<00:02:14.340> I've<00:02:14.700> been<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.300> working<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:16.350> my<00:02:16.970> you

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
plain I've been just working with my you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.000 
plain I've been just working with my you
know<00:02:18.000> cheap<00:02:18.450> hardware<00:02:18.990> store<00:02:19.350> brushes<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
know cheap hardware store brushes you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.090 
know cheap hardware store brushes you
can<00:02:20.160> see<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> whole<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.960> whole<00:02:22.290> supply<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
can see I have a whole a whole supply of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.670 
can see I have a whole a whole supply of
them<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.510> I've<00:02:24.930> also<00:02:25.110> been<00:02:25.410> doing<00:02:25.530> some

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
them there so I've also been doing some

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
them there so I've also been doing some
scruffy<00:02:26.370> toe<00:02:26.580> techniques<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.870> that

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
scruffy toe techniques you can see that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.890 
scruffy toe techniques you can see that
down<00:02:28.350> here<00:02:28.890> less<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:30.090> with<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.810> of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
down here less is more with this kind of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
down here less is more with this kind of
thing<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> specialized

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
thing when you use a specialized

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
thing when you use a specialized
technique<00:02:33.030> or<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.450> use<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> special<00:02:34.230> brush

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
technique or you use a special brush

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.910 
technique or you use a special brush
like<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> fan<00:02:35.280> brush<00:02:35.720> less<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.930> more<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.440> really

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
like a fan brush less is more you really

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.040 
like a fan brush less is more you really
want<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.610> use<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.120> technique<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.570> best

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
want to use the technique to best

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.449 
want to use the technique to best
advantage<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.070> not<00:02:41.730> overdo<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.860> easy<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
advantage and not overdo it it's easy to

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.160 
advantage and not overdo it it's easy to
get<00:02:44.610> carried<00:02:44.820> away<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
get carried away when you have a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.870 
get carried away when you have a
technique<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.740> you're<00:02:47.040> liking<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.730> that's

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
technique that you're liking and that's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.760 
technique that you're liking and that's
giving<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> result<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.170> want<00:02:49.410> to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
giving you the result that you want to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.350 
giving you the result that you want to
you<00:02:49.920> know<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> works<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.790> area<00:02:51.030> then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you know if it works in this area then

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.550 
you know if it works in this area then
you're<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.600> oh<00:02:51.630> let's<00:02:51.959> put<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.200> here<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
you're like oh let's put it here and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.360 
you're like oh let's put it here and
here<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.640> gets<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.060> too<00:02:54.180> much

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
here and here and it gets to be too much

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.370 
here and here and it gets to be too much
so<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> use<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.360> advantage<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.050> I've<00:02:58.170> done

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
so to use it to advantage what I've done

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.610 
so to use it to advantage what I've done
is<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.790> scratched<00:03:00.480> back<00:03:00.930> where<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
is I have just scratched back where the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.130 
is I have just scratched back where the
light<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:01.980> hitting<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.270> see<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.660> it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
light is hitting you can see that it's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.830 
light is hitting you can see that it's
dark<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.070> shadow<00:03:05.400> there's<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.450> cloud

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
dark here in shadow there's a cloud

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.490 
dark here in shadow there's a cloud
shadow<00:03:07.170> over<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.680> marsh<00:03:08.180> here<00:03:09.320> right<00:03:10.320> it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
shadow over the marsh here right it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.650 
shadow over the marsh here right it's
darker<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.790> light<00:03:12.030> starts<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
darker but there's the light starts to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.990 
darker but there's the light starts to
rake<00:03:12.870> across<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.890> where<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> lighter<00:03:14.520> color

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
rake across and where the lighter color

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.870 
rake across and where the lighter color
is<00:03:15.500> that's<00:03:16.500> where<00:03:16.860> I've<00:03:17.010> scratched<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
is that's where I've scratched in and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.340 
is that's where I've scratched in and
flecked<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.450> some<00:03:19.070> individual<00:03:21.080> blades<00:03:22.080> of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
flecked out some individual blades of

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.670 
flecked out some individual blades of
grass<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:24.269> I've<00:03:24.450> used<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.620> to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
grass and so I've used that you know to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.039 
grass and so I've used that you know to
pretty<00:03:26.010> good<00:03:26.220> advantage<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:27.060> emphasize<00:03:27.660> where

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
pretty good advantage to emphasize where

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.320 
pretty good advantage to emphasize where
the<00:03:28.230> light<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.610> can<00:03:29.790> see<00:03:29.820> right<00:03:30.180> in

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
the light is so you can see right in

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.220 
the light is so you can see right in
this<00:03:30.420> area<00:03:31.160> where<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.610> now<00:03:33.360> problems<00:03:34.080> in

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
this area where that is now problems in

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.900 
this area where that is now problems in
this<00:03:34.350> painting<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.799> remained<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> sky<00:03:35.850> is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
this painting that remained the sky is

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
this painting that remained the sky is
really<00:03:36.810> not<00:03:37.350> what<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> want<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.100> be<00:03:38.930> color

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
really not what I want it to be color

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.100 
really not what I want it to be color
wise<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.830> might<00:03:41.070> be<00:03:41.100> okay<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.570> needs<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
wise I think it might be okay it needs a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.320 
wise I think it might be okay it needs a
little<00:03:43.230> bit<00:03:43.350> more<00:03:43.500> drama<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.580> large<00:03:44.910> part

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
little bit more drama it's a large part

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.390 
little bit more drama it's a large part
of<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> painting<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.110> though<00:03:46.860> there's<00:03:47.130> nice

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of the painting and though there's nice

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.780 
of the painting and though there's nice
surface<00:03:48.390> texture<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.500> scumbling<00:03:50.100> going<00:03:50.640> on

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
surface texture and scumbling going on

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.229 
surface texture and scumbling going on
which<00:03:51.209> perhaps<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.930> can<00:03:52.140> see<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:53.090> think<00:03:54.090> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
which perhaps you can see I think the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.880 
which perhaps you can see I think the
sky<00:03:54.590> does<00:03:55.590> not<00:03:55.830> have<00:03:56.190> enough<00:03:57.500> activity<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.680> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
sky does not have enough activity in it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.430 
sky does not have enough activity in it
value<00:03:59.820> change<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.590> really<00:04:02.010> support

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
value change in it to really support

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.020 
value change in it to really support
what's<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.799> on<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.190> ground<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.670> while

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
what's going on on the ground and while

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.400 
what's going on on the ground and while
there's<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.299> lot<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.540> texture<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.140> ground

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
there's a lot of texture on the ground

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.900 
there's a lot of texture on the ground
it<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.920> not<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.730> big<00:04:09.120> bold<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:10.200> sort<00:04:10.650> of

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
it is not a big bold it's sort of

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.860 
it is not a big bold it's sort of
smaller<00:04:12.320> texture<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.630> sky

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
smaller texture and so I think the sky

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.650 
smaller texture and so I think the sky
does<00:04:16.140> not<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.590> support<00:04:16.890> well<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:18.450> whole

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
does not really support well the whole

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.780 
does not really support well the whole
painting<00:04:19.109> yet<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.590> also<00:04:19.979> think<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.489> even

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
painting yet I also think that even

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.360 
painting yet I also think that even
though<00:04:21.090> these<00:04:21.239> are<00:04:21.299> soft<00:04:21.810> edges<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.740> there's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
though these are soft edges here there's

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.300 
though these are soft edges here there's
too<00:04:23.789> much<00:04:24.500> these<00:04:25.500> are<00:04:25.620> soft<00:04:25.890> edges<00:04:26.190> they're

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
too much these are soft edges they're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.590 
too much these are soft edges they're
not<00:04:26.460> hard<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:26.789> can<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.270> how

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
not hard you can see how

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.260 
not hard you can see how
there<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.800> know<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:29.040> paint<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.460> melding

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
there you know that paint is melding

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.570 
there you know that paint is melding
into<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.690> sky<00:04:30.960> but<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.350> still<00:04:31.830> think<00:04:32.280> that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
into the sky but I still think that

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.820 
into the sky but I still think that
they're<00:04:33.570> too<00:04:33.840> hard<00:04:34.490> there's<00:04:35.490> too<00:04:35.790> much<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.390> a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
they're too hard there's too much of a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.470 
they're too hard there's too much of a
severe<00:04:37.830> break<00:04:38.130> between<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.610> distant<00:04:39.270> Hill

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
severe break between the distant Hill

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.830 
severe break between the distant Hill
line<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.680> sky<00:04:40.980> so<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.370> sky<00:04:41.850> needs<00:04:42.180> work<00:04:42.630> I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
line and the sky so the sky needs work I

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.120 
line and the sky so the sky needs work I
don't<00:04:42.930> know<00:04:43.080> what<00:04:43.260> I'm<00:04:43.350> gonna<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.710> up<00:04:43.890> there

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
don't know what I'm gonna do up there

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.820 
don't know what I'm gonna do up there
yet<00:04:44.400> I'm<00:04:44.720> pondering<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.230> do<00:04:46.290> know<00:04:46.650> that

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
yet I'm pondering it and I do know that

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.610 
yet I'm pondering it and I do know that
the<00:04:47.480> distant<00:04:48.480> Hills<00:04:48.720> need<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.050> fade<00:04:49.320> away<00:04:49.590> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the distant Hills need to fade away a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.010 
the distant Hills need to fade away a
little<00:04:49.860> bit<00:04:49.980> more<00:04:50.340> into<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.670> distance<00:04:51.030> so

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
little bit more into the distance so

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.440 
little bit more into the distance so
that's<00:04:52.170> where<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.500> am<00:04:52.560> new<00:04:53.070> colors<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.910> using

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
that's where I am new colors on using

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.510 
that's where I am new colors on using
the<00:04:54.540> scruffy<00:04:54.990> toe<00:04:55.170> teak<00:04:55.440> technique<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
the scruffy toe teak technique in a

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.090 
the scruffy toe teak technique in a
limited<00:04:56.850> way<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.690> advantage<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.500> I'm

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
limited way to advantage and I'm

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.400 
limited way to advantage and I'm
pondering<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.730> sky<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.270> stay<00:05:00.750> with<00:05:00.960> me<00:05:01.170> you'll

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
pondering the sky so stay with me you'll

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.960 
pondering the sky so stay with me you'll
see<00:05:01.470> more<00:05:01.860> changes<00:05:02.340> coming<00:05:02.580> up
