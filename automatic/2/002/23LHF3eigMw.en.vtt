00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.899
 seriously 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.910
 I have one year of contract left between them 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
 first four years ends in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 December next year but now 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 but I would love beyond taking 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.840
 I would love to make a classification a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.840
 year flies by 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 adventure something for a party 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.620
 ratito goes to 20 30 today Tuesday 11 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 play chile with bolivia when i think 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 that has to express a difference 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 minimum of three goals against Bolivia 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 how until when Chile because Bolivia 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.219
 that clearly I would say it is a team 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.100
 that has suffered an involution 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 football beyond that is penultimate 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 in the table positions vÃ³ley 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.649
 far the worst team of a very team 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 young yes but it's the worst team the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 qualifiers maybe it's going to cost going to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 cost to open the account because 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.110
 comes with surely with two lines of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.110
 four letters but once 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.290
 nice party influences both the public 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 the result as before 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.980
 I think they imply I think that they affect 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.930
 other more determining factors 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.240
 work with discipline do well 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.830
 things the best times 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.200
 footballingly speaking you can score 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.430
 difference because many times it arrives and you 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.390
 create and opportunities and do not brand 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.930
 indifference at that time 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.060
 I do not know if we look at it as they said the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.530
 Uruguayan players that there is a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 very nice story and the year is 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.040
 that silenced maracana and went to win 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.840
 to to win own rules varela and 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.220
 others more intelligent content 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.750
 Uruguay out if you please 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.640
 I ask a favor Uruguayans tell me not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.470
 make a fool of yourself and there mariela and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.030
 others say the outsiders were 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.229
 200,000 people are from sticks 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.500
 they play us this morning just like me 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.539
 but they could not be 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.219
 we can not we have had no 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 We can not not, that's why I told you not to 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.399
 they could do the last 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.899
 qualifiers the stadiums and I've 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.819
 done on the cable I want many things 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.690
 of football but I like life 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 challenges but not
