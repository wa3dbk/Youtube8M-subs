instance this is halo 4 there's four
letters<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.380> word<00:02:20.530> halo<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.490> add

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
letters in the word halo and if we add

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.270 
letters in the word halo and if we add
that<00:02:21.940> force<00:02:22.270> at<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> 4<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.110> halo<00:02:23.320> 4<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:24.130> can

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that force at the 4 and halo 4 we can

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.190 
that force at the 4 and halo 4 we can
eight<00:02:24.460> now<00:02:25.030> there<00:02:25.510> are<00:02:25.600> three<00:02:25.630> other<00:02:26.020> ale

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
eight now there are three other ale

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.110 
eight now there are three other ale
games<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.130> three<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.640> eighth<00:02:27.820> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
games at that three to the eighth and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.690 
games at that three to the eighth and
that<00:02:28.420> makes<00:02:28.600> 11<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.680> eleventh<00:02:30.220> month<00:02:30.280> of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that makes 11 and the eleventh month of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.680 
that makes 11 and the eleventh month of
the<00:02:30.820> year<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:32.460> November<00:02:33.460> ah<00:02:33.670> there<00:02:34.360> were<00:02:34.480> more

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the year is November ah there were more

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.330 
the year is November ah there were more
than<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.930> three<00:02:35.260> games<00:02:35.470> don't<00:02:36.010> mess<00:02:36.130> me<00:02:36.310> up

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
than just three games don't mess me up

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.100 
than just three games don't mess me up
oh<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:37.000> I'd<00:02:37.450> hate<00:02:37.660> for<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.960> get

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
oh right I'd hate for this to get

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.860 
oh right I'd hate for this to get
confusing<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.670> all<00:02:39.820> know<00:02:40.090> if<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.690> take

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
confusing now as we all know if we take

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
confusing now as we all know if we take
11<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.470> subtract<00:02:41.830> five<00:02:42.070> from<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.460> we<00:02:42.580> get<00:02:42.760> six

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
11 and subtract five from it we get six

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.960 
11 and subtract five from it we get six
that's<00:02:43.750> how<00:02:44.020> we'll<00:02:44.230> remember<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.710> day

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that's how we'll remember the day

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.550 
that's how we'll remember the day
november<00:02:45.970> six<00:02:46.000> wait<00:02:46.660> why<00:02:46.990> did<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.200> subtract

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
november six wait why did you subtract

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.980 
november six wait why did you subtract
five<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.490> halo<00:02:48.820> 4<00:02:49.090> which<00:02:49.810> is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
five because this is halo 4 which is

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.010 
five because this is halo 4 which is
what's<00:02:50.260> less<00:02:50.620> than<00:02:50.860> 5<00:02:51.100> 11<00:02:52.030> less<00:02:52.210> five<00:02:52.510> or<00:02:52.720> six

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
what's less than 5 11 less five or six

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.160 
what's less than 5 11 less five or six
come<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.590> seven<00:02:54.040> keep<00:02:54.250> up<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.610> think<00:02:54.940> my<00:02:55.210> brain

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
come on seven keep up I think my brain

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.900 
come on seven keep up I think my brain
just<00:02:56.200> broke<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.980> course<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> calculate<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
just broke of course to calculate the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.540 
just broke of course to calculate the
air<00:02:58.210> we<00:02:58.390> simply<00:02:58.690> multiply<00:02:58.840> 11<00:02:59.500> times<00:02:59.740> sex<00:03:00.070> to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
air we simply multiply 11 times sex to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.660 
air we simply multiply 11 times sex to
give<00:03:00.670> us<00:03:00.820> 66<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.710> 66<00:03:02.710> is<00:03:02.980> made<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.400> two

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
give us 66 and 66 is made up of two

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.910 
give us 66 and 66 is made up of two
sixes<00:03:04.330> 2<00:03:04.990> times<00:03:05.290> 6<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.710> 12<00:03:05.920> 50<00:03:06.750> he<00:03:07.750> got<00:03:07.900> 2012<00:03:08.440> why
