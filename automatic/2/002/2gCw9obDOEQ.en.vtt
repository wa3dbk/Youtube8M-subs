00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.689
 free I'm using right now 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.119
 and others but I did not put them all for 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.670
 do not slow down the pc but I know 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.279
 and let all that and you look at them 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.460
 like the link will be in the description 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.120
 of the video I leave these two options and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.969
 you download it from wherever you want 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.180
 Once downloaded we extract the file 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.180
 run 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.460
 here I will be leaving the free ones in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 white version 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.710
 I'll also be leaving the three of you and it's 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.710
 that I use more than these are 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.110
 and finally the transparent ones 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.670
 to install any double gas 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.070
 click and install and it will appear in the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.050
 desk 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.050
 I will tell you the utility of each one 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.710
 This shows you how much you are using 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.990
 ram cpu hard disks the signal of the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 landscape and the things that you have deleted 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.820
 This also shows you how much you are 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.820
 using your ram memory cpu 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.740
 this the earth is avoidable and I will leave it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.600
 for the end 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.600
 this is to turn off or restart 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.860
 This shows you the temperature of your 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.950
 city already of a title with figures to your 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 taste 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.649
 This is the calendar and it tells you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.770
 how many air things in the bin of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.770
 recycling 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.170

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.910

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.190
 font and color 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.700
