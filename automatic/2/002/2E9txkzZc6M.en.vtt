00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
 there is also a very nice theory question it is not foggy 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.389
 so in the fog 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.400
 I am of course there are a few the theory rules 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 and when can you still use some rear fog light 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.729
 the image is few years and yes if it get the view and parties 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.000
 neither can what was in it 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 the big ones because they color rear fog light 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.559
 he says yes that is correct 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.600
 very many people in the country these students say this 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.300
 that said the case and that is a signal that I definitely got last year 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 but fog is also an option again 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.440
 So red is nice yes yes he can also be in the city when it rains 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.360
 I think 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.470
 because other reflectors may work that bright lamp 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 he and how many meters worry 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.190
 the chain 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 Intel booked so there it is normally then outside comes out 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.030
 the hectometre post sof reflector posts packages with state to go with 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.810
 stand that 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 that you have the facts 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.850
 one has a better one 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.770
 100 meter 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 so for breakfast and in between reflector posts always stand 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 in which the reflector place nothing has changed he refers to working out 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.050
 the bad pass from the right side was colored 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.150
 that keeps 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 back and the left 2 and why is that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 aj auxerre m 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.909
 because b 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.570
 there are already not going near 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.630
 right 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 and what is going to make 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.720
 Alps 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.110
 just think about it is really just the rear lights of the car with a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 scythe rode on the right 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.900
 yes in the law state israel came back slightly to one of the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.880
 cars 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 and the left 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.260
 it is white with its the mind of dance the headlights so can your team 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.690
 every okay 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.890
 PSV is located 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.449
 when can you use that 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.659
 I always have it when it is 50 meters free 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.489
 next to front lights yes 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.709
 that the players are within 200 meters 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.200
 and otherwise it should not be obvious then you will also get a couple too 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.349
 feed 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.809
 how can you do you now led great light with manure 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:26.720
 the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.779
 3 that 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.709
 Yes, exactly 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.679
 may you have great light during the day anyway 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.969
 Only 3 supermarkets 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.239
 when can you put that for a big one 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.170
 if it is dark in the evening and looks but then you have to face Heerenveen 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.339
 I am very, very, very accurate 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.819
 a few questions were taken 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.389
 And anyway you are going to have a nice theory exam tomorrow but still learn well 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.139
 lend from each other also get on success thank you
