 that are the things that we do wrong and 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.130
 since then we repented and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.130
 we try never to do it again 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.899

 Strengthens the gift of the Holy Spirit

 bread and wine as a symbol of the body and 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.709
 the blood of Jesus and so we remember him and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.900
 we have him in mind and we live like him 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.409
 he taught us by calling each other 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.409

 woman decide to join forever before 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.290
 Christian family 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.940

 They want to dedicate his life to teaching 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.870
 life of jesus and for which god gives them 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.000
 the power to forgive sins and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.320
