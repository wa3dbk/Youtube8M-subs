00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.400
In California, a ways East of the Pacific
Coast are the remains of a town once called

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400
Mariposa. There's a military base outside
the town - little more than a hole in the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.180
ground these days but it has played a pivotal
role in the wasteland's destiny time and time

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.520
again.
I know most of you were born there. Or re-born.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.840
But Marcus tells me that some of you are having
trouble remembering things, and can't always

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.300
figure out what's real and what's not, so
I'm here to give you all a refresher course in mutant history.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.920
Haha! You talk a lot! Sound funny when you talk,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.899
like a stupid human. Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.899
Yes, as I was saying…

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.850
When I visited the Mariposa base a few years
ago, there was little more than the bones

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.880
of a few dead Super Mutants, deformed rats,
and the skeleton of some old dog lying next

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.340
to a broken down force field generator, but
deeper down, much deeper, I saw firsthand

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.700
the secrets that spawned both the Super Mutants
and the Brotherhood of Steel.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.750
Back before the Great War the facility was
used to experiment with the Forced Evolutionary

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.630
Virus. The big vats are destroyed now, but
you can still find some of it deep below the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.240
ground. Long before the Master came, the FEV
was created by the United States government

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.320
in an attempt to generate useful mutations.
The government used its own citizens as guinea

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.170
pigs; prisoners and Commie sympathizers - but
Americans nonetheless.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.930
Captain Roger Maxson, the founder of the Brotherhood
was stationed there before the war, a simple

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.920
soldier in the security detail. But when men
under his command found out what the scientists

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.790
were doing to his comrades-in-arms, they rebelled,
and Maxson soon became their leader. Eventually,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.610
they became the first members of the Brotherhood
of Steel. When the nuclear holocaust took

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.550
place a few days later, Maxson led his soldiers
and their families out into the wasteland,

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.760
leaving the Mariposa base behind. They sealed
the place up as best they could, and activated

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.300
automated security measures, but with no one
on hand to maintain it all, eventually people

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.370
and critters made their way inside.
The pre-War scientists never quite succeeded

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.370
with their experiments. It took a more - advanced
mind to control the effects of FEV mutation.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.400
Decades after the Great War, the future Master
fell into those vats, and when he emerged

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.489
he picked up where they left off, experimented,
and eventually created most of you. Then the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.449
Vault Dweller located the place, and-

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.060
I'm so sorry!

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.609
But that was a long time ago, and the Vault
Dweller is long dead.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.660
Ha ha ha! Yes! Too fun.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.300
Most people never knew of the base's existence

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.489
in the years afterwards, but the Enclave had
the resources to locate the origins of the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.489
FEV, and they went to Mariposa to secure a
sample for their own devious purposes. The

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.720
Enclave kept their soldiers and scientists
protected from the FEV, but their slave laborers,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.250
miners kidnapped from the town of Redding
to excavate the lower levels, had no such

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.680
protection from the goo that survived the
decades.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.200
Slowly, those poor workers began to mutate.
Sadly, that second generation of super mutants

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.810
didn't have the Master guiding their transformation.
He had carefully chosen his subjects before

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.330
dipping them, but this second generation was
composed of anyone unfortunate enough to be

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.580
pressed into the Enclave's service.
The results were... mixed. The second generation

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.239
was as big, sometimes even bigger, but much
less intelligent. That's why some Super Mutants

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.999
in New California can get along with humans,
while others are-

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.080
ARRRRRGH!

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.020
In fact, some of the original Super Mutants

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.130
even call the second generation “Dumb Dumbs”.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.070
Ha ha ha ha. Stupid robot. Ha ha ha.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.870
But a few of this new batch ended up developing
abilities that would have made The Master proud.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.040
Silly robot. Ha ha ha.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.520
When the Chosen One was searching for
the Enclave's headquarters 40 years ago, they

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.190
stumbled across the Mariposa base, and discovered
some second generation mutants still trapped

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.680
inside after the Enclave blasted the entrance.
The Chosen One fought a mutant named Melchior

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.710
who could summon creatures out of the FEV
goo, just like a magician pulling rabbits

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.640
out of a glowing green hat.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.139
At least that's what the Chosen One claimed.
No one back then was keen on inspecting the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.190
place first hand to verify a story about magical
deathclaws. Only person who seemed to care

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.710
what happened to the miners from Redding was
Melchior's son, Junior. He was just a tyke

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.550
when his dad disappeared. If he's still alive,
he'd be middle-aged about now. Maybe still

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:37.180
wandering the wasteland looking for his dad.
Since then, Marcus has done his best to give

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.039
some of you a home. Among the mutants, every
person is their own unique being – a species

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.639
of one. That kind of genetic diversity is
a blessing; there are places in the wasteland

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.479
where the opposite is true. Dozens of identical
men caged together, consumed by a murderous

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.820
rage against all outsiders.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.640
But that- is a story for another day...
