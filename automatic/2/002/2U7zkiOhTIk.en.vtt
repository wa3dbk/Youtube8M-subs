00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello welcome to the board 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.139
 Let's now resolve an exercise on 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.010
 multiplication and division into 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 then consider two 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.830
 complex numbers in their forms 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:33.040
 trigonometric z1 equal to pomegranate times with 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:36.910
 being detected more and times being held 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.620
 1 where with one is the module of being a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 eternal to 1 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:53.320
 is the argument to say z2 equal to 2 times 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 cosine detects two more and sometimes 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 of theta two then only here z 11 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:14.820
 times and two equals 80 times ocean 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:21.370
 of 160 degrees but not 160 degrees 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:27.640
 and that z 2 / g 1 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:34.390
 is equal to five greens with being 40 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:39.490
 degrees but times and not at 40 degrees 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 we want to find values ​​of theft 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.240
 then roh2 eta 2 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.650
 So let's start finding the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 roaming values and roh2 remembering that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.620
 in the multiplication of two numbers 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.040
 complexes 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.170
 The resulting module is equal to 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.870
 multiplication of modules 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:08.319
 we have to with 11 times the 2 is the same 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.539
 to the module of that number 01 times and 2 that 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 in this case it is 80 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.030
 already the division the resulting mode is equal to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.860
 division of modules 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.960
 so we have to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.300
 ro 2 divided the course is equal to the module 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.300
 of this number which is 5 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.690
 we will solve this system by dividing 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:38.130
 equation from top to bottom then 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:43.360
 this will result that with 11 times the 2 / 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:47.580
 roh2 on with one but split a thing 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.590
 / other is the same as multiplying 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:58.090
 we go up here as a 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.310
 this equals 80/5 simplifying nodes 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 Let's cancel or two like 2 and stay 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:11.980
 with a square is equal to 80/5 that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.140
 Give it 16 then okay, we'll come to the conclusion. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 that rome could be more or less root 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 out of 16 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.959
 however the number module will never 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.650
 can be negative 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.110
 then this negative value is not valid and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 we came to the conclusion that roh moon is 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.060
 equal to more 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 queen of 16 who is equal to four 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.630
 so we can find the 2 replacing 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.900
 value of such as an equation 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:51.160
 we will have to with one that is four 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:55.870
 times two equals 80 then rolled two is 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.390
 equal to 80/4 is equal to 20 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.250
 then we find the values ​​of how 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.720
 which is 4 and roh2 which is 20 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.010
 now we will find the values of 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.049
 earth one and roof 21 the first equation 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.200
 we have the multiplication of two 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.810
 complex numbers and we remember that 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.019
 When we multiply two numbers the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.130
 result has as an argument the sum 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.979
 two arguments 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:30.760
 so it's so much more ceiling two equals 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.810
 argument of this multiplication which is 160 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.410
 degrees 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.050
 already in the division of two complex numbers 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.520
 the resulting argument is equal to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.990
 difference between the numerator argument 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.030
 and a denominator 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:52.860
 so here we come to the conclusion that 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:56.740
 up to 2 - try one is equal to argument 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.110
 resulting from that division being 40 degrees 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.050
 so here we have a system of 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.100
 better with two unknowns and two 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.090
 equations 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.690
 if we add the two equations we 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.840
 we will come to the conclusion that the ceiling is 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.030
 one of the top will cancel contemplates one of 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.169
 low in the sum because it is a positive and 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.540
 other negative 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.240
 then it will disappear and we will have a 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:28.600
 ceiling to 2 up but delta 2 to bottom 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:38.620
 that will give 2 tries two is equal to 160 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:44.770
 plus 40 that gives 200 degrees as soon as eta 2 is 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:47.500
 equal than 200/2 which is 100 degrees 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:53.440
 now we see in the first action that 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:59.530
 The theta plus two theta is equal to 162 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:03.639
 they were worth so it's got to be worth 60 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.350
 degrees for them to try but try 2 be 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.200
 equal to 160 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.320
 then we find all the variables that 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.900
 we wanted to meet and we can go out 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:22.780
 writing now z1 z 2 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:29.110
 so let's try z1 just like pomegranate 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:39.460
 worth four times the sensing and is so 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:45.650
 legal 60 but and times being 62 is the same 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:54.500
 to street 2 that costs 20 times 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:55.610
 2 is so but times and yes the 100 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.410
 degrees 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.410
 This is it, everybody, I hug.
