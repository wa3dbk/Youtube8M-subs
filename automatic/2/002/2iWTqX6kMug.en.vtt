00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
can do it on just go but the only

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.830 
can do it on just go but the only
problem<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.239> you've<00:03:31.420> got<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.600> high

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
problem is is you've got a high

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.830 
problem is is you've got a high
possibility<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.830> dying<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.600> great

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
possibility of dying it's not a great

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.930 
possibility of dying it's not a great
idea<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.860> lot<00:03:36.130> easier<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.700> do<00:03:36.820> an

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
idea and it's a lot easier to do an

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.560 
idea and it's a lot easier to do an
invitation<00:03:37.840> only<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.950> now<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.430> will<00:03:39.570> actually

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
invitation only so now I will actually

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.810

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
but then go playstation store and you

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.570 
but then go playstation store and you
can<00:05:38.970> do<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.710> good<00:05:40.890> thing<00:05:40.919> is<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.460> you're

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
can do this the good thing is is you're

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.040 
can do this the good thing is is you're
not<00:05:41.700> actually<00:05:41.940> selling<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.540> car<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:43.020> you

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
not actually selling the car so you

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.490 
not actually selling the car so you
don't<00:05:43.229> have<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.680> redo<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:44.190> but<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:45.300> try<00:05:45.660> last

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
don't have to redo it but just try last

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560 
don't have to redo it but just try last
time<00:05:46.740> we<00:05:46.830> did<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:46.979> work<00:05:47.400> done<00:05:47.610> second<00:05:48.150> time<00:05:48.300> so

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
time we did it work done second time so

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.200 
time we did it work done second time so
hopefully<00:05:48.750> it<00:05:49.020> will<00:05:49.110> work<00:05:49.169> this<00:05:49.500> time<00:05:49.770> but<00:05:50.460> it

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
hopefully it will work this time but it

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.090 
hopefully it will work this time but it
usually<00:05:51.390> works<00:05:51.780> on<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.050> first<00:05:52.350> or<00:05:52.650> second

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100
