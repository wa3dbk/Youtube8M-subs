 because they correct me to take but good 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.690
 if we say in my ranch 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.290
 we are going to add the 2 blanquillos and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.040
 we're going to add 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 is the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.850
 in mind 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.180
 there are the blanquillos 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.180
 that in silk 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.950
 in the cee this is the oil of oil 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.950
 almond 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.950
 and we add enough depends what 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.950
 long you have the hair 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.950
 and we will also add water 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.480
 Y 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.860
 we are going to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.260
 to let it settle that it becomes 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.060
 in red while normal 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 do we part our hair 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.400
 how to shake the wastelands hair 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.569
 unravels as we do with any 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.380
 another dye let's let this one 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.380
 enough 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.870
 not that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.640
 according to clog 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.640
 Swedish a clean 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.460
 good and this has to be cleaned fast 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.900
 because if the colors remain 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:43.400
 well, it remained green, but still 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.709
 I just determined it curdles a lot 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.510
 but the more adding water that stays like that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:57.069
 as 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:59.720
 as this has been very much sought liquid 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.329
 good and I'll wait for it to go 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.010
 red like mÃ¼ller 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:14.900
 and good for the color to turn red 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.090
 the coffee is good and while I 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.970
 I'm going to separate the hair and give it to me 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.410
 well it stops the hair and put it in 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.650
 sections like when we painted the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.180
 hair with regular paint ladies who 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.370
 this one is going to have chemicals for 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.080
 not harm my baby well I think it's already 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.080
 put red 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.800
 and here is 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.800
 it does not stir very well but 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.490
 well ok then I was already ready 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.710
 Now I'm going to put on gloves because if 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.390
 not the painting will remain in my hand as 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.639
 the three days I think 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.669
 and I'm going to leave it 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.330
 Yaya time for even two that are 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:15.189
 like nine in the morning 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.289
 the more you leave it darker 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.689
 will remain 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.139
 and especially if we want to cover 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.139
 roads 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.620
 well now yes to clean because it gets 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.849
 a lot of scum 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.240
 clean 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.270
 You can leave the hours you want 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.270
 cover yourself with 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:47.760
 ya buscats not to wet your hair 

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:50.250
 when you do not bathe this 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.130
 so that you do not begin to resect 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.960
 so much and also remember that because you 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.380
 you add that water so it's going to 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.380
 be running 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.530
 so I'm going to put one of these and now 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.890
 yes while collecting the paint is going to be 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.890
 his work
