 Welcome to the Tuesday classroom, my friend! 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.920
 Nice to meet you, I am Leonardo Pereznieto. 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.820
 Today we will draw a very simple picture 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.980
 a sailboat on the sea 

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:25.295
 First depicting masts and sails 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.140
 Then the bottom of the hull 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 And a few sailors 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 Painted with color because you can only see one silhouette 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.540
 Draw a reflection through some loose lines 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 I like to paint reflections, it is very interesting. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560
 Sketching this step, it looks good. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.500
 Continue to paint the shadows of the sea waves, 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 Also draw some simple clouds 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.100
 With white crayon, you can draw some great reflections 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.040
 Of course, as long as you are not using white paper 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.460
 This paper is grayish 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.760
 This looks a bit light, we draw him a bit 

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:24.101
 You can apply it with one side of the tip to make it look more even 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.640
 Draw the shadow of the waves a little deeper and polish it a little. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.640
 Spread evenly 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.400
 Draw it! Tell me what do you think? 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.660
