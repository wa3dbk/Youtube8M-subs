00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
we'll start the walk through right here

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.189 
we'll start the walk through right here
so<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> fish<00:00:17.250> tank<00:00:17.520> swear<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> fish<00:00:18.539> eat<00:00:18.779> and

so the fish tank swear the fish eat and
poo<00:00:19.460> dude<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:21.109> because<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> swirl

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
poo dude I thing because of the swirl

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.330 
poo dude I thing because of the swirl
filter<00:00:22.920> where<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> water<00:00:24.560> spins<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
filter where the water spins and the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.509 
filter where the water spins and the
heavier<00:00:26.910> solids<00:00:27.420> fall<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> bottom<00:00:28.519> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
heavier solids fall out to the bottom so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.179 
heavier solids fall out to the bottom so
this<00:00:29.730> drain<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.199> controls<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> level

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this drain right here controls the level

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.720 
this drain right here controls the level
of<00:00:32.309> both<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> these<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.620> fiber<00:00:34.890> running<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of both of these so fiber running out of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.850 
of both of these so fiber running out of
water<00:00:35.940> i<00:00:36.120> need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.540> add<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.320> bit<00:00:37.590> more<00:00:37.829> i

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
water i need to add a little bit more i

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
water i need to add a little bit more i
can<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.219> twist<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> drain<00:00:39.030> that'll<00:00:39.360> give

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can just twist that drain that'll give

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.330 
can just twist that drain that'll give
me<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.870> lot<00:00:40.530> more<00:00:40.770> water<00:00:41.070> than<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.760> sump<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:44.309> i

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
me a lot more water than my sump but i

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740 
me a lot more water than my sump but i
don't<00:00:44.550> need<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
don't need to do that and get to that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
don't need to do that and get to that
from<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> next<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> particle

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
from a second so next is the particle

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
from a second so next is the particle
filter<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.379> redid<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.270> works<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
filter i redid this and it works a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
filter i redid this and it works a
little<00:00:51.600> better<00:00:52.070> doesn't<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.309> nice<00:00:53.489> but

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
little better doesn't look as nice but

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
little better doesn't look as nice but
it's<00:00:54.300> more<00:00:54.539> practical<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.230> i<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> pull

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's more practical because i can pull

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's more practical because i can pull
out<00:00:55.890> individual<00:00:56.610> filter<00:00:57.059> pads<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.629> rinse

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
out individual filter pads and rinse

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
out individual filter pads and rinse
them<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:01.820> from<00:01:02.820> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
them out put them back in so from here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
them out put them back in so from here
it<00:01:03.120> goes<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> sump<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.920> i<00:01:05.070> ever<00:01:05.129> need

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it goes in the sump and if i ever need

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.690 
it goes in the sump and if i ever need
to<00:01:05.630> get<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> sump<00:01:07.200> i<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.010> pull<00:01:08.549> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to get to the sump i can just pull this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.080 
to get to the sump i can just pull this
out<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.150> isn't<00:01:09.330> attached<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
out this isn't attached at all so that's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.130 
out this isn't attached at all so that's
nice<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:14.180> three<00:01:15.180> waterfalls<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.960> into

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
nice and three waterfalls going into

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
nice and three waterfalls going into
their<00:01:17.390> up<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> buckets<00:01:19.130> run<00:01:20.130> into<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
their up to the buckets run into the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
their up to the buckets run into the
grow<00:01:21.000> beds<00:01:21.560> which<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.369> i'm<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
grow beds which i think i'm going to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
grow beds which i think i'm going to
need<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> add<00:01:24.240> an<00:01:24.630> edge<00:01:24.869> down<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.409> each<00:01:25.590> grow

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
need to add an edge down into each grow

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
need to add an edge down into each grow
bed<00:01:26.159> cuz<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.360> flow<00:01:28.130> isn't<00:01:29.130> fast<00:01:29.790> enough<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.420> was

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bed cuz my flow isn't fast enough I was

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.700 
bed cuz my flow isn't fast enough I was
going<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.439> slow<00:01:31.740> flow<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.400> garden<00:01:33.710> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
going for a slow flow on this garden so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.390 
going for a slow flow on this garden so
I<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.329> need<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.600> air

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
I I need to add some air

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
I I need to add some air
or<00:01:38.970> else<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> plant<00:01:39.600> girls<00:01:40.080> will<00:01:40.410> just<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.710> too

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
or else the plant girls will just be too

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
or else the plant girls will just be too
slow<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> Tomatoes<00:01:44.490> happy<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> couple

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
slow so Tomatoes happy this is a couple

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
slow so Tomatoes happy this is a couple
months<00:01:46.530> old<00:01:46.830> plant<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.370> I've<00:01:47.460> moved<00:01:47.670> around

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
months old plant that I've moved around

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.720 
months old plant that I've moved around
from<00:01:48.060> different<00:01:48.540> gardens<00:01:49.310> root<00:01:50.310> mass<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
from different gardens root mass is

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.140 
from different gardens root mass is
exploding<00:01:52.310> probably<00:01:53.310> goes<00:01:53.490> down<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:53.970> about

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
exploding probably goes down to about

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.280 
exploding probably goes down to about
here<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:54.960> sue<00:01:55.290> them<00:01:55.410> by<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.480> so<00:01:57.480> three

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
here how to sue them by now so three

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.540 
here how to sue them by now so three
gallons<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.950> straight<00:01:59.310> roots<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.250> last

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
gallons of straight roots and the last

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.190 
gallons of straight roots and the last
part<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:04.800> auto<00:02:05.010> top<00:02:05.430> off<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.450> well

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
part is the auto top off it well

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.990 
part is the auto top off it well
this<00:02:07.440> yellow<00:02:07.770> line<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:08.100> there<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.490> attached<00:02:08.820> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this yellow line in there is attached to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.130 
this yellow line in there is attached to
a<00:02:09.090> float<00:02:09.330> valve<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> water<00:02:11.040> evaporates

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
a float valve so as the water evaporates

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.590 
a float valve so as the water evaporates
it'll<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:14.100> float<00:02:14.370> valve<00:02:14.400> will<00:02:14.730> drop<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.270> open

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it'll the float valve will drop and open

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.740 
it'll the float valve will drop and open
