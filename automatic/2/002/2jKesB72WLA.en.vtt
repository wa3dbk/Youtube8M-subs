think my favorite part of the episode
was<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:51.689> sad<00:01:51.930> cakes<00:01:52.200> vs.<00:01:52.500> mentors<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.579> was

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
was these sad cakes vs. mentors that was

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
was these sad cakes vs. mentors that was
really<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.210> cool<00:01:54.420> especially<00:01:55.380> getting<00:01:55.829> to

really really cool especially getting to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770 
really really cool especially getting to
see<00:01:56.219> how<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.490> stronger<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.270> mentors<00:01:57.630> are

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
see how much stronger the mentors are

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.459 
see how much stronger the mentors are
their<00:01:58.710> younger<00:01:59.310> counterparts<00:02:00.350> even<00:02:01.350> though

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
their younger counterparts even though

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.399 
their younger counterparts even though

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
growing as stronger and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.300 
growing as stronger and
