forgetting<00:01:56.510> that<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.470> first<00:01:57.710> rule<00:01:57.920> of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
forgetting that the first rule of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.140 
forgetting that the first rule of
swimming<00:01:59.120> is<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.750> push<00:02:00.470> just<00:02:00.590> push<00:02:00.710> Z<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.850> that

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
swimming is to push just push Z so that

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
swimming is to push just push Z so that
you<00:02:02.360> fly<00:02:02.990> down<00:02:03.200> below<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.620> surface<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:08.170> see

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
you fly down below the surface you see

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.980 
you fly down below the surface you see
here<00:02:09.759> I'm<00:02:10.759> spinning<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:12.380> want<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:13.990> do

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
here I'm spinning the we want to do

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.750 
here I'm spinning the we want to do
these<00:02:15.170> spins<00:02:15.560> there's<00:02:16.010> three<00:02:16.250> they're

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
these spins there's three they're

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.160 
these spins there's three they're
supposed<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.330> swing<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.570> lot<00:02:17.750> faster

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
supposed to make you swing a lot faster

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
so I can just keep doing them as long as

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.140 
so I can just keep doing them as long as
you<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.350> don't<00:02:21.709> screw

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.180 

and<00:02:29.150> each<00:02:29.930> time<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.560> coin<00:02:30.800> you'll<00:02:31.010> see

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
and each time you get a coin you'll see

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.350 
and each time you get a coin you'll see
their<00:02:31.430> mediator<00:02:31.880> refills<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.180> don't

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
their mediator refills so that you don't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.990 
their mediator refills so that you don't
drowned<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.500> here<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.920> do<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.550> Martina

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
