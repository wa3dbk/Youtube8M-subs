00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
medium-high and with the gas range I

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.750 
medium-high and with the gas range I
think<00:00:58.600> I<00:00:58.719> would<00:00:58.899> work<00:00:59.140> with<00:00:59.500> since<00:01:00.489> it's<00:01:00.670> an

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
think I would work with since it's an

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.380 
think I would work with since it's an
open<00:01:01.059> flame<00:01:01.239> I<00:01:01.449> would<00:01:01.600> start<00:01:01.899> at<00:01:02.140> low<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.089> low

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
open flame I would start at low at a low

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440 
open flame I would start at low at a low
flame<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:04.989> just<00:01:05.260> start<00:01:06.220> start<00:01:07.090> from<00:01:07.210> there

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
flame and just start start from there

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.060 
flame and just start start from there
and<00:01:07.479> then<00:01:07.750> if<00:01:07.869> you<00:01:08.020> think<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.350> need<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:08.890> at

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
and then if you think you need it and at

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.609 
and then if you think you need it and at
a<00:01:09.100> higher<00:01:09.280> temperature<00:01:09.310> then<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:11.409> raise<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
a higher temperature then just raise it

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.890 
a higher temperature then just raise it
a<00:01:11.830> little<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.340> want<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.580> go<00:01:12.700> above<00:01:13.240> low<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.869> a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
a little but I want to go above low on a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
the heat source obviously if it sits too

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.640 
the heat source obviously if it sits too
long<00:01:27.790> it'll<00:01:28.119> catch<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.900> fire<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.470> don't
