they<00:01:33.600> always<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.650> bus<00:01:35.009> driver<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.700> can

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
they always see a bus driver they can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
they always see a bus driver they can
see<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> fine<00:01:36.600> why<00:01:37.140> can't<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
see me it's fine why can't we have that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130 
see me it's fine why can't we have that
for<00:01:37.860> HGVs<00:01:38.369> why<00:01:38.970> can't<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.360> segregation

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for HGVs why can't we have segregation

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.540 
died too involved lorries we've had
cycle<00:02:05.790> super<00:02:06.149> highways<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.009> we've<00:02:08.340> had

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
cycle super highways but and we've had

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.699 
cycle super highways but and we've had
people<00:02:09.000> promised<00:02:09.450> money<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.929> change<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.560> our

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
infrastructure change takes time but

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.150

I<00:02:14.220> think<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.700> you'd<00:02:14.820> speak<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I think if you'd speak to all the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.240 
I think if you'd speak to all the
cyclists<00:02:15.870> who<00:02:15.960> are<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> roads<00:02:16.470> nothing

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
cyclists who are on the roads nothing

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.070 
cyclists who are on the roads nothing
really<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.700> changing<00:02:18.240> i<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> road

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
really is changing i think the road

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.420 
really is changing i think the road

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it stops happening and then then you can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
it stops happening and then then you can
say<00:02:28.260> maybe<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:29.040> been<00:02:29.400> completely

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
say maybe it's it's been completely

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.300
