00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.420
 it is 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:55.820
 inspired in the Seine 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:59.210
 you manage the common lot for 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.370
 to develop the difference is that we 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.469
 have here 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.229
 the economic cooperation organization 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.020
 and development the lord who 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.439
 come to Togo to bring us his 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.549
 expertise in strategy strategy 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.330
 Skill developpement 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.340
 this is a rat developed tools 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.350
 for European countries and who will 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.050
 apply for the first time to 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.149
 Togo 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.840
 the goal is to arrive at a better 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.060
 mesh of development policies 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.350
 economic policy and policies 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.450
 competent development of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.869
 skills that brings precisely the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.869
 development 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.090
 so this study will lead to 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.740
 developing a strategy for 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
 skills development for 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.619
 today and tomorrow and tomorrow not tomorrow 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.450
 simply a relationship to the constraints of the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.270
 today's market but on the long 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.600
 term which will allow us as 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.430
 some countries have already benefited from 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.030
 this expertise to really have the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.740
 tools not to navigate by sight and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.739
 tools allowing us to project ourselves 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:18.010
 forward precisely no it's 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.320
 the first time we develop 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.800
 we are moving in the direction of a strategy 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.410
 overall 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.470
 we defined made diagnoses 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.950
 for particular sectors of 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.350
 sectors for example port take a 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.290
 example we tried to identify 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.830
 the same the trades and the needs of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.320
 skills 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.660
 today it's about having a 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.269
 global strategy taking to taking into 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.920
 account the entire national economy and 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.190
 want and with all sectors 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.530
 of activity carriers so as to better and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.400
 in detail to better target our 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.860
 skill needs 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.860
 There it is, thanks
