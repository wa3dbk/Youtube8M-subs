00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.580
 how about friends of youtube today I'm going to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.880
 show this machine that serves to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 manufacture stirrups completely 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:22.120
 manual and in a very really very 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.910
 very simple to manufacture the rings 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.650
 Excuse me please, here I am 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.230
 blocking the screen a little bit with 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.710
 this information I had an experience 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.620
 with a person from argentina who is 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 publishing my machines and he claims that 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.780
 they are from him then to avoid 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.600
 confusions in people who see my 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.220
 videos because unfortunately I had to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.800
 block the screen a little bit with that 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.530
 my information but going back to the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 machine this machine can realize 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.360
 children 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.360
 with measurements from 10 to 10 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.630
 50 x 50 and any variant measure 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.310
 among them I will form them I will form a 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.310
 ring of 10 x 10 and 1 of 10 x 15 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.200
 revolution 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 yes 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.250
 there are 10 x 10 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.469
 now to form the 10 x 15 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.659
 yes 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.190
 m 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.770
 yes 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.520
 [Applause] 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 yes yes 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 in general 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.380
 You can see the days of 10 x 15 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 6 by 10 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.930
 the machine can very easily be 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.930
 operate anyone who can 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.890
 pull a lever of 15 kilograms of 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.890
 pressure could make these rings 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.329
 the machine is very small 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.850
 It measures approximately one meter and 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.200
 medium long 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.200
 by one meter high 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 and you can see the material laurie that is 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 on the floor it normally goes on a slide 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 roll of 150 kilograms of capacity 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.860
 Greetings out there to Mauricio from Argentina 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 thank you
