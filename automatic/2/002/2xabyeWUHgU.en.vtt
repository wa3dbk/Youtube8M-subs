stenciling this morning and the thing

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.149 
stenciling this morning and the thing
about<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.149> soy<00:01:27.299> wax<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> making<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
about the soy wax that is making it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.459 
about the soy wax that is making it
doubly<00:01:29.579> useful<00:01:29.609> is<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.569> washes<00:01:30.780> out<00:01:31.229> with

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
doubly useful is that it washes out with

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.760 
doubly useful is that it washes out with
hot<00:01:31.679> water<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> soap<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.079> when<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> goes<00:01:34.469> into

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
hot water and soap and when it goes into

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 
hot water and soap and when it goes into
that<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> breaks<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.329> dissolves<00:01:36.810> in

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that when it breaks down or dissolves in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.139 
that when it breaks down or dissolves in
a<00:01:37.140> sense<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.310> wash<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.700> away<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
a sense then you can wash it away and so

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.969 
a sense then you can wash it away and so
it's<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.539> hard<00:01:39.749> on<00:01:39.869> pipes<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.499> so<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's not hard on pipes and so a lot of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.230 
it's not hard on pipes and so a lot of
things<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.429> they're<00:01:41.999> more

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
things about it they're more

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.819 
things about it they're more
environmentally<00:01:42.960> normally<00:01:43.530> I've<00:01:43.710> been

working with some soy wax too now that I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
working with some soy wax too now that I
could<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.899> let<00:01:46.109> this<00:01:46.229> sit<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.649> skillet<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
could just let this sit in my skillet to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160 
could just let this sit in my skillet to
when<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.579> sure<00:01:47.939> using<00:01:48.149> edifices<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.929> I<00:01:48.960> just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
when I'm sure using edifices so I just

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.989 
when I'm sure using edifices so I just
having<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.859> own<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.789> want<00:01:50.909> to

having your own little you want to

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.080 
having your own little you want to
dedicate<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:52.369> leave<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.429> in<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.819> reheat

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
dedicate it leave it in there and reheat

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.669 
dedicate it leave it in there and reheat
it<00:01:54.179> again<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.569> he's<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> again<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.469> I<00:01:55.619> think

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
it again and he's it again and I think

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.709 
it again and he's it again and I think
it's<00:01:56.100> important<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.639> realize<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.569> should

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it's important to realize what it should

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.879 
it's important to realize what it should
look<00:01:57.749> like<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.759> flakes<00:02:00.619> sometimes<00:02:01.619> if

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
look like so it's in flakes sometimes if

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.980 
look like so it's in flakes sometimes if
you're<00:02:02.069> going<00:02:02.880> online<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.509> example<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.959> find

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you're going online for example to find

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.779 
you're going online for example to find
wax<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.859> might<00:02:05.069> buy<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.429> they<00:02:05.549> call<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
wax you might buy what they call a

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.370 
wax you might buy what they call a
pillar<00:02:06.090> wax<00:02:06.389> which<00:02:06.749> is<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:07.319> for

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pillar wax which is really more for

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.889 
pillar wax which is really more for
candles<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.850> can<00:02:09.030> use<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
candles and you can use it it's not that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.300 
candles and you can use it it's not that
it<00:02:09.959> won't<00:02:10.080> work<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.950> realize

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it won't work but you have to realize

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
it won't work but you have to realize
that<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.730> meant<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.030> stiff<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that it's meant to be stiff so the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.780 
that it's meant to be stiff so the
candle<00:02:13.230> will<00:02:13.319> hold<00:02:13.500> its<00:02:13.650> shape<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
candle will hold its shape and that that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.520 
candle will hold its shape and that that
could<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:14.970> problematic<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.930> wash<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.380> as

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
could be problematic and not wash out as

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.970 
could be problematic and not wash out as
easily<00:02:16.680> later<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.730> information<00:02:18.240> yeah<00:02:18.980> okay

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
easily later so information yeah okay

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.390 
easily later so information yeah okay
great

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
great

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.699 
great
now<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:21.090> working<00:02:21.300> with<00:02:21.480> sponge<00:02:21.930> stamps<00:02:22.500> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
now I'm working with sponge stamps and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.830 
now I'm working with sponge stamps and
this<00:02:23.189> is<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.549> know<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.939> just<00:02:24.150> from<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.629> car

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
this is you know this just from the car

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
this is you know this just from the car
wash<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.500> they're<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> couple<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.640> different

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
wash and they're a couple of different

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.380 
wash and they're a couple of different
kinds

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
kinds

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.640 
kinds
this<00:02:27.510> way<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.720> get<00:02:27.870> double<00:02:28.170> duty<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this way I get double duty with the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.040 
this way I get double duty with the
texture<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.330> used<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.780> scissors

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
texture and I just used the scissors

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.440 
texture and I just used the scissors
here<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.010> trim<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.550> space<00:02:32.850> out<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
here to trim this space out and it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.780 
here to trim this space out and it's
this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.959> great<00:02:34.250> great<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.459> get<00:02:35.670> out

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790

yeah we are this is one of my
specialties<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.819> high-tech<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.230> we've

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
specialties is high-tech and so we've

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.350 
specialties is high-tech and so we've
got<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.740> stamp<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.580> also<00:02:44.730> using<00:02:45.120> the

second high-tech tool I want to share
with<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.100> interfacing<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.440> could<00:02:49.650> cut

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
with you is interfacing and I could cut

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.710 
with you is interfacing and I could cut
a<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.040> detailed<00:02:50.310> design<00:02:50.970> for<00:02:51.330> example

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
a very detailed design for example

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.320 
a very detailed design for example
here's<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.050> stencil<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.770> made<00:02:53.040> using<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.580> hot

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
here's a stencil that I made using a hot

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.110 
here's a stencil that I made using a hot
knife<00:02:54.360> uh-huh<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.470> cutting<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
knife uh-huh I'm cutting this is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.790 
knife uh-huh I'm cutting this is
interfacing<00:02:57.540> too<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.410> reason<00:02:58.680> it's

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
interfacing too and the reason it's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.170 
interfacing too and the reason it's
black<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.310> because<00:02:59.550> I've<00:02:59.670> used<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
black is just because I've used it so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.729 
black is just because I've used it so
many<00:03:00.300> times<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.720> paint<00:03:01.050> changed<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> color

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
many times that paint changed the color

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.680 
many times that paint changed the color
but<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.489> either<00:03:02.640> use<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.000> scissors<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.540> cut

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
but I can either use the scissors to cut

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240 
but I can either use the scissors to cut
through<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> interfacing<00:03:04.620> or<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:04.800> can<00:03:04.980> use<00:03:05.010> an

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
through the interfacing or I can use an

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.040 
through the interfacing or I can use an
exacto<00:03:05.550> knife<00:03:05.940> or<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.239> can<00:03:06.450> use<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.600> wood<00:03:06.840> burning

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
exacto knife or I can use a wood burning

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.440 
exacto knife or I can use a wood burning
tool<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.430> use<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> lot<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> found

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
tool so you can use a lot of found

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.810 
tool so you can use a lot of found

knife<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.100> want<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.340> careful<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
knife you want to be careful on that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.789 
knife you want to be careful on that
interfacing<00:03:30.480> because<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.110> polyester

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
interfacing because it's it's polyester

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.039 
interfacing because it's it's polyester
and<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.220> should<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.549> well<00:03:32.700> ventilated<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.480> we

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
and that should be well ventilated so we

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.030 
and that should be well ventilated so we
want<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.260> be<00:03:34.350> clear<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
want to be clear about that

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.530 
want to be clear about that
now<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.310> wax<00:03:35.579> actually<00:03:36.000> melts<00:03:36.329> pretty

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
now the wax actually melts pretty

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.390 
now the wax actually melts pretty
quickly<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.320> does<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.829> what<00:03:37.920> temperature<00:03:38.070> do

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
quickly it does and what temperature do

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.740 
quickly it does and what temperature do
you<00:03:38.430> said<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.820> keep<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> temperature<00:03:39.570> down

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you said it I keep the temperature down

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.690 
you said it I keep the temperature down
at<00:03:39.959> about<00:03:40.049> simmer<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.799> an<00:03:41.070> electric<00:03:41.430> skillet

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
at about simmer on an electric skillet

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.729 
at about simmer on an electric skillet
like<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> skillet<00:03:43.320> because<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
like this I like a skillet because it's

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.650 
like this I like a skillet because it's
a<00:03:43.829> broad<00:03:44.040> surface<00:03:44.549> if<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.970> had<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> tiny<00:03:45.480> little

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
a broad surface if I had a tiny little

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.050 
a broad surface if I had a tiny little
hot<00:03:45.930> pot<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.380> some<00:03:46.829> people<00:03:47.160> use<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.579> couldn't

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
hot pot but some people use I couldn't

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.630 
hot pot but some people use I couldn't
get<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> stamp<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.750> size<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:50.280> I've<00:03:50.489> got

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
get a stamp this size in it so I've got

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.160 
get a stamp this size in it so I've got
several<00:03:50.910> ways<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.780> this<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.140> can

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
several ways that I can do this I can

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.590 
several ways that I can do this I can
just<00:03:52.440> dip<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.980> stamp<00:03:54.230> into<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.560> hot<00:03:55.709> wax<00:03:55.980> and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
just dip the stamp into the hot wax and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.150 
just dip the stamp into the hot wax and
this<00:03:57.600> is<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.079> piece<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.320> white<00:03:58.680> muslin<00:03:58.920> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
this is just a piece of white muslin and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.770 
this is just a piece of white muslin and
you've<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> printing<00:04:00.180> pad<00:04:00.360> right

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you've got it on a printing pad right

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.509 
you've got it on a printing pad right
yeah<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.200> use<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> couple<00:04:01.799> layers<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.130> felt<00:04:02.370> in

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
yeah I use a couple layers of felt in

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.819 
yeah I use a couple layers of felt in
order<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.820> have<00:04:02.940> an<00:04:03.060> absorbent<00:04:03.600> surface<00:04:04.019> which

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
order to have an absorbent surface which

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.069 
order to have an absorbent surface which
is<00:04:05.010> good<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.700> I'm<00:04:05.910> doing<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.239> stenciling<00:04:06.810> I

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
is good if I'm doing the stenciling I

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.470 
is good if I'm doing the stenciling I
have<00:04:07.920> these<00:04:08.100> brushes<00:04:08.370> here's<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.060> good<00:04:09.269> trick

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
have these brushes here's a good trick

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.300 
have these brushes here's a good trick
put<00:04:09.810> rubber<00:04:10.019> bands<00:04:10.320> around<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.769> handles<00:04:11.160> so

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
put rubber bands around the handles so

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.460 
put rubber bands around the handles so
they<00:04:11.430> don't<00:04:11.610> float<00:04:11.940> otherwise<00:04:12.930> they'll<00:04:13.200> fall

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
they don't float otherwise they'll fall

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.930 
they don't float otherwise they'll fall
into<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.890> waxy<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.579> keeps<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.910> from

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
into the waxy so that keeps it from

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.729 
into the waxy so that keeps it from
falling<00:04:15.299> yeah<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.989> gives<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.289> a<00:04:16.350> little<00:04:16.560> ledge

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
falling yeah it gives you a little ledge

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.250 
falling yeah it gives you a little ledge
there<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.510> can<00:04:18.660> just<00:04:18.810> brush<00:04:19.019> the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
there so with this I can just brush the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.740 
there so with this I can just brush the
wax<00:04:19.470> one<00:04:20.100> advantage<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.789> soy<00:04:20.970> wax<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.510> that

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
wax one advantage of the soy wax is that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.750 
wax one advantage of the soy wax is that
it<00:04:21.870> stays<00:04:22.640> pliable<00:04:23.640> longer<00:04:24.360> than<00:04:25.039> can<00:04:26.039> not<00:04:26.580> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
it stays pliable longer than can not the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.880 
it stays pliable longer than can not the
candle<00:04:27.090> wax<00:04:27.180> but<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.660> petroleum-based<00:04:28.440> wax

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
candle wax but the petroleum-based wax

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.830 
candle wax but the petroleum-based wax
so<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.340> doesn't<00:04:29.729> cool<00:04:30.000> right<00:04:30.330> away<00:04:30.510> doesn't

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
so it doesn't cool right away doesn't

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.050 
so it doesn't cool right away doesn't
cool<00:04:31.020> as<00:04:31.289> quickly<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.400> allows<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.910> to

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
cool as quickly so it allows you to

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.700 
cool as quickly so it allows you to
stencil<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.750> work<00:04:33.870> with<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.169> brush<00:04:34.410> see

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
stencil it and work with the brush see

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.529 
stencil it and work with the brush see
what<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.070> other<00:04:35.220> wax<00:04:35.490> by<00:04:35.849> now<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.270> brush

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
what the other wax by now this brush

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.990 
what the other wax by now this brush
would<00:04:36.720> probably<00:04:37.200> be<00:04:37.349> pretty<00:04:37.500> stiff<00:04:38.000> but

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
would probably be pretty stiff but

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.750 
would probably be pretty stiff but
because<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.570> soy<00:04:39.750> wax<00:04:39.990> cools

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
because the soy wax cools

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.540 
because the soy wax cools
more<00:04:40.850> slowly<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.680> can<00:04:42.680> get<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.040> lot<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.340> mileage

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
more slowly I can get a lot of mileage

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.140 
more slowly I can get a lot of mileage
out<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:45.040> one<00:04:46.040> application<00:04:46.700> with<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.970> brush

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
out of one application with the brush

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.230 
out of one application with the brush
you<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.480> to<00:04:47.570> wash<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:48.050> stencil<00:04:49.040> no<00:04:49.880> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
you have to wash this stencil no the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.270 
you have to wash this stencil no the
stencil<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.690> fine<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.140> dedicate<00:04:51.620> my<00:04:51.770> stencils

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
stencil is fine I dedicate my stencils

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.090 
stencil is fine I dedicate my stencils
as<00:04:52.550> we're<00:04:52.850> saying<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.270> know<00:04:53.390> for<00:04:54.080> soy<00:04:54.260> wax<00:04:54.470> so

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
as we're saying you know for soy wax so

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.010 
as we're saying you know for soy wax so
I<00:04:55.430> can<00:04:55.670> just<00:04:55.880> set<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.270> aside<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:56.840> don't

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
I can just set that aside and I don't

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.740 
I can just set that aside and I don't
