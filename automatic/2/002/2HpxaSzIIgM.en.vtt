00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
Hi Foodies!

00:00:00.675 --> 00:00:01.922
Don’t tell anyone,

00:00:01.922 --> 00:00:04.282
but sometimes I like to wash my hands

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:07.157
using dish soap to get rid

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:07.897
of the fishy smell.

00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:10.902
Turns out that using normal hand soap

00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:13.692
is not the best option to wash your hands

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:16.442
because the germs are still there.

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.688
The solution is to use

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.401
Lifebuoy Kitchen Fresh

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.681
after touching fresh food.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.070
And by scrubbing for 10 seconds,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.790
the germs will be gone and

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:29.307
your hands won’t smell fishy anymore.

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:31.948
Now that my hands are clean

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.348
it’s time for me to cook for my family.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:35.852
Let’s get cooking!

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:45.682
Hi Foodies!

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.346
We meet again with Hijab Chef.

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:48.516
This time, Hijab Chef

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.860
is going to cook a variety

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.160
of menu for Ramadhan.

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.342
And this time I am going to cook

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.073
Chicken Rendang

00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:56.732

00:00:56.732 --> 00:00:57.732
process will be like?

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.129
