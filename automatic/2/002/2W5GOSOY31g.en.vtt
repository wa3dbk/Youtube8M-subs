00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.210 
love the choreography that we get to do
but<00:02:06.009> we<00:02:06.250> need<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:07.090> come<00:02:07.479> across<00:02:07.929> like<00:02:08.319> we<00:02:08.920> love

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
but we need to come across like we love

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.699 
but we need to come across like we love
it<00:02:09.479> sometimes<00:02:10.479> when<00:02:10.660> I'm<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:10.899> an<00:02:11.020> audition<00:02:11.349> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
it sometimes when I'm in an audition and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.650 
it sometimes when I'm in an audition and
they<00:02:11.800> ask<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.130> freestyle<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.790> turns<00:02:13.150> into<00:02:13.420> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
they ask for freestyle it turns into a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780 
they ask for freestyle it turns into a
trick<00:02:14.200> fest<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.459> wondered<00:02:15.760> how

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
trick fest and I wondered how

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.790 
trick fest and I wondered how
choreographers<00:02:16.569> feel<00:02:16.780> about<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:17.470> far<00:02:17.770> as

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
choreographers feel about that as far as

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.620 
choreographers feel about that as far as
a<00:02:17.890> trick<00:02:18.190> fest<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:19.800> mean<00:02:20.800> sometimes<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.910> got<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
a trick fest I mean sometimes you got to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.820 
a trick fest I mean sometimes you got to
just<00:02:22.720> be<00:02:22.900> aware<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.230> what's<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.800> around
