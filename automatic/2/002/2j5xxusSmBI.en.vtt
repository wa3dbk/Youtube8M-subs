00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 Who does not like to make art? 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 sure you love and you also have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.310
 an art corner in your house has no 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.470
 it 's not everyone has a little corner 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 mess a little corner to do all the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 arts and collages and everything not yu 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:35.430
 only when you mess do not even know right 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:37.620
 here is the size of the nylon thread and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 passed a lot of colored buttons not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.829
 So we can make the necklace then. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.879
 Look, I'll show you how the staff is. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 at home right? 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 io will help me also because we 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 Let's do it if she puts it, it's beautiful. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 here at the beginning of the program is a game that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 how wonderful in so full of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 colorful buttons, that's how it stayed there 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 You will get the colored nylon yarn 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.870
 in case there the little button that for me you 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.439
 will pass here 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.030
 as if it were a seam even if it were 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.470
 a line is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 and of course it has to be those buttons 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.380
 big can not be little 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 you went to have no problem, the meaning 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 This may be the way you like it. 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.500
 leave a little space and put the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.710
 another and this puts in the other 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.720
 This may end up happening in the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 other thread because the collar is large is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 very big chic 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.850
 both know or understand so guarantee 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.640
 and here is how it is right at the end of it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 I got hurt or very close and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.979
 now I can not do it either 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 I just answered that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:07.229
 wait a minute wait a minute now was the yoki will there 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.690
 and that takes and pulls I did not turn my ring 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.430
 And I get nervous about you . 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.459
 stone so there thigh seen now worked 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.230
 right well training the mines have to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.709
 to get well 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.599
 half to the other at the end for me she gave a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.090
 button knob could not do the most 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:33.030
 It's difficult, it's over, he tries to suffer. 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.420
 pass and she knotted iii rise to i ta 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.519
 and it goes back and then you are pulling well 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.810
 line until you get close to others 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.870
 buttons on this 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.769
 so just pass several colors mix 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.799
 all 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.560
 and the more mixed it gets, the better. 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.420
 there for example to join the two wires 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:59.280
 because in my necklace there are two lines 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 here to join the two wires to 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.860
 People are going to do the following I 'll get 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.349
 this other point that gabi is not 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.370
 I'm going to join the tip with 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.670
 Very good tip, that's how I'll get it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.010
 A little button is bigger and I'm going to 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.180
 two dots together and here the same 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.480
 thing 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.810
 On the other hand, it goes through the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.910
 that I'm going to pull and then get stuck 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.160
 also the two neighbors here are 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.200
 trapped together then you just do 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.010
 this on both sides and then the chocolate goes 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.200
 stay like this 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.480
 big one then you can understand're 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.010
 several sizes can 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.739
 several mixed neighbors pass from one 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.670
 next to each other and neither of their fashion and make 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.670
 happiness differently
