open with some hydraulic gas stress and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.420 
open with some hydraulic gas stress and
then<00:01:58.230> we<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.470> take<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.620> look<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.010> inside

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
then we could take a look at the inside

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.080 
then we could take a look at the inside
here<00:01:59.460> we<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> psychoanalyst<00:02:01.490> meter<00:02:02.490> right

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
here we have a psychoanalyst meter right

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.010 
here we have a psychoanalyst meter right
