00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 I am at a distance of 150 I can 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.770
 to catch 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.710
 there is a bottle installed and 30 years old 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.110
 how much cola and carton is clean with three 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.809
 we will try to shoot targets now 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 Schmeisser type bullet drum 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:06.720
 about 10 shots 1 there last 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:12.390
 stayed in pmc see how it goes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:18.970
 looks like a target in optics 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:25.560
 bottle carton recording time left 2 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 minutes is not enough card 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 try what happens 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.600
 we will give a dental adjustment because 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960
 as far as 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.770
 almost guessed 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.570
 Now I will not turn the drum very much 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.610
 I will stupidly aim at one point and there 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.610
 let's see while thin where the bullets flew 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.820
 Sorry on the photo by 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:25.650
 chegos film 10 shots Now go 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.650
 let's see what happened with us 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.810
 the door is not closed 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.120
 everything was so funny wipe it 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.610
 Bill fix a little sight 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.720
 workouts 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.720
 ricocheting bullets from billa bottle 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:35.310
 so here and go warm . 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.310
 compared to Julia, well, just a giant 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:58.470
 here is a 150 meter sighting that is in 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.120
 principle 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:12.660
 Well basically a pack of cigarettes 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.660
 probably yes looking for scatter 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:34.660
 bummed to stone but the bow fell on 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.400
 inform 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:51.010
 mom bullets what you find can be scraps 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:58.390
 such as a rifle but not 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:06:04.419
 still work on tuning but for now 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:11.470
 especially no time I shoot because it 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:16.080
 there is a principle I think it will be nice 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:20.830
 bullets or 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:25.380
 there is a spread but it is fixable think it 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.070
 more to do with the bullet itself than the rifle 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.060
 because they are not. 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:39.740
 recent and not stored in individual 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:42.700
 like a pack or rifles 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.700
 machine to machine 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.300
 bye everyone
