00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.260
 many modified maps are 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 complaining that you could not get 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 it looks like you click the button 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.489
 right and open a new window gave 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 links do not see it now works ok 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 personal bmx maps so cool because 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.430
 they are focused on making an instant of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.980
 bm both with the person so that x 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.379
 passing through the difficult bridges and tals 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.320
 Let's see what we can do. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.640
 The beautiful woman 's score is getting good 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 garden and his team since now I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.280
 I lost pretty, right? 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.650
 the tactic of sending our not here 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 You can also let him play. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 that favorite that is what gives a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 force the disclosure of the video here and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 Itabom ba 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.030
 And then I count on your support. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.220
 really very important for 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.750
 that the channel is still there so I can continue 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 producing this legal content for the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.840

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.000

 Come on, let's finish this jump here. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.579
 in addition to the description that my 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 social networks as you already know many 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.450
 people still ask but the best 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 Way to talk to me on twitter. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.820

 jacuzzi chair what the fuck is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 to face each question then it is as follows 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.000
 twitter is the best way to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.400
 communicate with me I read the comments 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.480
 of the video is often even answered 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
 depending on the comment 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
 depending on how you are but like me 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.780
 I always tell youtube it limits the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 number of replies in comments 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.230
 It's but if you want to say something 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 with regards it is referring to the video 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.370
 absolutely the best place is the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.200
 comment because as I do many 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 videos galeras you comment with me about 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 the video on twitter we usually play 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.900
 This one I saw that you're talking about 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.819
 It seems incredible and my memory is 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.160
 far already kind if she again the top would 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.230
 aggravating the fourth fifth video he is 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.819
 speaking of the first then there I am 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.190
 lose because of the time normally 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.840
 of the book 's release is then 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 Bad for me, it was about the video. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.160
 information about the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.930
 so why the mps the review 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.489

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.980
 on facebook a partnership with germer 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.150
 arena and they stayed mean 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.250

 but he would like it very easy because he kind 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.930
 so I think maybe he 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.730
 as it happened it should be much more 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.190
 Legal investees is a shitload of 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.129
 wretched and such but individual is very 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.319
 easy it has little challenge and few 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.669
 instants of both pretty random in the house 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.730
 blood by little to arrive in the morning 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:25.500
 chicken case the bomb a good step 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.690

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.209
 snake now arriving a very nice part 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.510
 the track that has several points in a row 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.810

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.299

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.760

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.859

 he so plan to play alone but 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.019
 Multiplayer license in the face as 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.849
 almost all legal places and such 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.549
 probably because they call this 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.569
 map with the mod has nothing different 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.510
 but probably some places here 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.699
 would not accept these ramps and so 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.880
