 Pistol and shrimp mantis are both crustaceans that snap their claws and perform magic. Okay, 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.580
 At least sound and light display: the plane of water deprives them of their claws 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.969
 Travels at such velocities that it is a hollow - liquid water under negative pressure is literally 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.169
 Lying to bubbles of water vapor. When bubbles collapse on themselves, 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.980
 They give off the "snap" and, surprisingly, a small high flash of light. Shrimp use 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.880
 The acoustic shock wave to stun or kill the prey, but physicists are more interested in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 A flash of light, because we still do not know exactly why it happens. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
 Crash bubbles can also be created in a laboratory simply by using sound-since 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 It seems, as we know, is basically just molecules pushing repeatedly against each other, and 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.990
 Then pull separately, if the sound waves are intense enough, the low pressure will again 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.540
 Be low enough to pull the liquid to steam away and cause cavity bubbles. Bubbles 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.750
 Then collapses, and under certain conditions, they produce a brighter light than 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 shrimp. This is called the phenomenon of turning sound into a "sound visual" light. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.090
 We know that the light flashes are incredibly short - only took about 100 picoseconds 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.439
 - Surprisingly high energy, this means the collapse bubbles may be up to 10 times 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440
 More hot than the surface of the sun. 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
 We do not know for sure, though how much inside a bubble that gets hot, or what exactly 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.190
 Is giving off light. The bubble collapses rapidly from gases and inside heated 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.000
 By pressure, but increasing pressure may also cause water vapor in the bubble 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.010
 Quickly condense back into the liquid, releasing large amounts of latent heat. 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.720
 The flash itself may come from incandescent glowing argon or xenon gas in the air bubble, 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 Or from the heat to tear the water vapor away to hydroxide and hydrogen ions that then coalesce 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 Give a light, or from the inside of the whole bubble get hot enough to become 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.659
 Glowing plasma - or it may be a combination. 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.890
 Either way, the cool thing about acoustic photodiodes is that they are still not fully understood though 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.400
 Being fairly simple to create - I mean, you can buy a basic audio visual range off 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.229
 Online! Or just get the pet mantis shrimps. 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.780
 If you want to hear about more unexplained phenomena in science, a whole bunch of YouTube stars 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.150
 Such as Vsauce, Veritasium, thebrainsoop, and so on have made "unanswered"
