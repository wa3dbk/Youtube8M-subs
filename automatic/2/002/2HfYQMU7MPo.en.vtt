hi I'm lassie and I'm teaching people in
metal<00:00:05.470> shaping<00:00:05.920> and<00:00:06.279> I<00:00:06.880> have<00:00:07.210> done<00:00:07.359> that<00:00:07.510> for

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:07.569 
metal shaping and I have done that for

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.200 
metal shaping and I have done that for
many<00:00:07.930> years<00:00:08.320> and<00:00:08.620> this<00:00:09.490> piece<00:00:09.849> that<00:00:09.880> I'm<00:00:10.179> going

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
many years and this piece that I'm going

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.060 
many years and this piece that I'm going
to<00:00:10.480> talk<00:00:10.690> about<00:00:10.719> now<00:00:11.200> I<00:00:11.230> am<00:00:11.469> NOT<00:00:11.620> going<00:00:11.830> to<00:00:11.889> make

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
to talk about now I am NOT going to make

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
to talk about now I am NOT going to make
it<00:00:12.309> but<00:00:12.459> I'm<00:00:12.580> going<00:00:12.730> to<00:00:12.849> talk<00:00:13.059> about<00:00:13.269> it<00:00:13.540> and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it but I'm going to talk about it and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.370 
it but I'm going to talk about it and
this<00:00:14.860> was<00:00:15.129> a<00:00:15.539> problem<00:00:16.539> for<00:00:16.720> me<00:00:16.870> for<00:00:17.140> many<00:00:17.289> years

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
this was a problem for me for many years

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.410 
this was a problem for me for many years
because<00:00:18.039> I<00:00:18.160> didn't<00:00:18.610> know<00:00:18.730> how<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:18.970> make<00:00:19.210> it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
because I didn't know how to make it

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.240 
because I didn't know how to make it
with<00:00:19.750> all<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.050> classes<00:00:20.320> -<00:00:20.710> all<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.890> hands-on

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
with all the classes - all the hands-on

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.920 
with all the classes - all the hands-on
classes<00:00:21.580> I<00:00:21.940> learned<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.390> much<00:00:22.540> from<00:00:22.600> my

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
classes I learned so much from my

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.250 
classes I learned so much from my
student<00:00:23.440> and<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:25.090> day<00:00:25.270> I<00:00:25.300> figured<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:25.900> out<00:00:26.020> how

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
student and one day I figured it out how

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.010 
student and one day I figured it out how
to<00:00:26.320> make<00:00:26.590> this<00:00:26.770> piece<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.480> is<00:00:28.630> actually

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
to make this piece so this is actually

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.830 
to make this piece so this is actually
the<00:00:29.170> door<00:00:29.470> window<00:00:30.010> frame<00:00:30.370> for<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> 33<00:00:31.570> three

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
the door window frame for a 33 three

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.029 
the door window frame for a 33 three
window<00:00:32.140> coupe<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:35.199> most<00:00:35.499> important

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
window coupe and the most important

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.130 
window coupe and the most important
thing<00:00:36.249> is<00:00:36.429> hot<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.969> start<00:00:37.390> something<00:00:38.109> like

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
thing is hot to start something like

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.479 
thing is hot to start something like
that<00:00:38.499> so<00:00:39.399> let's<00:00:39.699> say<00:00:40.030> this<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.899> actually<00:00:41.530> the

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
that so let's say this is actually the

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.729 
that so let's say this is actually the
piece<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.670> was<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.059> door<00:00:46.329> I<00:00:46.659> would<00:00:47.409> mark

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
piece if this was the door I would mark

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.450 
piece if this was the door I would mark
this<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.339> here<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.300> is<00:00:49.510> actually<00:00:49.960> for<00:00:50.460> for

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
this and here this is actually for for

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.540 
this and here this is actually for for
bending<00:00:51.969> that<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.559> double<00:00:54.190> bend<00:00:54.399> eight

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
bending that that double bend eight

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.969 
bending that that double bend eight
hundred<00:00:54.850> eighty<00:00:54.969> degrees<00:00:55.449> around<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:56.140> frame

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
hundred eighty degrees around the frame

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.009 
hundred eighty degrees around the frame
the<00:00:57.729> inside<00:00:58.089> frame<00:00:59.489> yes<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:00.819> know<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.659> the

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
the inside frame yes so you know so the

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.330 
the inside frame yes so you know so the
first<00:01:02.670> part<00:01:03.720> when<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:04.750> made<00:01:05.140> my<00:01:05.170> template<00:01:06.100> for

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
first part when I made my template for

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.230 
first part when I made my template for
this<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:07.829> marked<00:01:08.829> this<00:01:09.040> out<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.729> got<00:01:09.969> this

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
this I marked this out so I got this

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.429 
this I marked this out so I got this
line<00:01:10.689> here<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.390> will<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.689> from<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.290> red

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
line here but it will be from the red

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.590 
line here but it will be from the red
line<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:14.950> up<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.460> adding<00:01:16.000> for<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.270> flange

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
line and up so I adding for the flange

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.709 
line and up so I adding for the flange
there<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.829> that<00:01:18.070> will<00:01:18.310> be<00:01:18.460> my<00:01:18.700> starting<00:01:19.450> point

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
there so that will be my starting point

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.620 
there so that will be my starting point
for<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.200> templates<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:21.880> could<00:01:22.390> always

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
for the templates then I could always

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260 
for the templates then I could always
measure<00:01:23.170> on<00:01:23.680> actually<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.369> fiberglass<00:01:24.850> call

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
measure on actually the fiberglass call

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.139 
measure on actually the fiberglass call
that<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.289> had<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.710> template<00:01:27.189> measure

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
that we that I had as a template measure

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.539 
that we that I had as a template measure
from<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.689> edge<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.829> top<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.369> door

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
from that edge of the top of the door

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.880 
from that edge of the top of the door
there<00:01:30.939> on<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.180> fiberglass<00:01:31.659> core<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.259> down

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
there on the fiberglass core and down

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.520 
there on the fiberglass core and down
and<00:01:33.340> in<00:01:33.549> under<00:01:34.000> here<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.420> see<00:01:34.570> how<00:01:34.810> much<00:01:35.020> extra

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and in under here and see how much extra

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.179 
and in under here and see how much extra
I<00:01:35.619> needed<00:01:36.130> there<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.140> remember<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.710> on

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
I needed there and you remember that on

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.719 
I needed there and you remember that on
the<00:01:39.250> car<00:01:39.640> here<00:01:39.939> this<00:01:40.600> go<00:01:40.869> in<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.140> curve<00:01:41.649> but<00:01:42.490> this

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the car here this go in a curve but this

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.069 
the car here this go in a curve but this
edge<00:01:43.030> here<00:01:43.229> should<00:01:44.229> be<00:01:44.560> pretty<00:01:44.979> much<00:01:45.250> straight

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
edge here should be pretty much straight

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.209 
edge here should be pretty much straight
for<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.259> window<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.590> when<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.829> made<00:01:51.189> my

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
for the window so when I made my

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.080 
for the window so when I made my
template<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.240> paper<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.490> specific

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
template in paper for that that specific

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.209 
template in paper for that that specific
top<00:01:55.990> piece<00:01:56.380> there<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.969> see<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:59.009> it's<00:02:00.009> hard

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
top piece there you see that it's hard

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.190 
top piece there you see that it's hard
for<00:02:00.369> me<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.640> hold<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.969> but<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.630> see<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.929> top

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
for me to hold it but you see the top

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
for me to hold it but you see the top
edge<00:02:02.469> there<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.979> actually<00:02:03.369> curved<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
edge there is actually curved but the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.830 
edge there is actually curved but the
bottom<00:02:05.049> there<00:02:05.259> it's<00:02:05.530> more<00:02:05.829> straight<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.659> that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
bottom there it's more straight so that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.130 
bottom there it's more straight so that
means<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.380> have<00:02:08.530> more<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.659> center

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
means that I have more in the center

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.190 
means that I have more in the center
here<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.590> roll<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:12.069> under<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:13.300> makes<00:02:13.720> this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
here to roll in under that makes this

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.960 
here to roll in under that makes this
edge<00:02:15.069> here

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
edge here

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.630 
edge here
more<00:02:16.360> straight<00:02:16.840> when<00:02:17.110> I'm<00:02:17.290> done<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:18.520> I

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
more straight when I'm done because I

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.820 
more straight when I'm done because I
have<00:02:18.910> more<00:02:19.150> material<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:19.990> thicker<00:02:20.500> here

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
have more material so it's thicker here

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.560 
have more material so it's thicker here
and<00:02:21.040> thinner<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.730> thinner<00:02:21.820> here<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.550> then<00:02:25.540> I

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
and thinner and thinner here and then I

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.840 
and thinner and thinner here and then I
did<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.350> similar<00:02:26.710> thing<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.220> bottom<00:02:27.580> here

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
did the similar thing on the bottom here

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.600 
did the similar thing on the bottom here
so<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> actually<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.990> more<00:02:29.620> material<00:02:30.250> here<00:02:30.280> in

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
so I actually have more material here in

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.430 
so I actually have more material here in
the<00:02:30.640> center<00:02:31.150> than<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.930> front<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
the center than I have in the front and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.170 
the center than I have in the front and
the<00:02:32.680> back<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.860> make<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.790> piece

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the back when we make that this piece

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
the back when we make that this piece
you<00:02:37.510> see<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.990> we<00:02:38.290> actually<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.800> more<00:02:39.070> curve

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
you see that we actually have more curve

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.860 
you see that we actually have more curve
here<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> flat<00:02:41.050> piece<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:43.570> this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
here so if I take a flat piece like this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.010 
here so if I take a flat piece like this
and<00:02:44.460> run<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.060> bead<00:02:46.360> roll<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.840> make

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
and run that in the bead roll and make

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.400 
and run that in the bead roll and make
that<00:02:47.290> bead<00:02:47.680> first<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.170> edge

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
that bead first and I can use this edge

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.950 
that bead first and I can use this edge
to<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.860> guide<00:02:51.100> if<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.970> run<00:02:52.210> that<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> flat

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
to the guide if I run that on a flat

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.090 
to the guide if I run that on a flat
piece<00:02:53.490> then<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:55.150> whole<00:02:55.390> piece<00:02:56.260> will<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.770> too

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
piece then the whole piece will be too

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.880 
piece then the whole piece will be too
flat<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.270> will<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.660> be<00:02:58.720> curved<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.620> this

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
flat so it will not be curved like this

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.310 
flat so it will not be curved like this
as<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.340> sits<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.820> car<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.420> will<00:03:01.600> be<00:03:01.780> more<00:03:02.020> flat

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
as it sits on a car it will be more flat

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.170 
as it sits on a car it will be more flat
with<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> bead<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.250> that's<00:03:03.730> not<00:03:03.940> what<00:03:04.150> I

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
with a bead on it and that's not what I

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.860 
with a bead on it and that's not what I
want<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.280> case<00:03:06.670> we're<00:03:07.090> rolling<00:03:07.720> up

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
want so in this case we're rolling up

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.040 
want so in this case we're rolling up
this<00:03:08.170> extra<00:03:09.070> material<00:03:09.580> here<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.960> English

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
this extra material here in the English

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.450 
this extra material here in the English
wheel<00:03:11.410> before<00:03:11.950> we<00:03:12.550> put<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.060> first<00:03:13.420> bead<00:03:13.930> on

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
wheel before we put the first bead on

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.850 
wheel before we put the first bead on
this<00:03:15.460> part<00:03:15.880> then<00:03:16.870> when<00:03:17.080> we<00:03:17.200> are<00:03:17.320> put<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> bead

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
this part then when we are put the bead

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.710 
this part then when we are put the bead
on<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.370> takes<00:03:18.640> up<00:03:18.820> all<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.240> extra<00:03:19.570> material

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
on it takes up all that extra material

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.979 
on it takes up all that extra material
but<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.560> also<00:03:20.770> have<00:03:21.250> more<00:03:21.610> curve<00:03:22.390> when<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.840> are

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
but we also have more curve when we are

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.660 
but we also have more curve when we are
done<00:03:23.260> there<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.920> gives<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.370> little

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
done there so that gives you a little

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.350 
done there so that gives you a little
idea<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.900> be<00:03:29.110> done<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.850> also<00:03:30.850> here

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
idea that it can be done and also here

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.530 
idea that it can be done and also here
in<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.959> edge<00:03:32.560> here<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.459> corners<00:03:33.940> when<00:03:34.390> we

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
in the edge here in the corners when we

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.770 
in the edge here in the corners when we
Bend<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.080> in<00:03:35.320> it's<00:03:36.190> an<00:03:36.370> inner<00:03:36.670> curve<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
Bend that in it's an inner curve in the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.170 
Bend that in it's an inner curve in the
curve<00:03:38.020> here<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:39.010> needs<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.489> be<00:03:39.640> stretched

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
curve here and it needs to be stretched

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.210 
curve here and it needs to be stretched
and<00:03:40.600> we're<00:03:40.810> actually<00:03:40.959> using<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.620> bead<00:03:41.920> roller

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and we're actually using the bead roller

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.160 
and we're actually using the bead roller
to<00:03:42.550> stretch<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.840> have<00:03:43.959> watched

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
to stretch that and if you have watched

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.340 
to stretch that and if you have watched
all<00:03:44.590> our<00:03:45.160> other<00:03:45.430> video<00:03:45.850> on<00:03:46.060> YouTube<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:47.140> have

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
all our other video on YouTube you have

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.110 
all our other video on YouTube you have
a<00:03:47.380> video<00:03:47.860> about<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.340> when<00:03:48.550> I'm<00:03:48.700> talking

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
a video about that when I'm talking

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.670 
a video about that when I'm talking
about<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.050> bead<00:03:50.230> will<00:03:50.410> how<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
about that in the bead will how to

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.320 
about that in the bead will how to
stretch<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.070> panel<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:55.120> we're

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
stretch that this is a panel that we're

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.020 
stretch that this is a panel that we're
going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.630> do<00:03:56.350> on<00:03:56.530> our<00:03:56.560> new<00:03:56.920> series<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.610> videos

going to do on our new series of videos

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.830 
going to do on our new series of videos
when<00:03:58.900> it's<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.010> blue<00:04:00.250> series<00:04:00.610> of<00:04:01.060> video<00:04:01.450> where

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
when it's a blue series of video where

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.290 
when it's a blue series of video where
we're<00:04:02.080> making<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> parts<00:04:03.130> for<00:04:03.310> 33<00:04:03.820> 3u<00:04:04.180> in

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
we're making all the parts for 33 3u in

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.509 
we're making all the parts for 33 3u in
the<00:04:04.420> coop<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.989> when<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.130> all<00:04:06.340> those

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
the coop and when we have all those

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.380 
the coop and when we have all those
parts<00:04:07.030> done<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.630> filmed<00:04:08.260> on<00:04:08.530> DVDs<00:04:09.340> save<00:04:10.180> them

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
parts done and filmed on DVDs save them

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.860 
parts done and filmed on DVDs save them
on<00:04:10.540> DVDs<00:04:10.959> we're<00:04:11.769> going<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.220> make<00:04:12.760> several<00:04:13.269> DVDs

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
on DVDs we're going to make several DVDs

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.500 
on DVDs we're going to make several DVDs
when<00:04:14.260> we<00:04:14.440> assembly<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.220> whole<00:04:15.400> car<00:04:15.850> body<00:04:16.150> so

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
when we assembly the whole car body so

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.170 
when we assembly the whole car body so
you<00:04:16.570> can<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.169> whole<00:04:17.350> process<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.700> is

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
you can see the whole process this is

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.920 
you can see the whole process this is
very<00:04:19.930> good<00:04:20.200> for<00:04:20.530> people<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.840> thinking<00:04:22.840> about

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
very good for people that thinking about

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.170 
very good for people that thinking about
to<00:04:23.230> build<00:04:23.410> their<00:04:23.560> own<00:04:23.680> car<00:04:24.010> body<00:04:24.280> because<00:04:25.030> the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
to build their own car body because the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.380 
to build their own car body because the
principle<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.500> same<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.760> parts<00:04:28.210> is

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
principle is the same the parts is

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.370 
principle is the same the parts is
little<00:04:28.660> different

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
little different

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.080 
little different
it's<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> same<00:04:29.980> principle<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.850> same

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
it's the same principle and the same

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.510 
it's the same principle and the same
technique<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.870> use<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.470> build<00:04:32.950> any<00:04:33.190> car

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
technique you can use to build any car

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.450 
technique you can use to build any car
body<00:04:34.200> if<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.380> want<00:04:35.560> more<00:04:35.740> information<00:04:36.370> about
