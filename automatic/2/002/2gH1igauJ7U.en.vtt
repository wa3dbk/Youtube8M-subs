 6 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.949
 but what happens in God is that that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.770
 career that you start is a career 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.189
 that God is going to put in you the strength to 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.399
 that you are running and do not tire 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.989
 they are social forces and logics like 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.770
 is that in the middle of I run running 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.020
 run, I'm not going to get tired in God 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.760
 that is the advantage that we have children 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.640
 of God by having Christ in our 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.920
 lives because you can all in Christ he 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.780
 it takes you from power to power as it says 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.300
 verse 7 so you do not get tired if 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.850
 you are facing in this way that 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.030
 you are running moments of temptation 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.190
 what did you say I'm going to keep me in my 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 sexuality and marriage 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.690
 enemy is wanting to bring temptations 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.800
 your life is not do not give up 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.280
 and there runs do not get distracted and neither 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.080
 look back there is that I remember that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.200
 before I get to church I do 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.050
 could do it and then we started 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.530
 want what we had before without knowing 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.600
 to Christ and that starts to distract you and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.910
 that starts to limit you and that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.390
 start to confuse and you end up moving 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.820
 you of the Lord and that is not what God 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.880
 has for you because you were born to 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.700
 win and this race you're going to win 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.500
 you will not lose that in the middle of 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.280
 this race we can slip and we 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.280
 we can fall if 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.659
 but you know what you have to do 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.229
 get up clean your knees and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.229
 keep running 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.950
