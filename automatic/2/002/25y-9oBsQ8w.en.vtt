as<00:02:26.620> possible<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.159> get<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.489> by<00:02:27.670> having

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
as possible and you get that by having

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.000 
as possible and you get that by having
the<00:02:28.060> echos<00:02:28.360> moving<00:02:28.720> as<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.349> set<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> take<00:02:29.860> off

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the echos moving as you set to take off

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160 
the echos moving as you set to take off
so<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:30.579> line<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.269> runway<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.900> you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so you line it up on the runway and you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.690 
so you line it up on the runway and you
set<00:02:32.379> pickup<00:02:32.709> trucks<00:02:32.920> while<00:02:33.159> the<00:02:33.310> aircraft<00:02:33.640> is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
set pickup trucks while the aircraft is

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.899 
set pickup trucks while the aircraft is
still<00:02:33.790> moving<00:02:34.299> that's<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.079> thing<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:36.609> other

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
still moving that's one thing the other

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.929 
still moving that's one thing the other
thing<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.189> be<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> bit<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.849> a

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
thing that's going to be a bit of a

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.670 
thing that's going to be a bit of a
complication<00:02:40.390> during<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.200> actual<00:02:41.409> take

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
complication during the actual take

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.349 
complication during the actual take
controllers<00:02:42.189> as<00:02:42.400> you're<00:02:42.730> moving<00:02:42.879> down<00:02:43.209> the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
controllers as you're moving down the

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:43.890 
controllers as you're moving down the
runway

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
runway

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.229 
runway
of<00:02:44.140> course<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.739> wind<00:02:44.980> will<00:02:45.609> be<00:02:45.760> coming<00:02:46.090> and

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
of course the wind will be coming and

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.319 
of course the wind will be coming and
pushing<00:02:46.989> on<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.439> huge<00:02:47.709> rather<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:49.060> what

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
pushing on this huge rather here so what

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.750 
pushing on this huge rather here so what
happens<00:02:49.659> then<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.079> that<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.650> aircraft<00:02:51.340> has<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
happens then is that the aircraft has to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.300 
happens then is that the aircraft has to
weathercock<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:53.049> towards<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.530> wind<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
weathercock in towards the wind so it

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.009 
weathercock in towards the wind so it
will<00:02:54.459> turn<00:02:54.730> towards<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.480> direction<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
will turn towards the direction of the

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.569 
will turn towards the direction of the
wind<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.769> need<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> counteract<00:02:57.489> that

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
wind and you need to counteract that

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.390 
wind and you need to counteract that
with<00:02:57.730> ruther<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.810> as<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.889> wind<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.190> pushing

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
with ruther so as the wind is pushing

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.670 
with ruther so as the wind is pushing
rather<00:03:00.819> you'll<00:03:01.209> contracted<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:02.049> your<00:03:02.230> other

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
rather you'll contracted with your other

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.479 
rather you'll contracted with your other
pedals<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.489> you're<00:03:03.790> moving<00:03:03.939> down<00:03:04.239> but<00:03:05.489> before

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
pedals and you're moving down but before

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.860 
pedals and you're moving down but before
you<00:03:06.609> also<00:03:06.760> need<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.060> put<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.299> little<00:03:07.569> bit<00:03:07.750> of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you also need to put a little bit of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.649 
you also need to put a little bit of
aileron<00:03:08.379> into<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.159> wind<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.209> not<00:03:10.329> too<00:03:10.480> much

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
aileron into the wind and not too much

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.229 
aileron into the wind and not too much
if<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:10.959> put<00:03:11.139> in<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:11.439> than<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> half

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
if you put in more than one and a half

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.780 
if you put in more than one and a half
units<00:03:13.239> on<00:03:13.450> your<00:03:13.930> yoke<00:03:14.170> it'll<00:03:14.859> mean<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
units on your yoke it'll mean that the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.490 
units on your yoke it'll mean that the
flight<00:03:16.090> spoilers<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.750> going<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.019> start<00:03:17.230> rates

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
flight spoilers is going to start rates

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.679 
flight spoilers is going to start rates
in<00:03:17.799> your<00:03:17.920> wings<00:03:18.099> which<00:03:18.700> will<00:03:18.939> then<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.420> create

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
in your wings which will then be create

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.289 
in your wings which will then be create
more<00:03:19.900> drag<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:21.040> will<00:03:21.280> increase<00:03:21.849> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
more drag and that will increase the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.360 
more drag and that will increase the
takeoff<00:03:22.720> roll<00:03:22.959> distance<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.799> also<00:03:23.919> decrease

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
takeoff roll distance and also decrease

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.599 
takeoff roll distance and also decrease
your<00:03:25.500> tape<00:03:26.500> clearance<00:03:26.889> which<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.430> something

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
your tape clearance which is something

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.479 
your tape clearance which is something
you<00:03:27.790> definitely<00:03:28.030> want<00:03:28.629> to<00:03:28.690> try<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.019> avoid<00:03:29.489> so

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
you definitely want to try to avoid so

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.640 
you definitely want to try to avoid so
at<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.329> moment<00:03:31.510> then<00:03:31.810> you're<00:03:32.139> putting<00:03:32.500> a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
at the moment then you're putting a

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.589 
at the moment then you're putting a
little<00:03:32.829> bit<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.639> wind<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.269> coming<00:03:34.389> from

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
little bit of the wind is coming from

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.879 
little bit of the wind is coming from
this<00:03:34.750> direction<00:03:34.810> you're<00:03:35.379> putting<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.739> bit<00:03:35.859> of

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
this direction you're putting a bit of

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.649 
this direction you're putting a bit of
left<00:03:36.190> rudder<00:03:36.519> in<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:36.909> order<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.209> maintain<00:03:37.329> the

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
left rudder in in order to maintain the

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.720 
left rudder in in order to maintain the
center<00:03:37.900> line<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.409> you'll<00:03:39.069> also<00:03:39.340> put<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> little

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
center line and you'll also put a little

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.789 
center line and you'll also put a little
bit<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:40.030> right<00:03:40.449> aileron<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.440> make<00:03:41.590> sure

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
bit of right aileron in to make sure

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.149 
bit of right aileron in to make sure
that<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.310> aircraft<00:03:42.669> doesn't<00:03:43.139> flip<00:03:44.139> over<00:03:44.319> with

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
that the aircraft doesn't flip over with

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.849 
that the aircraft doesn't flip over with
wind<00:03:45.430> thanks<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.239> only<00:03:46.359> as<00:03:46.599> much<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:47.199> long<00:03:47.709> as

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
wind thanks but only as much a long as

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.280 
wind thanks but only as much a long as
you<00:03:47.949> need<00:03:48.129> in<00:03:48.280> order<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.549> keep<00:03:48.879> the<00:03:49.449> wings

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you need in order to keep the wings

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.189 
you need in order to keep the wings
level<00:03:51.299> this<00:03:52.299> means<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.019> get<00:03:53.139> into

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
level this means that as you get into

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.140 
level this means that as you get into
the<00:03:53.620> rotation<00:03:53.949> you<00:03:54.579> will<00:03:54.609> actually<00:03:55.000> have

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the rotation you will actually have

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.449 
the rotation you will actually have
cross<00:03:55.419> control<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.169> you'll<00:03:56.319> have<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:57.159> be<00:03:57.250> left

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
cross control so you'll have to be left

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.399 
cross control so you'll have to be left
or<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> little<00:03:57.699> bit<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.000> right<00:03:58.239> aileron<00:03:58.449> it<00:03:58.810> now

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
or a little bit of right aileron it now

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.469 
or a little bit of right aileron it now
this<00:03:59.919> will<00:04:00.159> in<00:04:00.280> itself<00:04:00.699> cause<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.479> bit<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:03.479> bit

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
this will in itself cause a bit of a bit

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.839 
this will in itself cause a bit of a bit
of<00:04:04.599> extra<00:04:05.019> drag<00:04:05.229> which<00:04:05.829> means<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.310> your<00:04:06.519> tail

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
of extra drag which means that your tail

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.229 
of extra drag which means that your tail
fears<00:04:07.209> will<00:04:08.049> be<00:04:08.280> slightly<00:04:09.280> less<00:04:09.549> your<00:04:09.819> margin

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
fears will be slightly less your margin

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.059 
fears will be slightly less your margin
food<00:04:10.449> is<00:04:10.599> slightly<00:04:10.840> less<00:04:11.079> which<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.349> makes<00:04:11.919> it

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
food is slightly less which is makes it

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.620 
food is slightly less which is makes it
even<00:04:12.250> more<00:04:12.400> important

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
even more important

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.500 
even more important
that<00:04:15.320> your<00:04:15.590> rotation<00:04:16.160> rate<00:04:16.400> is<00:04:16.910> those<00:04:17.270> two

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
that your rotation rate is those two

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.210 
that your rotation rate is those two
degrees<00:04:17.780> per<00:04:17.959> second<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:18.440> what<00:04:18.890> tends<00:04:19.130> to

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
degrees per second now what tends to

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.490 
degrees per second now what tends to
happen<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.760> people<00:04:20.360> sitting<00:04:21.020> with<00:04:21.380> this

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
happen is that people sitting with this

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.930 
happen is that people sitting with this
they're<00:04:21.739> having<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.010> little<00:04:22.100> bit<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.430> trouble

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
they're having a little bit of trouble

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.540 
they're having a little bit of trouble
majoring<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.690> center<00:04:23.990> line<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.560> they

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
majoring in the center line and they

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.010 
majoring in the center line and they
want<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:26.000> away<00:04:26.090> from<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.690> ground<00:04:26.900> as

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
want to get away from the ground as

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.660 
want to get away from the ground as
quickly<00:04:27.050> as<00:04:27.350> possible<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.800> get<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.520> this

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
quickly as possible to get out of this

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.880 
quickly as possible to get out of this
cross<00:04:29.030> control<00:04:29.480> situation<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.230> what<00:04:30.380> what

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
cross control situation so what what

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.420 
cross control situation so what what
actually<00:04:31.430> happen<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:33.050> people<00:04:33.430> voltage

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
actually happen is that people voltage

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.520 
actually happen is that people voltage
much<00:04:34.700> quicker<00:04:35.000> with<00:04:35.480> cross<00:04:35.750> swing<00:04:35.960> now<00:04:36.470> you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
much quicker with cross swing now you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.710 
much quicker with cross swing now you
have<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.070> be<00:04:37.190> very<00:04:37.520> careful<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.540> to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
have to be very careful that you have to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.930 
have to be very careful that you have to
make<00:04:38.990> sure<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.470> don't<00:04:39.680> do<00:04:40.100> that<00:04:40.340> because

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
make sure that you don't do that because

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.270 
make sure that you don't do that because
with<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.050> cross<00:04:42.260> controls<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.920> if<00:04:43.130> you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
with the cross controls in if you

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.420 
with the cross controls in if you
suddenly<00:04:43.610> injure<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.690> air<00:04:45.170> cuffs<00:04:45.440> off<00:04:46.160> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
suddenly injure the air cuffs off the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.420 
suddenly injure the air cuffs off the
runway<00:04:46.960> seems<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.170> have<00:04:48.380> maybe<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.160> little<00:04:49.280> bit

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
runway seems you have maybe a little bit

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.830 
runway seems you have maybe a little bit
of<00:04:49.520> smaller<00:04:49.760> deflection<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.420> you<00:04:50.480> are<00:04:50.630> going

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
of smaller deflection and you are going

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.870 
of smaller deflection and you are going
to<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.110> put<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.320> bit<00:04:51.440> more<00:04:51.470> annual<00:04:52.340> into

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
to have to put a bit more annual into

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.550 
to have to put a bit more annual into
the<00:04:52.970> wind<00:04:53.210> as<00:04:53.390> you<00:04:53.660> rotate<00:04:54.080> because<00:04:54.380> that's

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
the wind as you rotate because that's

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.470 
the wind as you rotate because that's
when<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> aircraft<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:55.280> can<00:04:55.640> feel<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.240> full

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
when the aircraft is can feel the full

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.980 
when the aircraft is can feel the full
force<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.620> cross<00:04:57.800> swing<00:04:58.390> it's<00:04:59.390> highly

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
force of the cross swing it's highly

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.170 
force of the cross swing it's highly
likely<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.620> were<00:05:01.400> actually<00:05:01.880> more<00:05:02.120> likely

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
likely that were actually more likely

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.120 
likely that were actually more likely
that<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.200> will<00:05:03.320> say<00:05:03.530> strike

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
that you will say strike

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.420 
that you will say strike
so<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:05.470> crosswind<00:05:06.470> takeoff<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:07.100> something

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
so the crosswind takeoff is something

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.510 
so the crosswind takeoff is something
that<00:05:07.580> we<00:05:07.820> practice<00:05:08.360> quite<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.690> lot<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:10.070> requires

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
that we practice quite a lot it requires

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.260 
that we practice quite a lot it requires
a<00:05:11.590> lot<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.620> practice<00:05:12.890> in<00:05:13.220> order<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.460> get<00:05:13.700> really

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
a lot of practice in order to get really

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.480 
a lot of practice in order to get really
confident<00:05:15.140> with<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.420> said<00:05:20.480> be

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
confident with it and like I said be

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.740 
confident with it and like I said be
with<00:05:22.490> what<00:05:22.640> we<00:05:22.760> tend<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.030> do<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.450> if<00:05:23.480> the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
with what we tend to do is if the

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.450 
with what we tend to do is if the
crosswinds<00:05:24.200> goes<00:05:24.380> over<00:05:24.650> 50<00:05:25.010> knots

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
crosswinds goes over 50 knots

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.670 
crosswinds goes over 50 knots
more<00:05:25.970> or<00:05:26.030> less<00:05:26.150> at<00:05:26.390> least<00:05:26.420> in<00:05:26.690> my<00:05:26.780> airline<00:05:27.110> we

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
more or less at least in my airline we

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.740 
more or less at least in my airline we
tend<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.130> let<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.400> captain<00:05:28.580> do<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.060> but<00:05:29.630> of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
tend to let the captain do it but of

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.570 
tend to let the captain do it but of
course<00:05:29.780> first<00:05:30.500> officers<00:05:30.920> do<00:05:31.100> need<00:05:31.370> to

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
course first officers do need to

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.360 
course first officers do need to
practice<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.090> as<00:05:32.270> well<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:32.720> we<00:05:33.200> try<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.470> get

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
practice this as well so we try to get

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.790 
practice this as well so we try to get
everyone<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.970> do<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.540> little<00:05:35.810> bit<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.050> you

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
everyone to do it a little bit of you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.280 
everyone to do it a little bit of you
know<00:05:37.090> harder<00:05:38.090> costs<00:05:38.450> when<00:05:38.600> during<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.050> line

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
know harder costs when during the line

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.500 
know harder costs when during the line
training<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:39.830> let<00:05:39.980> me<00:05:40.100> get<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.250> chance<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:41.030> to

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
training so let me get a chance to to

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.400 
training so let me get a chance to to
get<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.840> feeling<00:05:42.080> of<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:42.440> but

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
get the feeling of it but

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.430 
get the feeling of it but
in<00:05:44.920> essence<00:05:45.370> when<00:05:46.210> from<00:05:46.390> from<00:05:46.630> procedures<00:05:47.230> and

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
in essence when from from procedures and

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.990 
in essence when from from procedures and
so<00:05:47.590> on<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.830> procedures<00:05:48.250> are<00:05:48.400> exactly<00:05:48.820> the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
so on the procedures are exactly the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.190 
so on the procedures are exactly the
same<00:05:49.030> you<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.390> have<00:05:49.660> to<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.870> aware<00:05:49.990> that

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
same you just have to be aware that

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.140 
same you just have to be aware that
these<00:05:50.590> extra<00:05:51.070> complications<00:05:51.700> are<00:05:51.850> in<00:05:51.970> there

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
these extra complications are in there

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.990 
these extra complications are in there
when<00:05:52.330> you're<00:05:52.420> leading<00:05:52.660> with<00:05:52.810> costly<00:05:54.000> costly

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
when you're leading with costly costly

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.670 
when you're leading with costly costly
landings<00:05:55.630> is<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.840> completely<00:05:56.170> different<00:05:56.380> thing

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
landings is a completely different thing

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.920 
landings is a completely different thing
which<00:05:56.920> I'll<00:05:57.100> do<00:05:57.220> completely<00:05:57.670> full<00:05:58.600> forecast

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
which I'll do completely full forecast

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.410 
which I'll do completely full forecast
about<00:05:59.350> but<00:05:59.950> I<00:05:59.980> just<00:06:00.190> wanted<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.520> make<00:06:00.730> this<00:06:00.940> 1/2

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
about but I just wanted to make this 1/2

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.590
