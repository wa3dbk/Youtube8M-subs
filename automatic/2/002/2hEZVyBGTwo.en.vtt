00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:26.230
 but this cold evening is white or 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:28.240
 help the temperature outside the window still leaves 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210
 conti I do not want to see anyone and someone 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.660
 even you canâ€™t cry but only 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.700
 women 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.250
 thank you close thank you what is higher 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.440
 Wednesday but no one understood that his little 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.960
 now it's not just not in love 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.239
 just sadness is what makes 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.550
 heart beat more often know poker on my 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.620
 feelings like they know you I know that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.899
 that your heart is different to others is me 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.269
 wounded know laziness to call you for and i 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.340
 he said love and you certainly did not believe me 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.949
 i wanted to be you darling be you 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 first i'm sick oh well say 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.910
 time to lie down 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.129
 but surely there was no way this flew 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 least through pierced your cold 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 the answer is probably true I will not forgive by and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.130
 flowers are not with me 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 they are not white this cold evening 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.619
 will only help kill and perhaps 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.899
 I dream I didn't get you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.090
 enough hear and what is missing and you do not 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.219
 with me 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.679
 cold evening white does not help only 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.929
 Iâ€™ll only slaughter and parabellum 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.270
 I dream how everything got me 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.340
 enough to hear and not enough for me 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.259
 nice to dream and represent the moment 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.539
 go along we like you all 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.969
 good but life is probably not so 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.049
 I was not destined to give your hobby so 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.060
 gods decided 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.740
 I'm all on board to meet you 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.840
 new year fasten say with whom 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.069
 You will meet the topics and I would 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.259
 now really was happy 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.690
 really and cream show passed then 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.670
 I would not have been shed in vain and what is probably 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.860
 then I asked you all about meeting it so 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.290
 silly as you are at the counter to me 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.480
 say friends drive it true a 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.600
 you know why because you are not around 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.670
 go give lessons instead of writing and I 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.890
 I know that this song will pass your ears 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.890
 I am not a romantic and I write poems and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:23.110
 beautiful white not only to me not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:28.300
 missing hungry evenings can only 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.300
 dreaming I'm missing
