00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
opinion the best part of camping is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.660 
opinion the best part of camping is

was that the teacher in this episode was
Luna<00:04:20.750> instead<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.470> Celestia

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
Luna instead of Celestia
