and<00:00:11.700> everyone<00:00:12.179> seems<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:13.049> but

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.709 
and everyone seems to be doing it but
how<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.920> Samsung's<00:00:14.370> latest<00:00:14.580> version<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.599> is

how is Samsung's latest version this is

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.410 
how is Samsung's latest version this is
my<00:00:15.870> review<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> Samsung<00:00:16.590> Galaxy<00:00:16.980> Note<00:00:17.430> 4

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.640 

so<00:00:24.420> right<00:00:24.570> off<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> bat<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.199> doesn't<00:00:25.500> seem

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so right off the bat it doesn't seem

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
so right off the bat it doesn't seem
like<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> whole<00:00:25.980> lot<00:00:26.039> has<00:00:26.369> changed<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> that's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
like a whole lot has changed and that's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.359 
like a whole lot has changed and that's
because<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.930> true<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.010> really<00:00:29.279> an

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
because it's true this is really an

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
because it's true this is really an
iteration<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> note<00:00:30.300> 3<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> takes

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
iteration on the note 3 and it takes

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.479 
iteration on the note 3 and it takes
what<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> did<00:00:31.619> great<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> makes<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> even

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
what it did great and makes it even

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
what it did great and makes it even
better<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> some<00:00:33.420> cases<00:00:33.630> does<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
better and in some cases does what the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080 
better and in some cases does what the
note<00:00:34.590> 3<00:00:34.800> didn't<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.340> great<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> updates

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
note 3 didn't do so great and updates

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.639 
note 3 didn't do so great and updates
that<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.480> well<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.170> first<00:00:37.410> thing<00:00:37.530> you'll

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
that as well the first thing you'll

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.840 
that as well the first thing you'll
notice<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.100> pick<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> phone<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
notice when you pick up the phone is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
notice when you pick up the phone is
that<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> edges<00:00:39.390> are<00:00:39.480> made<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.809> metal<00:00:40.020> yes

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that the edges are made out of metal yes

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
that the edges are made out of metal yes
finally<00:00:41.190> Samsung<00:00:41.820> did<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.570> included

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
finally Samsung did it they included

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.510 
finally Samsung did it they included
metal<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.320> their<00:00:43.469> phones<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> say

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
metal on their phones and I have to say

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
metal on their phones and I have to say
it<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.000> adds<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> premium<00:00:45.899> feel

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it really adds to the premium feel

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
it really adds to the premium feel
Samsung<00:00:46.710> wants<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> phone<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.180> has

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
Samsung wants this phone to have it has

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
Samsung wants this phone to have it has
chamfered<00:00:48.899> edges<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.710> much<00:00:49.860> every

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
chamfered edges on pretty much every

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
chamfered edges on pretty much every
edge<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.760> possibly<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
edge that could possibly be and it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
edge that could possibly be and it
really<00:00:52.140> looks<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.710> more<00:00:52.860> premium<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
really looks a lot more premium than it

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
really looks a lot more premium than it

on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> galaxy<00:01:34.860> s5<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.000> still

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
on the galaxy s5 but really it's still

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
on the galaxy s5 but really it's still
hit<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.659> miss<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> because

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
of that for the most part I just left it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.060 
of that for the most part I just left it
off<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.560> wasn't<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070

so<00:02:51.170> every<00:02:51.500> image<00:02:51.740> has<00:02:51.920> artifacting<00:02:52.550> if<00:02:52.670> you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
so every image has artifacting if you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.430 
so every image has artifacting if you
zoom<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.210> little<00:02:53.330> bit<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:54.050> can<00:02:54.230> really

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
zoom in a little bit you can really

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.840 
zoom in a little bit you can really
notice<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.040> low-light<00:02:55.400> shots<00:02:55.580> there's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
notice this in low-light shots there's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.550 
notice this in low-light shots there's
just<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.090> ton<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.330> processing<00:02:57.050> going<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.410> here

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
just a ton of processing going on here

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.050 
just a ton of processing going on here
that<00:02:57.740> really<00:02:57.920> doesn't<00:02:58.160> feel<00:02:58.490> like<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.760> has<00:02:58.880> to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
that really doesn't feel like it has to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.560 
that really doesn't feel like it has to
be<00:02:59.090> done

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
be done

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.970 
be done
Samsung<00:02:59.960> really<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.410> wants<00:03:00.620> there<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.860> be<00:03:00.950> a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
Samsung really just wants there to be a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.890 
Samsung really just wants there to be a
clean<00:03:01.250> image<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> processing<00:03:02.540> kind<00:03:02.810> of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
clean image but the processing kind of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.720 
clean image but the processing kind of
goes<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.050> little<00:03:03.200> too<00:03:03.350> far<00:03:03.470> as<00:03:04.130> far<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.520> video

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
goes a little too far as far as video

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.280 
goes a little too far as far as video
the<00:03:04.910> camera<00:03:05.150> shoots<00:03:05.330> 4k<00:03:05.600> which<00:03:05.960> looks<00:03:06.200> great

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the camera shoots 4k which looks great

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.290 
the camera shoots 4k which looks great
my<00:03:07.010> only<00:03:07.190> real<00:03:07.400> complaint<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.180> it's

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
my only real complaint here and it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.000 
my only real complaint here and it's
kind<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.780> small<00:03:09.020> one<00:03:09.200> is<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.650> optical

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
kind of a small one is that the optical

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.100 
kind of a small one is that the optical
image<00:03:10.160> stabilization<00:03:10.640> works<00:03:11.270> but<00:03:11.690> can<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.080> a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
image stabilization works but can have a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.750 
image stabilization works but can have a
warping<00:03:12.530> effect<00:03:12.890> if<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.070> move<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.550> little

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
warping effect if you move it a little

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.790 
warping effect if you move it a little
bit<00:03:13.850> too<00:03:14.000> much<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.780> that's<00:03:15.080> really<00:03:15.320> my<00:03:15.560> only

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
bit too much but that's really my only

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.770 
bit too much but that's really my only
complaint<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.700> video<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.120> sharp<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.570> looks

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
complaint the video is sharp and looks

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.180 
complaint the video is sharp and looks
really<00:03:18.140> nice<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.350> pretty<00:03:18.860> much<00:03:18.950> every

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
really nice and pretty much every

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.070 
really nice and pretty much every
situation<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.850> shot<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> was<00:03:20.900> really

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
situation I shot in and it was really

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.750 
situation I shot in and it was really
nice<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.440> shoot<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.800> this<00:03:22.310> phone<00:03:22.520> is<00:03:22.640> running

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
nice to shoot with this phone is running

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.780 
nice to shoot with this phone is running
Android<00:03:23.260> 4.4.4<00:03:24.260> kitkat<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.310> course<00:03:25.550> it

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
Android 4.4.4 kitkat and of course it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.520 
Android 4.4.4 kitkat and of course it
has<00:03:25.910> TouchWiz<00:03:26.360> on<00:03:26.450> top<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.170> if

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
has TouchWiz on top of that and if

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.560 
has TouchWiz on top of that and if
you've<00:03:27.650> used<00:03:27.680> TouchWiz<00:03:28.400> before<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.210> pretty

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
you've used TouchWiz before it's pretty

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.630 
you've used TouchWiz before it's pretty
much<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.900> same<00:03:30.050> thing<00:03:30.260> here<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:31.160> performance

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
much the same thing here the performance

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.130 
much the same thing here the performance
overall<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:32.030> really<00:03:32.330> good<00:03:32.540> but<00:03:32.750> there<00:03:32.990> really

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
overall is really good but there really

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.320 
overall is really good but there really
is<00:03:33.410> some<00:03:33.680> unnecessary<00:03:34.010> stuttering<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.120> lag

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
is some unnecessary stuttering and lag

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.240 
is some unnecessary stuttering and lag
here<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.500> phone<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.830> plenty<00:03:37.160> of

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
here and there the phone is plenty of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.770 
here and there the phone is plenty of
power<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.550> run<00:03:37.670> pretty<00:03:38.000> much<00:03:38.090> anything<00:03:38.480> but

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
power to run pretty much anything but

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.900 
power to run pretty much anything but
there's<00:03:39.020> still<00:03:39.290> delay<00:03:39.650> sometimes<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.730> most

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
there's still delay sometimes the most

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.070 
there's still delay sometimes the most
obvious<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.450> when<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:41.690> go<00:03:41.810> into<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
obvious is when you go into the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.290 
obvious is when you go into the
multitasking<00:03:42.770> carousel<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.610> always<00:03:43.820> takes<00:03:44.210> a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
multitasking carousel it always takes a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.730 
multitasking carousel it always takes a
second<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.690> activate<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.320> then<00:03:45.470> once<00:03:45.620> you're

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
second to activate and then once you're

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.080 
second to activate and then once you're
in<00:03:45.860> there<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.160> choose<00:03:46.310> an<00:03:46.460> app<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.940> takes

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
in there and choose an app it takes

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.700 
in there and choose an app it takes
another<00:03:47.360> second<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.930> actually<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.500> back

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
another second to actually get you back

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.350 
another second to actually get you back
into<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:48.980> app<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.520> this<00:03:49.640> happens<00:03:50.030> almost

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
into that app and this happens almost

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.930 
into that app and this happens almost
every<00:03:50.720> single<00:03:51.020> time<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:52.010> TouchWiz<00:03:52.430> definitely

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
every single time so TouchWiz definitely

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.730 
every single time so TouchWiz definitely
needs<00:03:53.120> some<00:03:53.330> work<00:03:53.510> but<00:03:53.810> compared<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.500> what<00:03:54.560> it

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
needs some work but compared to what it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.180 
needs some work but compared to what it
used<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:54.980> be

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
used to be

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.400 
used to be
it<00:03:55.430> definitely<00:03:55.610> has<00:03:55.910> improved<00:03:56.330> TouchWiz<00:03:57.200> does

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
it definitely has improved TouchWiz does

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.110 
it definitely has improved TouchWiz does
come<00:03:57.620> with<00:03:57.740> some<00:03:57.800> neat<00:03:58.100> stuff<00:03:58.130> one<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.030> the

come with some neat stuff one of the
main<00:03:59.270> features<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.930> note<00:04:00.080> lineup<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
main features in the note lineup is the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.160
