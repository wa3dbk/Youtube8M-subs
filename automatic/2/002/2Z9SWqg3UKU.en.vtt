the clutch is fairly simple and it works

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
the clutch is fairly simple and it works

clutch single clutch disc I don't really

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.770 
clutch single clutch disc I don't really
recommend<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:41.059> it'll<00:00:42.059> tend<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> burn<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
recommend it as it'll tend to burn the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
recommend it as it'll tend to burn the
disc<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.499> bit<00:00:43.649> quicker<00:00:43.949> than<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
disc up a little bit quicker than you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.239 
disc up a little bit quicker than you
would<00:00:45.269> imagine

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
would imagine

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.250 
would imagine
anyway<00:00:47.249> pre<00:00:47.789> loading<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> clutch<00:00:48.480> basically

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
anyway pre loading the clutch basically

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.979 
anyway pre loading the clutch basically
what<00:00:49.409> it<00:00:49.530> does<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.370> preloads<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.480> drivetrain

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
what it does it preloads the drivetrain

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.399 
what it does it preloads the drivetrain
it<00:00:52.949> puts<00:00:53.190> load<00:00:53.429> against<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.909> motor<00:00:54.409> helps

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
it puts load against the motor helps

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.020 
it puts load against the motor helps
boot<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> build<00:00:56.069> a<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> boost<00:00:56.789> up

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
boot and build a little bit of boost up

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.290 
boot and build a little bit of boost up
but<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.409> benefits<00:00:58.409> of<00:00:58.589> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.030> it<00:01:00.030> keeps

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
but the benefits of it is it keeps

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.959 
but the benefits of it is it keeps
things<00:01:00.510> from<00:01:00.870> breaking<00:01:01.729> since<00:01:02.729> you're<00:01:02.850> not

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
things from breaking since you're not

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
things from breaking since you're not
shocking<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.809> tires<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> drivetrain

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
shocking the tires and the drivetrain

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
shocking the tires and the drivetrain
it's<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.250> hard<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.750> ahead<00:01:06.870> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it's so hard when you go ahead and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
it's so hard when you go ahead and
launch<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.560> car<00:01:08.390> excuse<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:10.550> so<00:01:11.550> there<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
launch the car excuse me so there are

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
launch the car excuse me so there are
plenty<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.200> benefits<00:01:13.440> for<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:15.860> I've<00:01:16.860> I've

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
plenty of benefits for for it I've I've

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.850 
plenty of benefits for for it I've I've
noticed<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.149> it's<00:01:18.630> helped<00:01:18.960> me<00:01:19.079> out<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> pro

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
noticed that it's helped me out on a pro

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
noticed that it's helped me out on a pro
tree<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.579> I<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:22.409> ebrake<00:01:22.950> or

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
tree you know I could use the ebrake or

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
tree you know I could use the ebrake or
a<00:01:23.340> hydraulic<00:01:23.939> handbrake<00:01:24.320> bring<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
a hydraulic handbrake bring it up in the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
a hydraulic handbrake bring it up in the
pre<00:01:26.040> stage<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.700> start<00:01:27.060> bringing<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
pre stage and start bringing it up on a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350 
pre stage and start bringing it up on a
two<00:01:28.020> step<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.619> using<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.130> EB<00:01:29.369> brake<00:01:30.180> or

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
two step and then using the EB brake or

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
two step and then using the EB brake or
the<00:01:30.719> handbrake<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.829> start<00:01:32.039> bumping<00:01:32.280> into<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the handbrake to start bumping into the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.130 
the handbrake to start bumping into the
stage<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.780> poetry<00:01:34.170> drops<00:01:34.950> pretty<00:01:35.250> quick

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
stage because poetry drops pretty quick

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
stage because poetry drops pretty quick
definitely<00:01:37.140> help<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.969> little<00:01:39.270> bit

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
definitely help you get a little bit

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.010 
definitely help you get a little bit
more<00:01:39.509> consistent<00:01:39.960> times<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.649> your<00:01:40.740> tree<00:01:42.020> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more consistent times on your tree but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.209 
more consistent times on your tree but
again<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.469> is<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.939> more<00:01:44.939> favorable<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
again this is all more favorable to you

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.310 
again this is all more favorable to you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
know Drive save and dry training parts

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.679 
know Drive save and dry training parts
so<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:53.210> I'm<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.509> using

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
so what I'm gonna do here I'm just using

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
so what I'm gonna do here I'm just using
an<00:01:54.929> e<00:01:55.049> brake<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> hydraulic

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
an e brake so I don't have a hydraulic

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.660 
an e brake so I don't have a hydraulic
handbrake<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.600> car<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.799> yet<00:01:59.039> anyway

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
handbrake in this car not yet anyway

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.819 
handbrake in this car not yet anyway
I<00:01:59.700> plan<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.060> putting<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.109> not<00:02:01.500> for

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
I plan on putting one in but not for

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.330 
I plan on putting one in but not for
sure<00:02:02.039> exactly<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.060> e<00:02:03.929> brake<00:02:04.170> works<00:02:05.039> just

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
sure exactly when but e brake works just

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.730 
sure exactly when but e brake works just
as<00:02:05.460> good<00:02:05.520> maybe<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:07.560> does

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
as good maybe not as good but it does

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
as good maybe not as good but it does
work<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.369> let's<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.450> ahead<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.720> start<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.080> car

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
work so let's go ahead and start the car

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.080 
work so let's go ahead and start the car
up<00:02:10.500> here

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.030 

so<00:02:17.090> okay<00:02:17.900> basically<00:02:19.209> what<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.920> know

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
so okay basically what you do you know

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.789 
so okay basically what you do you know
