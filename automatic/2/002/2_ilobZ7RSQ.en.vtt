00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and one thing because its job wrap

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.609 
and one thing because its job wrap
initially<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.289> take<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.470> little

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
initially it's going to take a little

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.550 
initially it's going to take a little
while<00:00:19.859> loading<00:00:22.880> but<00:00:23.880> any<00:00:24.390> job<00:00:24.869> application<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

going<00:00:25.650> once<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.220> loaded<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.900> think<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> blue

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
going once it's loaded I think the blue

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
going once it's loaded I think the blue
dot<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.010> assume<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.550> my<00:00:29.640> location<00:00:29.970> let's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
dot it would assume to my location let's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.770 
dot it would assume to my location let's
close<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> application<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> says<00:00:32.630> yes<00:00:33.630> or

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
close the application and it says yes or

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.819 
close the application and it says yes or
no<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.350> minimize<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.200> go<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> home

there<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> few<00:02:06.210> dedicated<00:02:06.810> widgets<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
there are a few dedicated widgets like a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.880 
there are a few dedicated widgets like a
google<00:02:08.250> search<00:02:08.459> bar<00:02:09.530> sometimes<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> things

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
google search bar sometimes the things

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.400 
google search bar sometimes the things
like<00:02:11.069> Google<00:02:11.250> Maps<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:12.180> buried<00:02:12.780> avoiding

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
like Google Maps that's buried avoiding

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
like Google Maps that's buried avoiding
the<00:02:13.500> menu

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the menu

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
the menu
so<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.130> find<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.670> useful<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.180> keep<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so I find that useful to keep on the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800 
so I find that useful to keep on the
desktop<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.850> see<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> screen<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
desktop but as you can see the screen is

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.260 
desktop but as you can see the screen is
not<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.140> big<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.250> very<00:02:20.460> easy<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.790> pretty

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
not that big so it's very easy to pretty

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.920 
not that big so it's very easy to pretty
much<00:02:21.360> cover<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.260> desktop<00:02:23.930> incidentally

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
much cover up your desktop incidentally

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.150 
much cover up your desktop incidentally
I<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.260> when<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.500> start<00:02:25.710> having<00:02:25.770> lots<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I think when you start having lots of

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.610 
I think when you start having lots of
apps<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.210> want<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> minimal<00:02:27.810> desktop

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
apps you really want a minimal desktop

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.260 
apps you really want a minimal desktop
background<00:02:29.190> otherwise<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.730> gets<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:29.970> hard

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
background otherwise it gets very hard

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
background otherwise it gets very hard
to<00:02:30.360> see<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:30.720> you're<00:02:30.810> doing<00:02:33.020> something<00:02:34.020> else

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to see what you're doing something else

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.750 
to see what you're doing something else
I<00:02:34.500> normally<00:02:34.830> keep<00:02:35.010> from<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.250> desktop<00:02:35.550> when

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
I normally keep from the desktop when

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.520 
I normally keep from the desktop when
i'm<00:02:35.850> using<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.180> phone<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.290> widget<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
i'm using this phone is this widget and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.230 
i'm using this phone is this widget and
will<00:02:40.530> let<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.800> put<00:02:41.400> all<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.580> widgets<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:42.030> top

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
will let you put all the widgets on top

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.370 
will let you put all the widgets on top
of<00:02:42.360> each<00:02:42.390> other<00:02:42.600> which<00:02:42.810> doesn't<00:02:43.140> make<00:02:43.200> them

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
of each other which doesn't make them

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.550 
of each other which doesn't make them
very<00:02:43.530> usable<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.290> really<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
very usable this is just really a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.100 
very usable this is just really a
shortcut<00:02:47.040> launching<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> Java<00:02:48.300> section

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
shortcut launching to the Java section

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.980 
shortcut launching to the Java section
of<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.770> menu<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.180> there's<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.420> bunch<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.720> java

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
of the menu so there's a bunch of java

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.900 
of the menu so there's a bunch of java
apps<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> phone<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.280> we've<00:02:53.490> already<00:02:53.580> seen

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
apps on the phone and we've already seen

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.420 
apps on the phone and we've already seen
like<00:02:54.209> Google<00:02:54.990> Maps<00:02:55.170> some<00:02:56.130> things<00:02:56.340> you

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
like Google Maps some things you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.340 
like Google Maps some things you
probably<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:56.820> get<00:02:57.240> bored<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> never<00:02:58.050> use

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
probably all get bored of and never use

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.890 
probably all get bored of and never use
more<00:02:58.590> than<00:02:58.740> once<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.520> games<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.750> can

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
more than once and games but you can

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.590 
more than once and games but you can
still<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.380> applications<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.480> what<00:03:03.480> I've

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
still have applications so what I've

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.880 
still have applications so what I've
done<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.870> added<00:03:04.320> operas<00:03:05.280> new<00:03:06.080> browser<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
done is added operas new browser this is

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.390 
done is added operas new browser this is
the<00:03:08.040> opera<00:03:08.400> mini<00:03:08.810> version<00:03:09.810> 5<00:03:10.070> second<00:03:11.070> beta

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.460 

opera<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.670> think<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> lot<00:03:15.540> quicker<00:03:15.810> than<00:03:16.080> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
opera I think is a lot quicker than the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.910 
opera I think is a lot quicker than the
default<00:03:16.620> browser<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.970> doesn't<00:03:18.420> support<00:03:18.920> an

automatic landscape mode but you can

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.250 
automatic landscape mode but you can
