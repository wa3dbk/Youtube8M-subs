00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
from my work from the air guitar okay so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.410 
from my work from the air guitar okay so
all<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:21.950> nice<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> slowly

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.050 

that's<00:01:29.990> great<00:01:32.320> timber<00:01:33.640> what<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> feeling

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
that's great timber what a feeling

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.499 
that's great timber what a feeling
really<00:01:35.300> not<00:01:35.540> eating<00:01:35.690> Bella

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.169 

so<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:42.259> way<00:01:42.469> I<00:01:42.500> will<00:01:42.799> get<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:47.590> much<00:01:48.590> solid

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
so that way I will get one much solid

00:01:49.179 --> 00:02:00.219 
so that way I will get one much solid
surface<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:56.530> paint<00:01:57.530> later<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:59.020> then<00:02:00.020> to

surface to paint later and then to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:11.740 
surface to paint later and then to
lacquer

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
this part is a bit higher than then I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.350
