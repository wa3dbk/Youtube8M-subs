I'd recommend for you guys to play
hardcore<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:36.030> best<00:00:36.180> option

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hardcore I think that's your best option

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.150 
hardcore I think that's your best option
because<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.989> hard<00:00:37.200> courts<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.040> like

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
because in hard courts I think it's like

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
because in hard courts I think it's like
a<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:39.000> shot<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.600> shot<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> pistol

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
a a one shot or a two shot with a pistol

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
a a one shot or a two shot with a pistol

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
about today is the clans situation that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
about today is the clans situation that
I'm<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> guys<00:01:46.799> did<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.460> by<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm in so if you guys did see by the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'm in so if you guys did see by the
intro<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.780> joined<00:01:49.140> doom<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:50.040> left

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
intro I have joined doom I have left

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.730 
intro I have joined doom I have left
Opie<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:51.960> different<00:01:52.140> reasons

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Opie just for you know different reasons

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
Opie just for you know different reasons
just<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:54.000> branching<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
just because they are branching out to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
just because they are branching out to
different<00:01:55.950> games<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> guys<00:01:56.790> didn't<00:01:57.149> know

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
different games if you guys didn't know

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.870 
different games if you guys didn't know
they're<00:01:57.540> branching<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> battlefield<00:01:58.590> 4

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
they're branching out to battlefield 4

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
they're branching out to battlefield 4
24<00:01:59.880> GTA<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> bunch<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> other<00:02:01.259> games<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
24 GTA and a bunch of other games and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.679 
24 GTA and a bunch of other games and
for<00:02:02.670> me<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.030> probably<00:02:03.119> wasn't<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> best

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
for me it probably wasn't the best

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.270 
for me it probably wasn't the best
option<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.130> really

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
option because you know I don't really

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.449 
option because you know I don't really
play<00:02:05.640> any<00:02:06.020> other<00:02:07.020> game<00:02:07.380> besides<00:02:07.890> cod<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> do

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
play any other game besides cod I do

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.240 
play any other game besides cod I do
play<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.720> some<00:02:10.470> single<00:02:10.770> player<00:02:10.950> games

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
play you know some single player games

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.870 
play you know some single player games
and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.550 
and
that's<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.940> bad<00:02:13.090> idea<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.840> do<00:02:14.080> play<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.380> bit

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
that's a bad idea really I do play a bit

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.590 
that's a bad idea really I do play a bit
of<00:02:14.590> GTA<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.610> ideas<00:02:15.940> i<00:02:16.150> know<00:02:16.300> when<00:02:16.570> i

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
of GTA but it's the ideas i know when i

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.110 
of GTA but it's the ideas i know when i
get<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> ps4<00:02:17.170> i<00:02:17.740> will<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.610> playing<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.970> bit<00:02:19.090> of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
get the ps4 i will be playing a bit of

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
get the ps4 i will be playing a bit of
battlefield<00:02:19.630> probably<00:02:19.990> won't<00:02:20.140> upload<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.740> but

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
battlefield probably won't upload it but

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.820
