00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
pattern you like to unlock your device

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.580 
pattern you like to unlock your device
and<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.760> does<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.119> quite<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.779> few<00:00:27.869> features

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and it does have quite a few features

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.080 
and it does have quite a few features
involved<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.670> check<00:00:29.939> out

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
involved here which we will check out

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
involved here which we will check out
here<00:00:30.300> soon<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.750> definitely<00:00:31.500> notable<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> uses

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
here soon but definitely notable it uses

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.330 
here soon but definitely notable it uses
AES<00:00:32.700> 256-bit<00:00:33.630> encryption<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:35.190> also

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
AES 256-bit encryption and it also

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.030 
AES 256-bit encryption and it also
stores<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.570> pattern<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> devices

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
stores the pattern in the devices

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.819 
stores the pattern in the devices
keychain<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.840> secure<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.680> as

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
keychain so it's very secure just as

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.910 
keychain so it's very secure just as
secure<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> iOS<00:00:42.300> passcode<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> my<00:00:43.500> opinion

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
secure as the iOS passcode in my opinion

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
secure as the iOS passcode in my opinion
and<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.850> works<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.629> well<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.260> let's<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.649> ahead

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and it works very well so let's go ahead

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
and it works very well so let's go ahead
and<00:00:47.100> check<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.210> settings

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and check out all of these settings

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
and check out all of these settings
involved<00:00:49.050> here<00:00:49.200> we're<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> back<00:00:49.680> out<00:00:49.950> to

and<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.789> under<00:00:54.000> our<00:00:54.120> tweaks<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and as you can see under our tweaks we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.750 
and as you can see under our tweaks we
have<00:00:54.899> pattern<00:00:55.289> unlock<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.610> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
have pattern unlock now if we go in

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
have pattern unlock now if we go in
there<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.390> required<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> enter<00:00:58.109> our

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
there we will be required to enter our

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
there we will be required to enter our
pattern<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> access<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.239> settings<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.930> once

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
pattern to access these settings so once

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
pattern to access these settings so once
you've<00:01:01.230> done<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> you'll<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.820> revealed<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you've done that you'll be revealed this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
you've done that you'll be revealed this
list<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> options<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.280> thing<00:01:05.400> here

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
list of options now the first thing here

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
list of options now the first thing here
we<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> turn<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.600> pattern<00:01:07.590> unlock

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we have is to turn off pattern unlock

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
we have is to turn off pattern unlock
then<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:08.820> change<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> pattern<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
then we can also change the pattern so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
then we can also change the pattern so
you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.740> by<00:01:10.860> tapping<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you can do that just by tapping on that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.580 
you can do that just by tapping on that
button<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.720> entering<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.290> old

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
button and then entering your old

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
button and then entering your old
pattern<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.180> select<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.689> new

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
pattern and then you can select a new

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
pattern and then you can select a new
one<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.920> repeat<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.340> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
one and then you have to repeat it so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
one and then you have to repeat it so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
there you go we just changed the pattern

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580 
there you go we just changed the pattern
to<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> Z<00:01:20.520> type<00:01:21.119> pattern<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.659> underneath<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to a Z type pattern now underneath that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340 
to a Z type pattern now underneath that
we<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.340> option<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.970> set<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> time

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we do have the option to set the time

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
we do have the option to set the time
interval<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> device<00:01:26.700> will

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
interval in which the device will

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
interval in which the device will
require<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> pattern<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.350> entered<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.250> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
require the pattern to be entered so as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.800 
require the pattern to be entered so as
you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> set<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you can see right here we have it set to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
you can see right here we have it set to
immediately<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.520> options<00:01:33.119> from

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
down here we do also have vibrations and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.290 
down here we do also have vibrations and
real<00:02:21.220> quick<00:02:21.400> before<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.820> into<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.180> just

out<00:02:25.480> there<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.840> theme<00:02:26.140> pattern<00:02:26.920> unlock

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
out there you can theme pattern unlock

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.830 
out there you can theme pattern unlock
but<00:02:27.460> let's<00:02:27.640> check<00:02:27.940> out<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.240> vibration

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
but let's check out the vibration

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.110 
but let's check out the vibration
settings<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.320> have<00:02:29.350> haptic<00:02:29.800> feedback<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
settings we have haptic feedback for the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
settings we have haptic feedback for the
pattern<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.870> lockscreen

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
pattern on the lockscreen

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.010 
pattern on the lockscreen
you<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.100> use<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.330> feedback<00:02:34.630> when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
you can use this to get feedback when

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.530 
you can use this to get feedback when
you're<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.890> touching<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.610> point<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
you're actually touching a point on the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.450 
you're actually touching a point on the
pattern<00:02:37.870> grid<00:02:38.170> or<00:02:38.410> you're<00:02:38.860> successfully

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
pattern grid or you're successfully

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.430 
pattern grid or you're successfully
unlocking<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> device<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.570> can<00:02:40.600> change

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
unlocking the device and you can change

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.630 
unlocking the device and you can change
these<00:02:41.620> settings<00:02:41.680> according<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.520> your

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
these settings according to your

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.920 
these settings according to your
preference<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.450> notes<00:02:43.570> here<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
preference but as it notes here the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.470 
preference but as it notes here the
first<00:02:44.170> slider<00:02:44.470> sets<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.430> vibration<00:02:46.030> duration

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
first slider sets the vibration duration

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.780 
first slider sets the vibration duration
and<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.660> second<00:02:47.080> slider<00:02:47.320> sets<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.190> vibration

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
and the second slider sets the vibration

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.120 
and the second slider sets the vibration
intensity<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.260> adjust<00:02:50.590> those<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.070> if

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
intensity so you can adjust those and if

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.980 
intensity so you can adjust those and if
you<00:02:51.160> make<00:02:51.400> something<00:02:51.640> crazy<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.750> really

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
you make something crazy and you really

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.030 
you make something crazy and you really
don't<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.590> reset<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
don't like it you can reset the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.650 
don't like it you can reset the
vibration<00:02:54.640> settings<00:02:54.940> down<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.330> at<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
vibration settings down here at the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.720 
vibration settings down here at the
bottom<00:02:56.140> as<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.320> shows<00:02:56.650> there<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.250> those<00:02:57.460> are

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
bottom as it shows there so those are

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.310 
bottom as it shows there so those are
the<00:02:57.850> vibration<00:02:58.450> settings<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.020> haptic

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
the vibration settings for the haptic

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.840 
the vibration settings for the haptic
feedback<00:02:59.350> obviously<00:03:00.310> you're<00:03:00.430> not<00:03:00.550> going<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
feedback obviously you're not going to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.120 
feedback obviously you're not going to
be<00:03:00.940> able<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.270> see<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.810> or<00:03:02.050> hear<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.680> or<00:03:02.830> feel

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
be able to see this or hear it or feel

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.680 
be able to see this or hear it or feel
it<00:03:03.160> within<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.850> video<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.480> my<00:03:04.600> opinion

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it within this video but in my opinion

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.080 
it within this video but in my opinion
it<00:03:05.200> works<00:03:05.500> very<00:03:06.010> well<00:03:06.220> now<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.790> additional

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
it works very well now the additional

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.910 
it works very well now the additional
features<00:03:07.660> here<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.960> do<00:03:08.110> have<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.350> ability<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
features here we do have the ability to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580 
features here we do have the ability to
hide<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.520> option<00:03:10.030> bar<00:03:10.210> and<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.200> this

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
hide the option bar and that is this

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.440 
hide the option bar and that is this
little<00:03:11.770> bar<00:03:12.070> right<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.700> at<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> top<00:03:13.240> which

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
little bar right here at the top which

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.170 
little bar right here at the top which
allows<00:03:13.750> us<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.260> dial<00:03:14.830> an<00:03:15.070> emergency<00:03:15.670> call<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
allows us to dial an emergency call and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.330 
allows us to dial an emergency call and
then<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.750> also<00:03:16.930> allows<00:03:17.320> us<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.530> exit<00:03:18.160> out<00:03:18.310> of

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
then it also allows us to exit out of

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.970 
then it also allows us to exit out of
the<00:03:18.610> pattern<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.900> grid<00:03:20.170> right<00:03:20.470> there<00:03:20.710> so

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
the pattern little grid right there so

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.130 
the pattern little grid right there so
if<00:03:21.130> we<00:03:21.220> go<00:03:21.340> ahead<00:03:21.460> and<00:03:21.700> enter<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.600> pattern<00:03:23.020> in

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
if we go ahead and enter the pattern in

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.040 
if we go ahead and enter the pattern in
here<00:03:23.350> inside<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.220> these<00:03:24.730> settings<00:03:25.210> let's<00:03:25.900> go

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
here inside of these settings let's go

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.400 
here inside of these settings let's go
back<00:03:26.290> into<00:03:26.470> pattern<00:03:26.890> unlock<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:28.020> if<00:03:29.020> we<00:03:29.170> turn

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
back into pattern unlock and if we turn

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.040 
back into pattern unlock and if we turn
off<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.770> option<00:03:30.490> bar<00:03:30.670> you'll<00:03:31.150> see<00:03:31.240> that<00:03:31.570> those

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
off the option bar you'll see that those

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.440 
off the option bar you'll see that those
options<00:03:32.470> actually<00:03:32.880> disappear<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.210> do<00:03:34.330> not

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
options actually disappear so we do not

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.310 
options actually disappear so we do not
have<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.990> bar<00:03:35.260> there<00:03:35.620> anymore<00:03:36.060> now<00:03:37.060> also<00:03:37.420> you

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
have that bar there anymore now also you

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.620 
have that bar there anymore now also you
can<00:03:38.470> leave<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.890> option<00:03:39.250> bar<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.580> but<00:03:40.090> disable

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
can leave the option bar on but disable

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.930 
can leave the option bar on but disable
the<00:03:40.720> emergency<00:03:41.380> call<00:03:41.650> button<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.460> if<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.820> go

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the emergency call button so if you go

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.670 
the emergency call button so if you go
back<00:03:43.090> out<00:03:43.210> to<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.510> lock<00:03:43.690> screen<00:03:44.020> you'll<00:03:44.620> see

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
back out to the lock screen you'll see

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.590 
back out to the lock screen you'll see
that<00:03:44.800> we<00:03:45.010> do<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.400> ability<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.790> close<00:03:46.300> out

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
that we do have the ability to close out

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.660 
that we do have the ability to close out
of<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.870> pattern<00:03:47.080> grid<00:03:47.470> but<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.190> do<00:03:48.340> not<00:03:48.460> have

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
of the pattern grid but you do not have

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.510 
of the pattern grid but you do not have
the<00:03:48.790> SOS<00:03:49.330> option<00:03:49.810> over<00:03:50.080> here<00:03:50.350> anymore<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:51.490> the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
the SOS option over here anymore now the

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.580 
the SOS option over here anymore now the
last<00:03:51.820> option<00:03:52.030> down<00:03:52.420> here<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.170> ability<00:03:53.560> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
last option down here is the ability to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.170 
last option down here is the ability to
block<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.190> device<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.610> as<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.910> notes<00:03:55.060> here

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
block the device and as it notes here

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.660 
block the device and as it notes here
when<00:03:55.720> enabled<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.890> pattern<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.370> entered

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
when enabled and the pattern is entered

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.310 
when enabled and the pattern is entered
incorrectly<00:03:57.880> too<00:03:58.390> often<00:03:58.720> your<00:03:58.840> device<00:03:59.110> will

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
incorrectly too often your device will

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.020 
incorrectly too often your device will
be<00:03:59.410> blocked<00:03:59.680> this<00:03:59.980> blocking<00:04:00.430> behavior<00:04:00.880> is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
be blocked this blocking behavior is

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.150 
be blocked this blocking behavior is
identical<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:02.020> standard<00:04:02.130> passcode<00:04:03.130> lock

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
identical to the standard passcode lock

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.120 
identical to the standard passcode lock
so<00:04:04.150> basically<00:04:04.990> when<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.290> enter<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.770> in<00:04:05.890> wrong

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so basically when you enter it in wrong

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.180 
so basically when you enter it in wrong
enough<00:04:06.670> as<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.910> would<00:04:07.660> on<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.020> standard<00:04:08.860> iOS

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
enough as you would on the standard iOS

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.640 
enough as you would on the standard iOS
passcode<00:04:09.910> lock<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.990> actually<00:04:11.380> get<00:04:11.530> that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
passcode lock you actually get that

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.080 
passcode lock you actually get that
wrong<00:04:11.890> pattern<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.430> eventually<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.060> will

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
wrong pattern and eventually it will

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.360 
wrong pattern and eventually it will
lock<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.750> out<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.800> device<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.280> you'll

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
lock you out of the device and you'll

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.490 
lock you out of the device and you'll
have<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.640> wait<00:04:15.820> X<00:04:16.150> amount<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.870> minutes<00:04:17.200> to

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
have to wait X amount of minutes to

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.580 
have to wait X amount of minutes to
re-enter<00:04:18.460> the<00:04:18.700> pattern<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.350> pretty

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
re-enter the pattern so that is a pretty

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.470 
re-enter the pattern so that is a pretty
cool<00:04:20.770> security<00:04:21.310> feature<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:22.000> like<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.270> said

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
cool security feature but like I said

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.210 
cool security feature but like I said
this<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> very<00:04:23.140> impressive<00:04:23.410> tweak<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:24.010> works

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
this is a very impressive tweak it works

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.970 
this is a very impressive tweak it works
very<00:04:24.669> well<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.870> definitely<00:04:26.500> go<00:04:26.680> ahead<00:04:26.710> and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
very well and I definitely go ahead and

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.480 
very well and I definitely go ahead and
