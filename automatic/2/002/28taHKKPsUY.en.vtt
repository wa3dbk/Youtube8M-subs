the<00:00:09.150> whole<00:00:09.360> body<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.960> more<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
the whole body it's more of a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.070 
the whole body it's more of a
streamlined<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:11.460> well<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:13.019> can

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
streamlined as well because you can

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
streamlined as well because you can
imagine<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.650> more<00:00:13.830> aerodynamic<00:00:14.040> because

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
imagine it's more aerodynamic because

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.930 
imagine it's more aerodynamic because
like<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.299> airplane<00:00:15.660> still<00:00:16.260> running<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.100> top

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
like an airplane still running at top

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.080 
speed
it<00:00:18.779> meets<00:00:19.050> less<00:00:19.500> resistant<00:00:20.279> against<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> wind

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
it meets less resistant against the wind

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
it meets less resistant against the wind
that's<00:00:21.660> why<00:00:21.779> even<00:00:21.900> when<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.500> them

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that's why even when you see them

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439 
that's why even when you see them
they're<00:00:22.830> almost<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.430> slightly<00:00:23.789> lower<00:00:24.119> when

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they're almost or slightly lower when

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.429 
they're almost or slightly lower when
running<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.769> had<00:00:26.010> also<00:00:26.310> been<00:00:26.490> pointing

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
running so there had also been pointing

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
running so there had also been pointing
that<00:00:28.439> helps<00:00:28.800> quite<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.189> compared<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that helps quite a lot compared to the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
that helps quite a lot compared to the
leopard<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.380> has<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:31.980> Brown<00:00:32.640> face

cheetah is Bill mainly for speed and
antelopes<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> prey<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:40.620> will

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
antelopes which are the prey which will

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
antelopes which are the prey which will
always<00:00:41.190> attack<00:00:41.520> us<00:00:41.730> rabbits<00:00:42.239> smaller<00:00:43.079> impalas

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
always attack us rabbits smaller impalas

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.850 
always attack us rabbits smaller impalas
but<00:00:44.250> never<00:00:44.520> big<00:00:44.850> animals<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.960> zebras<00:00:45.989> or

but never big animals like zebras or
yellen's<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.840> rely<00:00:49.170> mainly<00:00:49.410> on

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
yellen's because they rely mainly on

yellen's because they rely mainly on
sweet<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> kick<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.079> this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
sweet and if they get a kick on this

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
very fragile legs they break a leg they

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
very fragile legs they break a leg they
know<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:57.149> can't

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
know they do to that because they can't

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.270 
know they do to that because they can't
hunt<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:02.160> notice<00:01:03.030> also<00:01:03.300> another<00:01:03.629> thing

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
hunt and notice also another thing

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
hunt and notice also another thing
compared<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> leopard<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.619> cheetah

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
compared to that leopard the cheetah

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.090 
compared to that leopard the cheetah
will<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.790> spots<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.780> leopard<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.860> have

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
will have more spots a leopard will have

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.850 
will have more spots a leopard will have
mothered<00:01:11.580> rosettes<00:01:12.210> pattern<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> more

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
mothered rosettes pattern will be more

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
mothered rosettes pattern will be more
of<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.070> almost<00:01:14.520> breaking<00:01:14.880> away<00:01:15.119> Seco<00:01:15.570> that's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of like almost breaking away Seco that's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.679 
of like almost breaking away Seco that's
on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> leopard<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.240> said<00:01:18.479> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
on the leopard and also like I said with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.899 
on the leopard and also like I said with
their<00:01:18.930> head<00:01:19.170> you'll<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.280> their<00:01:20.460> cheetah<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
their head you'll see their cheetah is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
their head you'll see their cheetah is
more<00:01:21.180> point<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> cheetah

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
more point here and also the cheetah

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.980 
more point here and also the cheetah
will<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.580> black<00:01:23.820> tears<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.540> down<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
will have the black tears going down the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
will have the black tears going down the
face<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.470> well<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> leopard<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.210> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
face as well the leopard will be just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
face as well the leopard will be just
more<00:01:27.659> run<00:01:28.020> built<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.939> strength

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
more run built also for strength

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
more run built also for strength
climbing<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> trees<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.409> lapper<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
climbing up the trees a lapper is it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
climbing up the trees a lapper is it
kills<00:01:32.850> prey<00:01:33.150> takes<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> tree

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
kills prey takes it up on the tree

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 
kills prey takes it up on the tree
cheaters<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.369> usually<00:01:35.640> still<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
cheaters will usually still have it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.929 
cheaters will usually still have it
below<00:01:36.780> underground<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.829> try<00:01:38.040> Tierra<00:01:38.369> they

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
below underground so try Tierra they

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819 
below underground so try Tierra they
kill<00:01:39.299> more<00:01:39.570> regularly<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
kill more regularly that's what you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.700 
kill more regularly that's what you
always<00:01:41.070> find<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:42.150> orphanage<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.990> cheetahs

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
always find more orphanage of cheetahs

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.730 
always find more orphanage of cheetahs
than<00:01:43.950> any<00:01:44.220> other<00:01:44.540> animals<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:46.290> why<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.619> if

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
than any other animals that's why we if

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
than any other animals that's why we if
there<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.520> got<00:01:47.670> different<00:01:48.000> projects<00:01:48.390> like

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
there you got different projects like

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179 
there you got different projects like
they're<00:01:48.720> developed<00:01:49.200> either<00:01:49.350> project<00:01:50.009> were

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
they're developed either project were

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
they're developed either project were
also<00:01:50.729> when<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.899> cheetah<00:01:52.170> girls<00:01:52.409> into

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
also when if a cheetah girls into

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
also when if a cheetah girls into
somebody's<00:01:53.189> fun<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> kills<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
somebody's fun and it kills the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.950 
somebody's fun and it kills the
livestock<00:01:55.399> what<00:01:56.399> they'll<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.119> they'll

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
livestock what they'll do is they'll

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
livestock what they'll do is they'll
call<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.950> project<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:00.750> come

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
call the project then they can then come

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.070 
call the project then they can then come
and<00:02:01.439> observe<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.369> risk

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
and observe it and risk

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.000 
and observe it and risk
I'm<00:02:03.380> killing<00:02:03.620> it<00:02:04.090> because<00:02:05.090> then<00:02:05.270> they<00:02:05.420> can<00:02:05.600> be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
I'm killing it because then they can be

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.490 
I'm killing it because then they can be
rewarded<00:02:07.010> also<00:02:07.610> for<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.720> livestock<00:02:09.200> which

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
rewarded also for the livestock which

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
rewarded also for the livestock which
they've<00:02:09.740> lost<00:02:10.009> saving<00:02:10.759> their<00:02:10.940> land<00:02:11.150> are<00:02:11.330> the

they've lost saving their land are the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:55.980

a<00:03:17.980> lion<00:03:18.190> carries<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.850> Y<00:03:19.030> gene<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:20.260> that's<00:03:20.470> part

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
a lion carries the Y gene so that's part

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.410 
a lion carries the Y gene so that's part
of<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.920> research<00:03:21.340> which<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.580> happening<00:03:22.209> here

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
of the research which is happening here

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.990 
of the research which is happening here
to<00:03:22.600> Petula<00:03:23.080> because<00:03:24.010> station<00:03:24.250> pure<00:03:24.610> compared

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
to Petula because station pure compared

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.180 
to Petula because station pure compared
to<00:03:25.150> L<00:03:25.270> elephant<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:29.260> now<00:03:29.590> look<00:03:29.890> at<00:03:30.040> this

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to L elephant and now look at this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.580 
to L elephant and now look at this
