00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.290
 because we do not want to find them the greatest common divisor of firefighters 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.480
 140 and 160 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.080
 the greatest common factor is the largest number that can divide the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.950
 numbers 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.979
 in case it was necessary 3 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.260
 for example let's see 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.029
 Let's see 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.499
 that we can both be divided between two 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.810
 well the poles could go among others 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 but possibly we make the biggest number khedira 140 and 112 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.039
 this personal information how are we going to do 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.260
 let's find something that is the prime factorization 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.340
 the items the prime factorization is puskar the prime numbers that give us 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.440
 multiplied to 140 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 to 112 then here we will see 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.870
 when I wrote the number 140 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 I'm going to write here 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 and then I'm going to dividends 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.560
 you can not search for one of your numbers and attributes 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.330
 the 2 7 estimated and how this number 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.700
 is very capable today evident 2 and followed 140 between the then goal 70 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.930
 his two by 70 nothing sorry for him 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.240
 mier and directors 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.399
 among others the detainees 15 2 and now 35 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.520
 then it's not true that I'm having cousins ​​here these are no longer 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 monfortinos questioned what move this iron more 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910
 the numbers that are not cousins ​​searched 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.760
 until it is shown 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.359
 Now 35 can dividends in which 2 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.730
 in 7 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.659
 and in 5 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.100
 and those numbers are also cousins ​​then at 140 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.370
 can describe it as 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.760
 two 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.470
 for you 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.150
 in case this one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.720
 For five 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.770
 Well, that cessation of 140 factors is a crime 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.870
 now I'm going to look for the 112 in factoring premiums too 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.910
 I have the one that the 112 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.590
 I divide it between two because it is also 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.820
 the injured this number nothing is found icex 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.440
 then the 56 9 and other centers 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 and now it gives me 28 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.849
 the 28 lived after two because it is also peace 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.449
 gin 14 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.089
 george 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.369
 July 14 others 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.569
 what quinteros 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.519
 and this number 7 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.519
 Then I can not write 112 as 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.319
 for you 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.339
 by all 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.889
 this 2 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.149
 for again twice we have 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.399
 for 7 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.059
 is this yep 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.469
 until now 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.729
 I will describe these numbers I will not put more next to each other 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 to see what we have in common 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 if they remember we had 140 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.829
 we have yes in your 40 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.369
 what was it 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:58.419
 two 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.789
 by two 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.039
 for 7 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.039
 for five and we also have the 112 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.419
 what was it 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.569
 two 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.799
 for you 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.189
 by all 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.649
 by two and by the way you're from your salary 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.609
 the firefighters but written on paper and you feel 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.799
 I'm going to take 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.039
 the numbers that are in common for both 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.529
 for example 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.029
 this 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.059
 this number 2 right-handed 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.869
 they are in both 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.659
 this 2 and this two also 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.189
 then this one 7 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.649
 that that number that continue at 140 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.779
 he took it and kiki way he took from here 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.049
 and then the 5 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.059
 is no longer in the 12 and then the 2 are not in 140 the 2 also not up to 140 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.859
 then he took nothing else 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.099
 the numbers to be in both 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.769
 I'm going to write you here 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.570
 the min 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.430
 maximum 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.129
 common 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.579
 I spot 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.939
 of 140 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.219
 and 112 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.689
 It does not matter 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.659
 two 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.679
 is this 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.910
 for another two 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.659
 is this 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.889
 a 7 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.479
 that exists that is here and they are together 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.219
 and that number is 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.889
 2 for 2 4 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.849
 and the four times seven are 28 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.849
 then the greatest common divisor 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.300
 in 140 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.789
 and 112 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.020
 is equal to 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.279
 28 what does that mean 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.900
 this is the biggest number 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.050
 that can divide the two firefighters without leaving waste 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.879
 the number two 2 can live 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.039
 the number four also the number 14 also 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.250
 but the biggest number of all that can divide us teachers without 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.680
 leave waste 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.080
 the number 20 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.949
 this is the common maximum spotted 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:53.800
 See you next time
