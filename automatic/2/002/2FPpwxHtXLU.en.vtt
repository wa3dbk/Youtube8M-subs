but<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.859> happens<00:00:08.130> over<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> last<00:00:08.490> three

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
but as it happens over the last three

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.709 
but as it happens over the last three
years<00:00:08.849> I've<00:00:09.030> been<00:00:09.120> thinking<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> lot<00:00:09.570> about

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
years I've been thinking a lot about

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.060 
years I've been thinking a lot about
this<00:00:10.050> question<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:10.590> I've<00:00:10.710> been<00:00:10.830> trying

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this question because I've been trying

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.799 
this question because I've been trying
to<00:00:11.190> write<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> novel<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.420> means<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to write a novel about what it means to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.810 
to write a novel about what it means to
be<00:00:12.929> human<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.469> how<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.650> define<00:00:14.040> personhood

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
be human and how we define personhood

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.609 
be human and how we define personhood
and<00:00:14.969> why<00:00:15.150> those<00:00:15.360> definitions<00:00:15.990> matter<00:00:16.350> I've

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and why those definitions matter I've

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.140 
and why those definitions matter I've
also<00:00:16.800> been<00:00:16.949> writing<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.580> tortoises

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
also been writing a lot about tortoises

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
also been writing a lot about tortoises
but<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:18.480> less<00:00:18.660> directly<00:00:19.109> relevant<00:00:19.590> here

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
but that's less directly relevant here

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.290 
but that's less directly relevant here
all<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.730> find<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
all right so first off I find all the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000 
all right so first off I find all the
like<00:00:21.449> biological<00:00:21.960> definitions<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
like biological definitions of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
like biological definitions of
humaneness<00:00:23.369> completely<00:00:24.210> uninteresting

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
humaneness completely uninteresting

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
humaneness completely uninteresting
because<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.640> that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
because we all kind of just know that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
because we all kind of just know that
there's<00:00:27.180> something<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.810> personhood<00:00:28.500> other

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
there's something to personhood other

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
there's something to personhood other
than<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.429> being<00:00:29.820> members<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> same

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
than just all being members of the same

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
than just all being members of the same
species<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> partly

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
species right like we know this partly

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
species right like we know this partly
because<00:00:32.430> most<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.000> us<00:00:33.120> believe<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> humans

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
because most of us believe that humans

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
because most of us believe that humans
have<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> seemingly<00:00:34.559> unique<00:00:35.100> consciousness<00:00:35.880> or

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
have a seemingly unique consciousness or

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850 
have a seemingly unique consciousness or
soul<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.750> whatever<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.829> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
soul or whatever but we also know that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
soul or whatever but we also know that
personhood<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.760> than<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.210> species

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
personhood is more than just a species

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.569 
personhood is more than just a species
category<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.710> constantly<00:00:41.190> see

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
category because we can constantly see

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
category because we can constantly see
people<00:00:41.610> denying<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.989> people's<00:00:43.500> humanity

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
people denying other people's humanity

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
people denying other people's humanity
even<00:00:44.489> though<00:00:44.640> we're<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:44.969> members<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.390> the

even though we're all members of the

even though we're all members of the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
same species this happens on a macro

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.950 
same species this happens on a macro
level<00:00:47.700> when<00:00:47.940> governments<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.660> instance

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
level when governments for instance

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
level when governments for instance
refused<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> acknowledge<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.070> very

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
refused to acknowledge the very

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
refused to acknowledge the very

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
existence of certain ethnic minorities

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
existence of certain ethnic minorities
and<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> happens<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> micro<00:00:53.910> level<00:00:54.090> every

it's<00:00:58.920> easy<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> understand<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
it's easy for me to understand that I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's easy for me to understand that I
contain<00:01:00.870> multitudes<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.649> rather<00:01:01.829> than

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
contain multitudes but rather than

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
contain multitudes but rather than
understanding<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.940> other<00:01:03.120> people<00:01:03.539> too

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
understanding that of other people too

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469 
understanding that of other people too
often<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.260> imagine<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> merely<00:01:05.700> sick<00:01:06.210> or

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
often I imagine them as merely sick or

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.950 
often I imagine them as merely sick or
merely<00:01:07.049> poor<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.799> merely<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.720> us

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
merely poor or merely them to some us

that includes me take for me at least
the<00:01:12.060> deeper<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> dig<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.049> harder<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> becomes

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the deeper I dig the harder it becomes

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
the deeper I dig the harder it becomes
to<00:01:14.040> understand<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.939> makes<00:01:15.150> people<00:01:15.479> people

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to understand what makes people people

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.300 
to understand what makes people people
for<00:01:16.320> instance<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.680> often<00:01:16.920> hear<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.159> what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
for instance I often hear that what

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
for instance I often hear that what
makes<00:01:17.520> us<00:01:17.670> human<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.570> share

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
makes us human is that we can share

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.870 
makes us human is that we can share
stories<00:01:19.380> across<00:01:19.710> generations<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> do

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
stories across generations and I do

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
stories across generations and I do
absolutely<00:01:21.780> believe<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> power<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
absolutely believe in the power of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.200 
absolutely believe in the power of
narrative<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:23.700> many<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:24.000> who

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
narrative but there are many people who

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
narrative but there are many people who
can't<00:01:24.570> tell<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.170> hear<00:01:25.409> stories<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.979> people

less alone in our grief and in our joy
basically<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> believe<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.769> we're<00:03:04.920> human

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
basically I believe that we're human

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
basically I believe that we're human
because<00:03:05.580> we<00:03:05.730> believe<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.360> each<00:03:06.510> other's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
because we believe in each other's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
because we believe in each other's
humaneness<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.830> because<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.550> listen<00:03:09.030> and

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
humaneness and because we can listen and

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.270 
humaneness and because we can listen and
we<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.600> work<00:03:09.840> together<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.530> alleviate<00:03:11.100> each

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
we can work together to alleviate each

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
other's suffering and in that sense I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.360 
other's suffering and in that sense I
guess<00:03:13.050> being<00:03:13.290> human<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.709> both<00:03:13.890> something<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
guess being human is both something that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.400 
guess being human is both something that
we<00:03:14.519> are<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.180> something<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:15.930> must<00:03:16.140> always

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
we are and something that we must always

we are and something that we must always
