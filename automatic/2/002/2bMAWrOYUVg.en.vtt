00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.289 
couldn't do before
those<00:03:49.040> are<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.519> days<00:03:49.760> before<00:03:49.909> MIDI

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
those are the in the days before MIDI

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.719 
those are the in the days before MIDI
certainly<00:03:51.260> before<00:03:51.379> computers<00:03:52.010> for<00:03:52.430> making

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
certainly before computers for making

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.729 
certainly before computers for making
music<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.870> was<00:03:53.959> really<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.169> first<00:03:54.409> time

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
music so that was really the first time

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.140 
music so that was really the first time
you<00:03:54.889> could<00:03:55.010> have<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.159> sequencer<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.849> drum

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
you could have a sequencer a drum

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.729 
you could have a sequencer a drum
machine<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.389> a<00:03:56.540> synthesizer<00:03:57.079> that<00:03:57.500> was<00:03:57.620> the

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
machine and a synthesizer that was the

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.500 
machine and a synthesizer that was the
overtime<00:03:57.949> syste<00:03:58.400> system<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.909> overtime<00:03:59.120> some

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
overtime syste system the overtime some

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.330 
overtime syste system the overtime some
pre<00:03:59.840> MIDI<00:04:00.019> right<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.739> were<00:04:00.859> connected

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
pre MIDI right they were connected

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.649 
pre MIDI right they were connected
together<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.729> you<00:04:01.879> could<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.510> could

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
together and you could you could

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.460 
together and you could you could
actually<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:02.989> everything<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:03.979> sync<00:04:04.849> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
actually have everything in sync and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.259 
actually have everything in sync and
compose<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:07.099> know<00:04:07.189> make<00:04:07.549> music<00:04:08.030> with<00:04:08.239> a

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
compose and you know make music with a

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.530 
compose and you know make music with a
with<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.169> system<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:09.709> by<00:04:09.799> playing<00:04:10.579> on<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.000> and

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
with a system just by playing on it and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.199 
with a system just by playing on it and
and<00:04:12.470> then<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.859> remember<00:04:13.220> hearing<00:04:13.549> about<00:04:13.790> work

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
and then I remember hearing about work

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.899 
and then I remember hearing about work
you<00:04:14.359> did<00:04:14.829> post<00:04:15.829> over<00:04:16.130> on<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.400> were<00:04:16.519> designing

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
you did post over on you were designing

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.939 
you did post over on you were designing
products<00:04:17.329> for<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.539> companies<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.229> some<00:04:18.859> of

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
products for the companies and some of

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:19.960 
products for the companies and some of
those<00:04:19.009> some<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.310> these<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.549> think<00:04:19.579> they<00:04:19.820> will<00:04:19.909> be

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
those some of these I think they will be

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.759 
those some of these I think they will be
surprisingly<00:04:20.599> groundbreaking<00:04:21.289> products

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
surprisingly groundbreaking products

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.940 
surprisingly groundbreaking products

with some other great engineers and we
really<00:04:29.509> enjoyed<00:04:29.810> doing<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.770> synthesizer

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
really enjoyed doing the synthesizer

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.540 
really enjoyed doing the synthesizer

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
advanced music technology but we didn't

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.610 
advanced music technology but we didn't
want<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.360> deal<00:04:56.360> with<00:04:56.389> all<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.900> other<00:04:57.080> aspects

real bold ideas and we'd worked on a lot
of<00:06:30.979> great<00:06:31.280> technology<00:06:31.610> but<00:06:32.389> it's<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:33.229> took<00:06:33.560> I

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
of great technology but it's it took I

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.730 
of great technology but it's it took I
took<00:06:34.280> a<00:06:34.340> lot<00:06:34.490> of<00:06:34.520> guts<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:35.060> to<00:06:35.900> say<00:06:36.080> no<00:06:36.260> let's

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
took a lot of guts to to say no let's

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.459 
took a lot of guts to to say no let's
let's<00:06:37.190> make<00:06:37.340> a<00:06:37.400> digital<00:06:37.760> tape<00:06:37.909> recorder

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
let's make a digital tape recorder
