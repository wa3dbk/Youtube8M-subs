00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello, I'm the genius of the passionate genius 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.799
 e-commerce and today we will 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 talk about how to build a virtual 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.160
 clothes and fashion 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.160
 If you want to know more, stay in the same 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.320
 Good, we 'll talk about riding. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 a virtual store to sell clothes and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.140
 fashion 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.300
 the report said the WebShoppers 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.619
 beach fashion 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.790
 if I'm not mistaken for the third or fourth 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 consecutive year is the sector that sells the most 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.480
 products online today this is very cool 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.829
 because when I started working on 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 internet is not the first virtual store 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.239
 I worked exactly in this sector. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 I was selling women's accessories 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.149
 Internet 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 and at that time not many people yet 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.180
 this prejudice is how I go 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.180
 buy without trying how I 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.199
 I will buy without seeing the product so I 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 I believe this is getting 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.030
 been improving is not every 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.060
 decreasing this type of prejudice 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.189
 so much for the surprise issue, right? 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 surprise at the positioning 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.140
 I have achieved is several years 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.979
 maintaining leadership in the amount of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 sales 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.580
 This is how you can act by selling 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 internet as is a big market 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.579
 large brands operate in diverse 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.490
 This has a fair nexus of 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 fitch that sell many products that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 they sell reputed brands 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.320
 so the question is how the little one is going 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 differentiate itself in this market as the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 small will be able to act in that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 Marketplace 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 I think that for you to sell fashion online 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.600
 you need to specialize in the trash if 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.420
 specialize in a fashion type there are 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 various tribes there are several styles 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.619
 in Brazil and in the world that are not 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.079
 attended by major brands 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.770
 so I see that there is a great 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.569
 market that small 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.510
 specialize the little ones who want to 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.440
 start working on the internet 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.710
 they need 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.770
 to choose a niche market any 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.350
 some sector is a style something that 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.040
 everything becomes specialized that everything is 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.650
 Be the best at what you do. 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.840
 in what is your best in the port does 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.940
 that specific niche here and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.430
 not only have the best products not have 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.990
 only the lowest price but pinto understand 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.270
 those people who buy and consume 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.730
 that kind of product that everyone knows 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.680
 where they live, know what they are 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.630
 consume as they speak as they 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.910
 relate that songs from the album as 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.760
 where they do not what holidays they go to 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.090
 men travel so I can hit 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.150
 can you talk, can you speak? 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.440
 language and the challenges for those who work 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.940
 with fashion today on the internet are me 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.320
 achieve customer loyalty not 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.990
 get that guy to buy from 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.820
 ti more times at a time when there is no 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.950
 specific niche of the day becomes a 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.710
 reference in this sector is much more 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.630
 easy, everyone can do this 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.360
 Another challenge is the exchange 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.970
 question of experiencing the issue of 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.340
 if the product is not the time that you 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.690
 also specialize you start to create 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.720
 relationship with these clients and this 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.850
 facilitates the process of exchange the process 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.630
 So that we know your brand 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.450
 so besides all the great challenge is 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.400
 differentiate is and follow this 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.459
 strategy of serving a niche meet 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.739

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.489
