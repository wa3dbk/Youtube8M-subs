00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.139
 and 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.630
 he is oswaldo alanÃ­s another of the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.480
 chivas reinforcements for the opening 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.939
 2015 we know the importance of what 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.670
 it's chivas we know how much weight they have 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.120
 as a club and as an institution and at 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.090
 mexico internationally 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.450
 as it says it comes from that the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 things that stays champion that they have 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.420
 certain achievements and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.430
 and that gives you to get more motivated 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 to try to bring the team 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.590
 what what one can to try to 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.270
 add and always think about that in which 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.190
 can get better things and we're going to 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.240
 try to keep doing it in the club 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.090
 that this is to fight like that 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.020
 as he says is Pedro is very demanding and he 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.280
 way work also demands it so 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.880
 I also think that chepo also works 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.700
 A) Yes 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.860
 the club deserves it and as I tell you to be 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.310
 a large Mexican background at a 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.450
 international merits to reach large 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.950
 things get to joy in first 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 save yourself from the decline that we are 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 fighting but but without thinking so much about 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 that and rather in making a good tournament 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.570
 be born 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 a good role to reach a group and think 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 in bigger things that I think the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 football and all the life you follow you get 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's something and you always have to think that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.689
 the next stage has to be key 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.759
 the best you are with pure companion 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.030
 Mexican in with pure compatriot out there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.250
 could the player also stand out 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.830
 Mexico level because I believe that all the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 campus to were selection then yes 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.590
 it's a pride if it's clear that what you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.439
 motivate and that you 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.750
 who also commits you to work more 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.729
 longed for and to try to have better 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.799
 very results is delivered a 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.899
 professionalism try to leave everything in 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.210
 the court and off also because a 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.340
 footballer what makes a court the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.280
 reflection of what he trains and also sees 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.730
 how he lives his life and how he manages 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.010
 then we will try to give everything 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.019
 of what of my disability and let's hope 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.569
 be a lot but what of a disability 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.989
 contribute only to the team and that it serves 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.989
 peeping 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.750
