the dell tour on the lambda complete

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.470 
the dell tour on the lambda complete
their<00:02:47.230> 110<00:02:47.650> simple<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:48.849> are<00:02:48.939> seven<00:02:49.209> spoke

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
their 110 simple there are seven spoke

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.020 
their 110 simple there are seven spoke
yeah<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.129> they<00:02:51.129> get<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> job<00:02:51.579> done<00:02:51.609> nice

break this one comes to the simple the
flatter<00:02:58.720> flex<00:02:59.379> offender<00:02:59.620> break<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.970> I

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
flatter flex offender break so I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.250 
flatter flex offender break so I
something<00:03:01.480> around<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:01.810> one<00:03:01.930> like<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.139> other

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
something around it one like the other

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.619 
something around it one like the other
deck<00:03:02.500> has<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.950> lambda<00:03:03.250> deck<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:03.760> still<00:03:04.510> it's

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
deck has the lambda deck but still it's

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.210 
deck has the lambda deck but still it's
flexing<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.079> great<00:03:05.230> keep<00:03:05.439> the<00:03:05.560> dial<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.980> works

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
flexing to great keep the dial it works

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.789 
flexing to great keep the dial it works
nice<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:08.079> overall<00:03:08.919> the<00:03:09.250> scooter<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.609> 195<00:03:10.769> be<00:03:11.769> a
