but<00:00:00.179> we're<00:00:00.299> gonna<00:00:00.390> do<00:00:00.599> with<00:00:00.750> that<00:00:00.780> two

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
but we're gonna do with that two

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.630 
but we're gonna do with that two
teaspoons<00:00:02.070> full<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:03.049> to<00:00:04.049> our<00:00:04.640> distilled

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
teaspoons full of this to our distilled

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.530 
teaspoons full of this to our distilled
water<00:00:05.850> mixer<00:00:06.480> cover<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.620> plates<00:00:08.179> from<00:00:09.179> our

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
water mixer cover the plates from our

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.230 
water mixer cover the plates from our
hydrogen<00:00:09.929> generator<00:00:11.030> we're<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
hydrogen generator we're going to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.990 
hydrogen generator we're going to
introduce<00:00:12.450> 12<00:00:13.049> volts<00:00:13.410> end<00:00:13.590> up<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.820> right

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
introduce 12 volts end up here all right

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.800 
introduce 12 volts end up here all right
we'll<00:00:15.570> see<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:15.900> kind<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.500> polls<00:00:16.800> should

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
we'll see what kind of polls should

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.359 
we'll see what kind of polls should
crack<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> water<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:20.039> known<00:00:20.189> as

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
crack the water as it's known as

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.689 
crack the water as it's known as
cracking<00:00:20.970> water<00:00:21.150> yeah<00:00:21.990> use<00:00:22.590> two<00:00:23.430> parts

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
cracking water yeah use two parts

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:41.389 
cracking water yeah use two parts
hydrogen<00:00:23.820> part<00:00:24.779> oxygen<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:32.540> see

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:01:08.969 

if<00:00:42.399> you<00:00:42.460> can<00:00:42.610> hear<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> spark<00:01:08.500> arrestor

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
if you can hear like a spark arrestor

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.520 
if you can hear like a spark arrestor
now<00:01:09.970> if<00:01:10.270> we<00:01:10.450> ever<00:01:10.540> had<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.720> flat<00:01:10.990> from<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
now if we ever had a flat from the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.880 
now if we ever had a flat from the
engine<00:01:12.100> inside<00:01:13.000> here<00:01:13.360> at<00:01:13.479> this<00:01:13.600> bottle<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.590> go

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
engine inside here at this bottle we go

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.400 
engine inside here at this bottle we go
to<00:01:14.950> our<00:01:15.100> generator<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.869> can<00:01:20.020> hook<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.350> up

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
to our generator so you can hook it up

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.210 
to our generator so you can hook it up
to<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.649> car

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
to the car

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.680 
to the car
I<00:01:21.250> made<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.360> little<00:01:22.720> thing<00:01:23.560> here<00:01:24.210> hold<00:01:25.210> jars

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
I made this little thing here hold jars

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:39.300 
I made this little thing here hold jars
and<00:01:26.050> it<00:01:26.440> fits<00:01:26.679> just<00:01:26.800> perfectly<00:01:38.009> drawn<00:01:39.009> down

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
and it fits just perfectly drawn down

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.870 
and it fits just perfectly drawn down
about<00:01:39.550> six<00:01:39.909> six<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.570> quarter<00:01:40.750> amps<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
about six six and a quarter amps so this

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.309 
about six six and a quarter amps so this
is<00:01:43.259> relatively<00:01:44.259> cool<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:47.069> not<00:01:48.069> even<00:01:48.369> warm

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
is relatively cool and not even warm

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.979 
is relatively cool and not even warm
after<00:01:50.319> about<00:01:50.670> 50<00:01:51.670> pounds<00:01:51.880> right<00:01:52.300> now<00:01:52.630> it'll

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
after about 50 pounds right now it'll

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.690 
after about 50 pounds right now it'll
heal<00:01:53.229> pretty<00:01:53.649> good<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.009> we'll<00:01:54.099> check<00:01:54.459> it<00:01:54.610> out

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
heal pretty good so we'll check it out

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.460 
heal pretty good so we'll check it out
then<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.090> see<00:01:55.239> how<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.569> does<00:01:55.750> right<00:01:56.110> let's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
then and see how it does right let's

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:07.740 
then and see how it does right let's
open<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.979> car<00:02:05.429> into<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.459> top<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.149> air

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
open the car into the top of the air

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.100 
open the car into the top of the air
filter<00:02:08.020> here

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:28.199 

as<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:17.010> should<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.220> really<00:02:17.610> wrong

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.420 

so<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:29.330> got<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.989> from<00:02:30.290> our<00:02:30.439> generator<00:02:30.799> into

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so we got going from our generator into

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.670 
so we got going from our generator into
our<00:02:31.519> bubbler<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.959> right<00:02:33.170> into<00:02:33.319> our<00:02:33.379> area

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
our bubbler and right into our area

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.630 
our bubbler and right into our area
technically<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.810> engine<00:02:36.310> only<00:02:37.310> four

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
technically the engine only four

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.509 
technically the engine only four
horsepower<00:02:38.090> engine<00:02:38.689> this<00:02:39.620> thing<00:02:39.860> has<00:02:40.189> no

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
horsepower engine this thing has no

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:57.360 
horsepower engine this thing has no
oxygen<00:02:41.299> sensors<00:02:41.900> fool<00:02:42.319> so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.699 

now<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.520> this<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.209> an<00:02:59.450> older<00:02:59.840> engine<00:03:00.020> this

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
now because this is an older engine this

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.020 
now because this is an older engine this
is<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> six<00:03:01.370> volt<00:03:01.760> system<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.870> don't<00:03:03.590> think

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
is a six volt system I don't think

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.960 
is a six volt system I don't think
Volkswagen<00:03:05.349> until<00:03:06.349> 65<00:03:06.680> everything<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.730> six

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
Volkswagen until 65 everything in six

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:21.580 
Volkswagen until 65 everything in six
volts<00:03:08.330> well<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.270> system<00:03:20.590> for

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
volts well because this is a system for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.110 
volts well because this is a system for
the<00:03:21.650> roof<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.670> whole<00:03:22.849> nother<00:03:23.000> story

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
the roof but that's a whole nother story

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.700 
the roof but that's a whole nother story
but<00:03:24.019> we're<00:03:24.800> gonna<00:03:24.890> run<00:03:25.190> 12<00:03:25.519> volt
