00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.859
 Hello dear audience here is again 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.009
 montano crisis at the chemnitz already in 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.660
 seen our previous tv video 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.369
 I will become three citizens for you today 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.910
 eat here we have the double 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.650
 steakhouse berger burger king I will 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 now for you unpack and review 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.260
 hatz has seen this intro before 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.879
 Gleichberg are already there for you 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.870
 and montana where's his today 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.809
 burger session 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.229
 we just have to do that 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.489
 have brought hunger and 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.689
 now looks very happy too 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.549
 looks delicious in the intro video 

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.350
 I already have two layers of meat 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.059
 seen and then still on it 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.860
 we still have west onions tomatoes 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.799
 mayonnaise steakhouse barbecue sauce 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.790
 Cheese and cheese also responded 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.560
 nice lightweight software bun with 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.049
 have small meals in the season 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.420
 actually with sesame based exactly salad 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.670
 on it is synonymous on it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.329
 I would say I know pure gerber 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.490
 My job was also limited 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.159
 there is always a series of the memory again 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.499
 a little bit longer but still not 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.990
 Duration program many a research in the 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.909
 head, we have not focused on the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.439
 channel is as I said in the one with 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.670
 wine and its citizens always comes 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.280
 again and again and again it is cool 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.530
 actually in English reliable 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.119
 English misses many treasures too 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.889
 somewhere written in the comments 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.389
 does anyone have his favorite burger king 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.700
 Citizen tore open also directly 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:55.299
 said it definitely is and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.299
 the hop malt the bomb again 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.860
 so you can say well we are now 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:09.480
 The three train again properly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:14.160
 mountains plus fries we are so at 1600 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:20.430
 calories of the route so responsible to the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.610
 eight dogs fries big fries 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.060
 at least 500 clearly stated 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.810
 thus already at 1202 petty bourgeois respectively 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 300 man as I said myself at 1600 1800 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.330
 Calories per country often needs 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.040
 very fortunately no grief 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 So actually have a daily requirement for 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.830
 normal people with a meal 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.800
 slimmed the is indeed currently are 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.290
 we will just be in a corner 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.600
 really so it's somewhere the flight 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.490
 but ingo also a blessing for the other one 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.160
 Another is a definition phase 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.650
 of course stop but at the moment is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.370
 just the opposite and mass building it first 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.040
 sometimes important for us this sometimes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.470
 Luxury and good feeling not so much 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.120
 for we must eat definitely the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.610
 wrong some people say that for you 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.209
 and less to eat at all 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.280
 no way 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.900
 they force us in part so if you 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.030
 you from our perspective 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.730
 we have to eat some real food 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.100
 sometimes to bring in because you stop 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.570
 just want to pack weight and that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.340
 then I had really bad 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.770
 partly if you eat so two 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.310
 Hours Eat Eat Eat Already 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.220
 Describe badly uncertain taste 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.880
 for our dear viewers lace on 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.980
 the same very juicy too easy too 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.660
 dry yes what two days instead 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.080
 Meat can happen most of the time, yes 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.110
 fast 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:52.170
 cheese is very tender and creamier 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.940
 Toric salad is your responsibility 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.050
 think so so the bank for suse and 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.970
 the fried onions make that 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.820
 in the whole thing so special 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.100
 and is also not applicable version too 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.860
 find the right in us brought us 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.810
 in the motto bassal the onion rings 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.230
 accurate in care stream which is perhaps 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.380
 still horny I have to say what we 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.380
 say 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.970
 so i would say for me next to that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:26.050
 extra lokis and the slope of the xii to the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.480
 best stocks of burger king but from 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.660
 I would say 54 of film 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.300
 to keep in any case that the lid 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.090
 forgive did not win yes would say 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.300
 very very good four out of five spoons 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.280
 reviews just about everything 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.630
 yes then lets montana where the citizens 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.100
 still taste and we do then 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.030
 straight on we make as a purely 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.140
 upload bergischen series with montana and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.880
 the intro video is worth it today 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.370
 shoot directly for you so you already 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.900
 can look forward to it and I would say 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.900
 See you soon for the next review
