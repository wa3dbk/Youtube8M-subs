zombie<00:01:31.829> map<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> 4<00:01:32.990> multiplayer<00:01:33.990> maps<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
zombie map and a 4 multiplayer maps and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
zombie map and a 4 multiplayer maps and
then<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.220> gun<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.729> starting<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.270> more

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
then the gun it's starting to see more

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
then the gun it's starting to see more
feasible<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:38.100> saw<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> through

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
feasible like I really saw it through

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460 
feasible like I really saw it through
like<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.450> could<00:01:39.570> implement<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.259> did

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
like how they could implement it I did

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990 
like how they could implement it I did
that<00:01:40.590> video<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.340> somebody<00:01:41.549> comment<00:01:41.939> on

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that video and then somebody comment on

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
that video and then somebody comment on
that<00:01:42.119> video<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.079> they'll<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that video actually and they'll be on

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.649 
that video actually and they'll be on
the<00:01:43.470> screen<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:45.030> shane<00:01:45.329> collie

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the screen right now is by shane collie

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
the screen right now is by shane collie
and<00:01:45.960> he<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.259> much<00:01:46.380> said<00:01:46.680> he<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.250> diamond

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and he pretty much said he has diamond

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.660 
and he pretty much said he has diamond
camos<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.750> his<00:01:48.990> smgs<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.490> guys<00:01:50.610> don't

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
camos on his smgs so if you guys don't

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
camos on his smgs so if you guys don't
know<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.850> diamond<00:01:51.119> camo<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.110> where

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
know what diamond camo is it is where

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
know what diamond camo is it is where
you<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.829> gold<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> stuff

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you have to get gold and all that stuff

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
you have to get gold and all that stuff
on<00:01:54.090> every<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
on every one of that and like the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.310 
on every one of that and like the
specific<00:01:55.829> class<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.310> launchers<00:01:56.930> smgs<00:01:57.930> if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
specific class like launchers smgs if

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.270 
specific class like launchers smgs if
you<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.770> Jesus<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.189> to

you want have some Jesus you have to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.639 
you want have some Jesus you have to
have<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> SMGs<00:01:59.939> gold<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:01.049> really

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
have all the SMGs gold which is really

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.720 
have all the SMGs gold which is really
big<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
big of a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.900 
big of a
booche<00:02:03.000> um<00:02:03.330> but<00:02:04.200> yeah<00:02:04.980> it's<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.400> easy<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.790> do

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
booche um but yeah it's not easy to do

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.780 
booche um but yeah it's not easy to do
and<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:07.080> much<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.320> he<00:02:07.380> asked<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
and pretty much what he asked is this is

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.730 
and pretty much what he asked is this is
like<00:02:08.940> another<00:02:09.210> why<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:10.020> might<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.530> fake

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
like another why I it might be fake

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.560 
like another why I it might be fake
because<00:02:11.190> he<00:02:11.730> pretty<00:02:11.880> much<00:02:11.940> asked<00:02:12.210> how<00:02:12.420> they

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
because he pretty much asked how they

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.790 
because he pretty much asked how they
would<00:02:12.660> implement<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.320> they<00:02:13.410> added<00:02:13.710> an

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
would implement this if they added an

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
would implement this if they added an
SMG<00:02:14.040> would<00:02:14.430> he<00:02:14.850> still<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.060> diamond<00:02:15.420> camo

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
SMG would he still have diamond camo

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.690 
SMG would he still have diamond camo
because<00:02:15.870> essentially<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:17.100> second<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
because essentially that second that a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
because essentially that second that a
peacekeeper<00:02:18.480> comes<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:18.930> his<00:02:19.170> SMG<00:02:19.560> he

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
peacekeeper comes out for his SMG he

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.020 
peacekeeper comes out for his SMG he
technically<00:02:20.370> wouldn't<00:02:20.790> meet<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
technically wouldn't meet the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
technically wouldn't meet the
requirements<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.540> diamond<00:02:21.990> camo<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:23.460> what'd

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
requirements have diamond camo so what'd

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.390 
requirements have diamond camo so what'd
he<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.420> gain<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.350> Peacekeeper<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.220> that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
he have to gain the Peacekeeper on that

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
he have to gain the Peacekeeper on that
or<00:02:26.580> would<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.020> gold

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
or would it would you have to get gold

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.480 
or would it would you have to get gold
cam<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.830> Peacekeeper<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.340> down<00:02:29.460> a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
cam on the Peacekeeper to get down a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.980 
cam on the Peacekeeper to get down a
camo<00:02:29.820> wrote<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:31.010> still<00:02:32.010> give<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> him<00:02:32.460> so

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
camo wrote it I still give it to him so

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.290 
camo wrote it I still give it to him so
so<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.520> rationally<00:02:35.520> thought<00:02:35.700> about<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.090> in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
so I rationally thought about this in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.400 
so I rationally thought about this in
two<00:02:36.600> different<00:02:36.870> ways<00:02:38.810> essentially<00:02:39.810> what

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
two different ways essentially what

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.930 
two different ways essentially what
would<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> pretty<00:02:41.160> much<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.370> said<00:02:41.490> he<00:02:41.670> didn't

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
would I pretty much I said he didn't

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.790 
would I pretty much I said he didn't
read<00:02:42.060> meet<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.900> requirements<00:02:43.350> for<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.650> he

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
read meet the requirements for it so he

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.780 
read meet the requirements for it so he
would<00:02:43.920> no<00:02:44.070> longer<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.340> able<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.550> use<00:02:44.640> diamond

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
would no longer be able to use diamond

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.520 
would no longer be able to use diamond
camo<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.200> don't<00:02:46.290> feel<00:02:46.470> like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
camo and I really don't feel like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
camo and I really don't feel like
treyarch<00:02:47.100> would<00:02:47.280> do<00:02:47.490> something<00:02:47.820> like<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.000> um

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
treyarch would do something like that um

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.890 
treyarch would do something like that um
so<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.350> believe<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.950> would<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
so I believe it would be if it's the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.450 
so I believe it would be if it's the
only<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.200> original<00:02:52.290> guns<00:02:52.710> none<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> added

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
only the original guns none of the added

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.310 
only the original guns none of the added
guns<00:02:53.670> count<00:02:54.000> towards<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.390> diamond<00:02:54.660> camo<00:02:54.930> at<00:02:55.110> all

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
guns count towards a diamond camo at all

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.310 
guns count towards a diamond camo at all
uh<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.970> maybe<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:57.870> something<00:02:58.050> like<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
uh or maybe just like something like you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.300 
uh or maybe just like something like you
already<00:02:58.440> had<00:02:58.620> down<00:02:58.770> mccann<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
already had down mccann when you get to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.040 
already had down mccann when you get to
keep<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.180> believe<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.570> gonna<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.840> just

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
keep it but I believe it's gonna be just

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.900 
keep it but I believe it's gonna be just
the<00:03:01.230> standard<00:03:01.530> guns<00:03:01.740> came<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.550> game<00:03:02.700> if

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the standard guns came with the game if

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
more problems than I think adding a gun

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.390 
more problems than I think adding a gun
would<00:03:32.940> actually<00:03:33.330> really<00:03:33.510> want<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> bring<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.370> I

would actually really want to bring so I

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.220 
would actually really want to bring so I
believe<00:03:35.820> they're<00:03:36.030> going<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:36.750> its

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
believe they're going to do it as its

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.840 
believe they're going to do it as its
you<00:03:37.470> only<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.830> get<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.070> gun<00:03:38.220> stock<00:03:38.610> guns

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
you only have to get the gun stock guns

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.890 
you only have to get the gun stock guns
in<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> game<00:03:40.459> gold<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.790> get<00:03:41.940> diamond<00:03:42.239> camo<00:03:42.420> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
in the game gold to get diamond camo and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.600 
in the game gold to get diamond camo and
I<00:03:43.050> really<00:03:43.260> could<00:03:43.770> only<00:03:43.890> see<00:03:44.070> that's<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> only

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
I really could only see that's the only

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.250 
I really could only see that's the only
way<00:03:44.700> they're<00:03:44.880> doing<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.050> is

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
way they're doing that and then this is

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260 
way they're doing that and then this is
another<00:03:46.620> reason<00:03:46.739> why<00:03:47.100> like<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.970> when<00:03:48.209> you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
another reason why like this when you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.000 
another reason why like this when you
bring<00:03:48.450> up<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.630> topic<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.140> another<00:03:49.470> reason<00:03:49.680> my

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
bring up this topic is another reason my

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.100 
bring up this topic is another reason my
brain<00:03:50.280> start<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> think<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.090> go<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.870> fake<00:03:52.080> a

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
brain start to think I go this is fake a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.630 
brain start to think I go this is fake a
little<00:03:52.260> bit<00:03:52.500> because<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:53.010> just<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.400> it's

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
little bit because it's just like it's

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.390 
little bit because it's just like it's
it's<00:03:53.850> kind<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.630> difficult<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.110> do<00:03:55.470> in<00:03:55.709> like<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
it's kind of difficult to do in like the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.710 
it's kind of difficult to do in like the
concepts<00:03:56.880> about<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.239> are<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.360> little<00:03:57.540> bit

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
concepts about it are a little bit

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.180 
concepts about it are a little bit
strange<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:58.560> never<00:03:58.770> happened<00:03:59.160> before

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
strange and it's never happened before

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.310 
strange and it's never happened before
in<00:03:59.430> college<00:03:59.700> ID<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.780> honestly<00:04:01.080> nobody

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
in college ID so really honestly nobody

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.920 
in college ID so really honestly nobody
knows<00:04:01.650> at<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.370> point<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:03.120> I'm<00:04:03.330> gonna<00:04:03.660> give

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
knows at this point but I'm gonna give

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.449 
knows at this point but I'm gonna give
it<00:04:03.959> right<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:04.620> I'm<00:04:04.800> leaning<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
it right now I'm leaning on like a

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.130 
it right now I'm leaning on like a
seventy<00:04:05.910> percent<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.420> being<00:04:06.750> completely

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
seventy percent of this being completely

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.080 
seventy percent of this being completely
one<00:04:07.530> hundred<00:04:07.590> percent<00:04:07.800> true<00:04:08.160> because<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.000> just

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
one hundred percent true because it just

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.849 
one hundred percent true because it just
there's<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> lot<00:04:09.959> more<00:04:09.989> evidence<00:04:10.530> leading

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
there's a lot more evidence leading

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.289 
there's a lot more evidence leading
toward<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.519> true<00:04:11.549> it's<00:04:11.880> this

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
toward this to be true it's this

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.120 
toward this to be true it's this
happened<00:04:12.660> for
