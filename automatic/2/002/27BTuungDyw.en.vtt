 hello to the whole civil world and if we 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.330
 we find new spoilers on the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.550
 future minecraft pocket edition 0.1 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.930
 point 0 and good in all these spoiler 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.090
 I do not come taking less than tomás or 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.619
 developer of this pocket edition and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.930
 well the first spoiler is related 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 with the caves for the table bioma 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.029
 just like the desert biome and the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.919
 taiga mega tello exact will be generated 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.660
 caves in a natural way this does not happen 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.130
 previously as we see on screen a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 example is this that you are seeing in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.120
 old table as well as another 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 example in the negative and good biome 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.820
 also say that this is also 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.830
 implemented a version of fish in the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.180
 version 14 w 20 of implemented to this and 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.160
 a pocket edition version also goes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 to implement that both the table biome 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.230
 like the desert and the mega taiga 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.880
 have natural caves and good once 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 done this spoiler plus the next one and the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.970
 next spoiler related to the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 creation of the world to our new menu 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.200
 now to create world and we can establish 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 an advanced mode when creating 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.100
 our world at the time of editing that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 we can put three types of world is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 say an ancient world to explain what 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.990
 is this an infinite world 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.730
 the plane as in game or creative 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.860
 and we can also put the seed 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.700
 logically as it happens now 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.350
 but I'm going to explain what 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.420
 means the infinite world flash 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.070
 god the world today is basically like 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.320
 currently works minecraft the pocket 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.050
 edition 0.8 point 1 you know it is 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.970
 limited to a series of blocks now 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.860
 same I remember how many blocks are but 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.360
 you know that when a point arrives there is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.070
 empty and you can not keep walking 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.170
 I will be watching the screen image of 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.360
 this world today the old system of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 generation of the world the pocket edition and 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.320
 this system that will facilitate easy and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 pull old mobiles or tablet 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 old where you play with this time of 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.200
 editing that goes well because it takes 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
 it has been said that mobile phones that have 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.160
 just a processor core and they have 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.800
 below whoever is then of 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.990
 ram memory recommends that you create the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.820
 world of this kind the world or the world 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.649
 old and already if you have a model much 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.110
 better to say that it has more than one core and 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.640
 more than 512 megabytes of ram because you already 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 I recommend putting any kind of world 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.450
 both infinite and a flat goal that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 you want we go and basically that they do 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.470
 them that the 0.9 can be adapted so much 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.150
 advanced mobile like mobiles that do not 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.990
 are very advanced and makes everyone 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 can play 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.460
 person good idea as well people 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.990
 that has a very good mobile 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.730
 Look, you can keep playing and I think 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.620
 very correct on the part of very well that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.600
 have done this and people who have a 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.760
 new processor in the mobile and a lot 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.280
 ram can play like the worlds 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 infinite you know that is 09 go to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.880
 see infinite worlds saying is going to have 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.830
 a limit of blocks but gyan the 0.1 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.330
 of point one is going to put a limit of 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 blocks that are going to be 30,000 blocks of 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.680
 moment that is spoken but already know 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.860
