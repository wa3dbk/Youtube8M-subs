00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
you have to take into consideration how

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.249 
you have to take into consideration how
much<00:01:27.340> protein<00:01:27.700> X<00:01:28.090> getting<00:01:28.359> purser<00:01:28.780> being<00:01:29.049> so

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
much protein X getting purser being so

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.499

want<00:01:29.859> to<00:01:29.920> quickly<00:01:30.189> break<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.700> down<00:01:30.909> guys<00:01:31.179> I

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
want to quickly break that down guys I

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.089 
want to quickly break that down guys I
think<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.049> will<00:01:32.170> vary<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.500> little<00:01:32.709> bit<00:01:32.859> from

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
think this will vary a little bit from

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.649 
think this will vary a little bit from
flavor<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.609> flavor<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.270> shouldn't<00:01:34.569> be

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
flavor the flavor but it shouldn't be

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.599 
flavor the flavor but it shouldn't be
too<00:01:34.840> big<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.200> difference<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
too big of a difference this is the

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.539 
too big of a difference this is the
chocolate<00:01:36.849> peanut<00:01:37.209> butter<00:01:37.390> flavor<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:39.189> scoop

chocolate peanut butter flavor one scoop

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.660

is about 35 grams the total scoop you're
going<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.849> get<00:01:43.000> 25<00:01:43.869> grams<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.289> protein<00:01:44.579> 5<00:01:45.579> grams

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:45.879 
going to get 25 grams of protein 5 grams

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.760 
going to get 25 grams of protein 5 grams
of<00:01:46.030> carbohydrate<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.989> a<00:01:47.079> gram<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.439> half<00:01:47.619> of

fat so again a lot of companies throwing

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.690 
fat so again a lot of companies throwing
a<00:01:50.319> little<00:01:50.530> bit<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.709> fat<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.159> little<00:01:51.219> bit<00:01:51.640> of

a little bit of fat a little bit of

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.669 
a little bit of fat a little bit of
carbohydrate<00:01:52.390> for<00:01:52.629> flavoring<00:01:53.140> purposes

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
carbohydrate for flavoring purposes

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.039 
carbohydrate for flavoring purposes
getting<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.700> fact<00:01:54.969> and<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.209> has<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.329> thicker

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049

69<00:04:14.060> cents<00:04:14.420> per<00:04:14.630> serving<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.800> that's<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.370> little

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
69 cents per serving so that's a little

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.610 
69 cents per serving so that's a little
bit<00:04:16.730> more<00:04:16.850> economical<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.720> little<00:04:18.140> bit<00:04:18.230> cheaper

about ninety-eight cents per serving so

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.140

way that's going to have you know a

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.379 
way that's going to have you know a
little<00:05:08.589> bit<00:05:08.679> thinner<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.339> the<00:05:09.789> casey<00:05:10.059> is

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
little bit thinner and the casey is

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.389 
little bit thinner and the casey is
usually<00:05:11.139> going<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.379> have<00:05:11.529> you<00:05:11.769> know<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:11.919> lot

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:12.399 
usually going to have you know a lot

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.369 
usually going to have you know a lot
bigger<00:05:12.699> so<00:05:13.239> you<00:05:13.329> know<00:05:13.479> you<00:05:13.599> need<00:05:13.719> a<00:05:13.809> blend<00:05:14.199> of

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
bigger so you know you need a blend of

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.199 
bigger so you know you need a blend of
the<00:05:14.499> two<00:05:14.529> is<00:05:14.709> usually<00:05:15.189> going<00:05:15.279> to<00:05:15.339> be<00:05:15.549> there<00:05:15.969> for

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.209 
the two is usually going to be there for

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.059 
the two is usually going to be there for
me<00:05:16.329> at<00:05:16.449> least<00:05:16.509> the<00:05:17.019> consistency<00:05:17.589> that<00:05:17.619> I<00:05:17.799> like

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
me at least the consistency that I like

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.069 
me at least the consistency that I like
so<00:05:18.309> overall<00:05:18.849> one<00:05:19.449> of<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:19.599> best<00:05:19.779> tasting

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:20.079 
so overall one of the best tasting

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.589 
so overall one of the best tasting
protein<00:05:20.469> powders<00:05:20.889> I've<00:05:21.009> tried<00:05:21.279> so<00:05:21.519> in<00:05:22.419> my

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
protein powders I've tried so in my

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:23.759 
protein powders I've tried so in my
opinion<00:05:22.749> or<00:05:23.049> probably<00:05:23.289> not<00:05:23.379> going<00:05:23.499> to<00:05:23.559> have<00:05:23.709> a

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:23.769 
opinion or probably not going to have a

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:26.639 
opinion or probably not going to have a
troubled<00:05:24.429> time<00:05:24.729> with<00:05:24.969> it<00:05:25.119> but<00:05:25.269> again<00:05:25.649> with

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:26.649 
troubled time with it but again with

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.109 
troubled time with it but again with
most<00:05:26.829> protein<00:05:27.189> products<00:05:27.579> i<00:05:27.639> recommend<00:05:28.089> you

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.119 
most protein products i recommend you

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.119 
most protein products i recommend you
try<00:05:28.329> to<00:05:28.419> get<00:05:28.509> a<00:05:28.599> sample<00:05:29.079> maybe<00:05:29.649> your<00:05:29.799> friends

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
try to get a sample maybe your friends

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.709 
try to get a sample maybe your friends
try<00:05:30.309> to<00:05:30.369> try<00:05:30.729> it<00:05:30.789> there's<00:05:30.999> out<00:05:31.209> before<00:05:31.509> you<00:05:31.599> go

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
try to try it there's out before you go

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.379 
try to try it there's out before you go
and<00:05:31.839> buy<00:05:32.019> your<00:05:32.319> 30<00:05:32.499> 40<00:05:32.919> 50<00:05:33.459> bucks<00:05:33.879> on<00:05:34.029> a<00:05:34.119> product

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
and buy your 30 40 50 bucks on a product

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.669 
and buy your 30 40 50 bucks on a product
and<00:05:34.629> then<00:05:34.719> you<00:05:34.809> may<00:05:34.959> or<00:05:35.109> may<00:05:35.199> not<00:05:35.229> like<00:05:35.559> to

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:35.679 
and then you may or may not like to

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.510 
and then you may or may not like to
taste

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.850 

last<00:05:40.360> thing<00:05:40.569> i<00:05:40.629> want<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.870> touch<00:05:41.080> on<00:05:41.289> guys<00:05:41.500> was

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
last thing i want to touch on guys was

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.770 
last thing i want to touch on guys was
how<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.580> products<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.030> little<00:05:43.240> bit<00:05:43.330> unique

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
how this products a little bit unique

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.409 
how this products a little bit unique
from<00:05:44.139> other<00:05:44.289> ones<00:05:44.650> again<00:05:45.430> I'm<00:05:45.550> not<00:05:46.000> saying

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
from other ones again I'm not saying

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.480 
from other ones again I'm not saying
this<00:05:46.539> is<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.720> huge<00:05:47.139> deal<00:05:47.379> just<00:05:47.710> something<00:05:48.370> to

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
this is a huge deal just something to

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.149 
this is a huge deal just something to
consider<00:05:49.199> talking<00:05:50.199> about<00:05:50.319> it's<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.620> blended

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
consider talking about it's a blended

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.680 
consider talking about it's a blended
protein<00:05:51.340> so<00:05:51.789> what<00:05:51.909> I<00:05:51.940> mean<00:05:52.120> by<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.509> is

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
protein so what I mean by that is

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.110 
protein so what I mean by that is
sometimes<00:05:53.259> you<00:05:53.680> see<00:05:53.889> a<00:05:53.919> whey<00:05:54.159> protein<00:05:54.669> or

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
sometimes you see a whey protein or

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.390 
sometimes you see a whey protein or
Casey<00:05:55.509> and<00:05:55.810> protein<00:05:56.229> or<00:05:56.530> soy<00:05:56.740> protein<00:05:57.280> or

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
Casey and protein or soy protein or

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.219 
Casey and protein or soy protein or
whatever<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:58.210> has<00:05:58.419> several<00:05:58.810> different

whatever this has several different

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.890 
whatever this has several different
kinds<00:05:59.409> of<00:05:59.680> protein<00:06:00.069> in<00:06:00.190> it<00:06:00.310> oh<00:06:01.060> it<00:06:01.750> doesn't

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
kinds of protein in it oh it doesn't

actually<00:06:02.080> give<00:06:02.349> you<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.710> amount<00:06:03.400> of<00:06:03.639> each<00:06:03.789> one

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
actually give you the amount of each one

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.510 
actually give you the amount of each one

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
some added aminos and I'm not going to

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.999 
some added aminos and I'm not going to
get<00:06:18.340> into<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.759> you<00:06:19.270> know<00:06:19.710> flavors<00:06:20.710> and<00:06:20.860> things

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
get into the you know flavors and things

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.740 
get into the you know flavors and things
like<00:06:21.130> that<00:06:21.190> but<00:06:21.639> essentially<00:06:22.449> you're<00:06:22.569> getting

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
like that but essentially you're getting

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.120 
like that but essentially you're getting
a<00:06:22.840> mix<00:06:23.080> of<00:06:23.259> way<00:06:23.500> casey<00:06:23.919> and<00:06:24.250> egg<00:06:25.620> how<00:06:26.620> big<00:06:26.949> the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
a mix of way casey and egg how big the

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.290 
a mix of way casey and egg how big the
difference<00:06:27.460> that's<00:06:27.550> going<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.849> make<00:06:28.030> is

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
difference that's going to make is

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.480 
difference that's going to make is
probably<00:06:28.810> pretty<00:06:28.960> minimal<00:06:29.500> but<00:06:29.979> again<00:06:30.220> way

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
probably pretty minimal but again way

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.909 
probably pretty minimal but again way
usually<00:06:30.729> takes<00:06:31.539> care<00:06:31.810> of<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:32.020> know<00:06:32.139> enhancing

protein synthesis casey usually takes

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.189 
protein synthesis casey usually takes
care<00:06:35.530> of<00:06:35.580> decreasing<00:06:36.580> protein<00:06:37.150> breakdown<00:06:37.389> so

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
care of decreasing protein breakdown so

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.559 
care of decreasing protein breakdown so
those<00:06:38.560> two<00:06:38.800> kind<00:06:39.069> of<00:06:39.129> combine<00:06:39.610> provides<00:06:40.449> an

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
muscle in a sense again how much that's

muscle in a sense again how much that's
going<00:06:44.650> to<00:06:44.740> make<00:06:44.800> a<00:06:44.860> difference<00:06:45.069> you<00:06:45.370> know

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
going to make a difference you know

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.760 
going to make a difference you know
mixed<00:06:46.000> needles<00:06:46.360> and<00:06:46.599> throughout<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.259> day<00:06:47.469> is

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
mixed needles and throughout the day is

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.670 
mixed needles and throughout the day is
pretty<00:06:48.190> up<00:06:48.430> to<00:06:48.550> debate<00:06:48.849> but<00:06:49.150> again<00:06:49.680> another

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
pretty up to debate but again another

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.399 
pretty up to debate but again another
thing<00:06:50.949> to<00:06:51.550> consider<00:06:51.669> is<00:06:52.050> sometimes<00:06:53.050> a<00:06:53.199> way<00:06:53.349> to

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
thing to consider is sometimes a way to

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:55.290 
thing to consider is sometimes a way to
really<00:06:53.680> hide<00:06:53.979> certain<00:06:54.280> amino<00:06:54.490> acids<00:06:55.090> and

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
really hide certain amino acids and

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.749 
really hide certain amino acids and
that's<00:06:55.719> lacking<00:06:55.990> in<00:06:56.289> others<00:06:56.620> while<00:06:57.130> Casey<00:06:57.430> in

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 
that's lacking in others while Casey in

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.180 
that's lacking in others while Casey in
or<00:06:58.240> you<00:06:58.330> know<00:06:58.419> any<00:06:58.449> other<00:06:58.870> protein<00:06:59.229> source<00:06:59.740> may

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
or you know any other protein source may

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.980 
or you know any other protein source may
be<00:07:00.250> high<00:07:00.580> in<00:07:00.759> those<00:07:00.909> ones<00:07:01.150> is<00:07:01.360> the<00:07:01.659> ways

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
be high in those ones is the ways

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.519 
be high in those ones is the ways
lacking<00:07:02.560> so<00:07:02.800> you<00:07:03.159> kind<00:07:03.400> of<00:07:03.460> get<00:07:03.550> a<00:07:03.610> variety<00:07:04.330> of

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
lacking so you kind of get a variety of

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.499 
lacking so you kind of get a variety of
amino<00:07:05.529> acid<00:07:05.979> sources<00:07:06.550> again<00:07:07.150> that's<00:07:07.330> why<00:07:07.479> I

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
amino acid sources again that's why I

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:08.969 
amino acid sources again that's why I
typically<00:07:07.960> recommend<00:07:08.080> that<00:07:08.469> people<00:07:08.650> get<00:07:08.919> a

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
typically recommend that people get a

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.980 
typically recommend that people get a
variety<00:07:09.370> of<00:07:09.610> protein<00:07:10.120> sources<00:07:10.449> and<00:07:10.690> not<00:07:10.810> just

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
variety of protein sources and not just

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.170 
variety of protein sources and not just
you<00:07:11.110> know<00:07:11.229> all<00:07:11.680> that<00:07:11.889> from<00:07:12.250> egg<00:07:12.460> or<00:07:12.699> chicken<00:07:13.060> or

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
you know all that from egg or chicken or

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.480 
you know all that from egg or chicken or
way<00:07:13.630> or<00:07:13.870> whatever<00:07:14.110> so<00:07:14.469> some<00:07:15.159> things<00:07:15.190> to

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
way or whatever so some things to

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.620 
way or whatever so some things to
consider<00:07:15.610> if<00:07:16.000> you<00:07:16.090> really<00:07:16.240> want<00:07:16.389> to<00:07:16.419> think

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
consider if you really want to think

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.749 
consider if you really want to think
about<00:07:16.719> that<00:07:17.020> and<00:07:17.469> they<00:07:17.560> get<00:07:17.710> my<00:07:17.800> hat<00:07:17.949> said<00:07:18.219> the

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
about that and they get my hat said the

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.029 
about that and they get my hat said the
blended<00:07:19.270> proteins<00:07:19.719> generally<00:07:20.590> you<00:07:20.770> know<00:07:20.860> just

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
blended proteins generally you know just

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.350 
blended proteins generally you know just
my<00:07:21.219> opinion<00:07:21.610> have<00:07:21.699> a<00:07:21.729> little<00:07:21.940> bit<00:07:22.120> thicker

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
my opinion have a little bit thicker

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.530 
my opinion have a little bit thicker
consistency<00:07:22.599> in<00:07:23.259> a<00:07:23.349> better<00:07:23.560> taste

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040 
online you know it's usually going to be

online you know it's usually going to be
a<00:07:38.070> little<00:07:38.190> bit<00:07:38.400> cheaper<00:07:38.730> there<00:07:38.910> than<00:07:38.940> locally

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570 
a little bit cheaper there than locally

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.690

I'm not saying this is going to be

I'm not saying this is going to be
