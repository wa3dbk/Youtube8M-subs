00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 Talk to people, be welcome. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.040
 for over a video and this time here in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.139
 skate 3 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'm bringing a very simple video. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.029
 that will kill the curiosity of much 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 People there to the crowd then as the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.100
 title in this video I'll teach you to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 How do you do to get a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 colorful shape the same as I am 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 actually using the sandpaper part of the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 shape ne 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 You can see here is the sandpaper totally 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.010
 green, just like you have other players 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 that have other colors to the anthem in the sandpaper of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 shape 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 guys unfortunately is not so simple 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 get that sandpaper 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.460
 formerly on skate 3 had an option 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.739
 customization on a site where you had 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 some servers there you could 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.980
 customize from the clothes to the shape of the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.899
 skateboarding colorful letting it or not 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.789
 some time ago I think it was the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.379
 early 2013 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.379
 these servers were totally 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.049
 closed and there is no more of this option 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.110
 customization has generated enough revolt 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.420
 there and even my part is not like the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.150
 cars close the server so that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 nowadays there are many people who still 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.189
 they play iscte 3 right? 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.810
 but anyway guys do not have the option and the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.350
 way to get these chips 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 colorful are you have any friends on psn 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 They have them ok then those who did did 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 who did not do it more unfortunately is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 that's how it works 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 so the next guys are going 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.000
 or live do not know if in the xbox at the same time 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 procedure but I know that in the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 playstation 3 is like this and you will 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.479

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.399
 Have a colorful chip, okay? I will not. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.630

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.690

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.310
