00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
for the first time I think they're

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.580 
for the first time I think they're
worried<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.380> quite

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
worried that they're going to be quite

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
worried that they're going to be quite
isolated<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.000> experienced<00:01:33.510> live

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
isolated and the more experienced live

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
isolated and the more experienced live
players<00:01:34.110> may<00:01:34.800> not<00:01:34.980> help<00:01:35.159> them<00:01:35.370> out<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.670> that's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
players may not help them out but that's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
players may not help them out but that's
not<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.300> case<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.320> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
not really the case no I think it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170

to my friends next question what do you

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.800 
to my friends next question what do you
have<00:02:37.609> to<00:02:37.790> look<00:02:37.939> out<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.150> when<00:02:38.480> you're<00:02:38.629> playing

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
have to look out for when you're playing

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.039 
have to look out for when you're playing
a<00:02:38.959> live<00:02:39.139> tournament<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.859> first<00:02:39.920> time<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
a live tournament for the first time I

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.349 
a live tournament for the first time I
think<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.260> good<00:02:42.409> tip<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.799> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.159> draw<00:02:43.670> seat<00:02:44.030> one

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
think a good tip is if you draw seat one

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.860 
think a good tip is if you draw seat one
or<00:02:44.569> ten<00:02:44.870> yeah<00:02:45.379> next<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> dealer<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:47.540> very

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
or ten yeah next to the dealer it's very

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.110 
or ten yeah next to the dealer it's very
easy<00:02:48.109> for<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.500> D<00:02:48.709> that's<00:02:48.950> taking<00:02:49.669> your<00:02:49.700> card

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
easy for the D that's taking your card

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.149 
easy for the D that's taking your card
so<00:02:50.510> what<00:02:50.689> we<00:02:50.840> say<00:02:51.079> is<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.469> a<00:02:51.590> good<00:02:51.769> idea<00:02:51.889> to

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
so what we say is it's a good idea to

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.550 
so what we say is it's a good idea to
protect<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:52.909> hand<00:02:53.120> I've<00:02:53.780> got<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.049> gold<00:02:54.349> nugget

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
type online but a lot of players just

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.780

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
put a chip on top of their cards and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.550 
put a chip on top of their cards and
it's<00:02:59.359> important<00:02:59.750> because<00:02:59.840> if<00:03:00.109> you're<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.319> seat

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
one or ten very often the dealer will

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.030 
one or ten very often the dealer will
scoop<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.719> cards<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.169> take<00:03:03.409> your<00:03:03.590> cards<00:03:04.010> and

the<00:04:09.859> easiest<00:04:09.979> way<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.400> do<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:10.819> is<00:04:11.269> just<00:04:11.329> say

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the easiest way to do it is just say

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.749 
the easiest way to do it is just say
I've<00:04:12.079> bet<00:04:12.319> ten<00:04:12.560> thousand<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.280> then<00:04:13.459> put

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:13.759 
I've bet ten thousand and then put

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.479 
I've bet ten thousand and then put
10,000<00:04:14.569> chips<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.739> come<00:04:15.919> on<00:04:16.009> you<00:04:16.099> practice

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
10,000 chips in so come on you practice

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.569 
10,000 chips in so come on you practice
a<00:04:16.579> little<00:04:16.870> bit<00:04:17.870> tense<00:04:18.199> at<00:04:18.380> 10,000<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.430> could

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
a little bit tense at 10,000 so I could

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.709 
a little bit tense at 10,000 so I could
even<00:04:19.699> just<00:04:19.820> put<00:04:20.030> them<00:04:20.150> all<00:04:20.269> down<00:04:20.299> like<00:04:20.599> that

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:20.719 
even just put them all down like that

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.390 
even just put them all down like that
that's<00:04:20.930> fine<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.560> what<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.979> can't<00:04:22.219> do

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that's fine and that what you can't do

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.950 
that's fine and that what you can't do
is<00:04:22.430> show<00:04:22.669> nothing<00:04:22.880> let's<00:04:23.240> go<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.419> think<00:04:23.599> I<00:04:23.810> went

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.390 
not playing and the cards are gone but
this<00:05:11.110> side<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.590> line<00:05:11.620> nothing<00:05:12.100> happens

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
this side of the line nothing happens

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.310 
this side of the line nothing happens
until<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.730> actually<00:05:12.880> make<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.300> bet<00:05:13.660> where<00:05:14.170> you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
until you actually make a bet where you

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.230 
until you actually make a bet where you
actually<00:05:14.830> put<00:05:15.250> your<00:05:15.400> chips<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.030> then<00:05:16.120> when

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
actually put your chips in and then when

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.060 
actually put your chips in and then when
they<00:05:16.330> cross<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.720> line<00:05:16.900> that's<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.740> border

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
they cross the line that's the border

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.500 
they cross the line that's the border
and<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:18.520> when<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:18.790> actually<00:05:18.970> made<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.270> bet

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.380 
so you don't even need to say that you
can<00:05:21.250> afford<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.670> could<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:21.970> push<00:05:22.120> them<00:05:22.270> on
