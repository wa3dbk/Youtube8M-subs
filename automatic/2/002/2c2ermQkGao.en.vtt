00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
ornament out of a jar lid I think this

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.780 
ornament out of a jar lid I think this
is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> really<00:00:10.320> cool<00:00:10.530> idea<00:00:10.740> because<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.610> go

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
is a really cool idea because you can go

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.490 
is a really cool idea because you can go
to<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.360> store<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> lot<00:00:13.349> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
to the store and you can get a lot of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.530 
to the store and you can get a lot of
jar<00:00:14.190> lids<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
jar lids and you can actually have the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.450 
jar lids and you can actually have the
jars<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.020> later<00:00:16.230> too<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:16.740> they're<00:00:17.250> really

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
jars for later too but they're really

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.750 
jars for later too but they're really
cheap<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.810> fun<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.609> do

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
cheap so it's fun and what you can do

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
cheap so it's fun and what you can do

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that's sort of interesting sometimes is

take your old Christmas cards and you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.820 
take your old Christmas cards and you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
can find different parts of them that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.130 
can find different parts of them that
you<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> these<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.300> had<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you like like one of these I had was a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.750 
you like like one of these I had was a
deer<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> I've<00:00:28.980> already<00:00:29.160> cut<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
deer and I've already cut it out

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.749 
deer and I've already cut it out
basically<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.689> found<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> car<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> liked<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
basically I found the car that I liked I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
basically I found the car that I liked I
used<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> template<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> tracer<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
used this as a template or a tracer I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.600 
used this as a template or a tracer I
traced<00:00:35.910> around<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.840> cut<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> out<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
traced around it I cut it out and then I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
traced around it I cut it out and then I
may<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> other<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
may find one for the other side but I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
may find one for the other side but I
think<00:00:40.649> maybe<00:00:40.890> maybe<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> photo

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
think maybe maybe I want to put a photo

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
think maybe maybe I want to put a photo
on<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> other<00:00:43.050> side<00:00:43.320> too<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.910> basically<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
on the other side too so basically I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.170 
on the other side too so basically I
will<00:00:45.120> trace<00:00:45.450> around<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.320> too<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.460> cut

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
will trace around this one too and cut

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
will trace around this one too and cut
it<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
it out so you're going to have one on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.990 
it out so you're going to have one on
one<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.910> side<00:00:51.920> so

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
one side and one on the other side so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.630 
one side and one on the other side so
basically<00:00:54.000> cut<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> circular<00:00:55.050> way

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
basically cut that out in a circular way

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
basically cut that out in a circular way
whatever<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.140> photo<00:00:58.410> or

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
whatever and then I take the photo or

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.060 
whatever and then I take the photo or
the<00:00:58.920> card<00:00:59.309> sorry<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> front

that you might add to it to make it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
that you might add to it to make it
really<00:01:16.350> cool<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.979> you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> glue<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
down then what you would do is turn over

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499 
down then what you would do is turn over
on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> other<00:01:19.259> side<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
on the other side and you would put the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
on the other side and you would put the
other<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> sometimes<00:01:22.979> I

I just put I just put it on there with
just<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.860> okay<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> flip<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> over

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
just one side okay then you flip it over

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
just one side okay then you flip it over
and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:33.630> one<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.930> just

and you put the other one on it just

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.390
