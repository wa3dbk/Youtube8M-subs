00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Adam Khaliyev is a rather positive person. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.649
 and educated with great sports 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.690
 the beginning as a mixed fighter recalls 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.309
 style first coach who 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 and took him away from school in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 the youth team was ondora 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.480
 balaev over the years 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.730
 he trained from his section 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.189
 taekwondo and the backbone of his 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.590
 physical development got it from 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.990
 main trainers of the Chechen team 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.700
 the Chechen Republic and started back 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.820
 known to 2 companies 99 2000 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 back was the same in from the Chechen troops 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 republics and who where did 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.699
 many republics many have died 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.980
 during this, and I hope this is the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.980
 two companies meaning they are many 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 have undermined not only me many years 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 the wars in Chechnya actually changed 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.840
 Much almost no family anyone at that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.479
 the unfortunate time this event is not 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.000
 touched a lot of grief and sadness 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.310
 however today it is a republic he is only 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.270
 people in a formidable city 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.659
 five sons and a mother who led 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.780
 children sporting life from the earliest 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.020
 childhood rustam gave them some hope 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 on like compound everyone said that he 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 very talented that they imitated the sector 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.610

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.300
 training first time all the time and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.580
 I saw off and met honestly I did not 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 I thought that over the years it will of course 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.120
 now very hard now i'm happy and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 endured

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.790
 I learned myself through words very much 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.370
 passed independently but not without help 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.890

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.340
