just to kind of start to loosen things

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390 
just to kind of start to loosen things
up<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:27.650> we'll<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> same<00:00:29.160> on

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
can use our fingers to keep prying it

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.630 
can use our fingers to keep prying it
open<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.780> little<00:01:22.900> bit<00:01:23.080> little<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.340> can<00:01:30.460> see

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.190 
open a little bit little you can see
it's<00:01:30.760> slightly<00:01:30.880> separated<00:01:31.690> here<00:01:31.840> at<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.020> top

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
it's slightly separated here at the top

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.940 
it's slightly separated here at the top
already<00:01:34.260> we're<00:01:35.260> just<00:01:35.410> going<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.620> keep<00:01:35.710> working

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
already we're just going to keep working

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.780 
already we're just going to keep working
at<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.640> can<00:01:39.790> wiggle<00:01:39.970> these<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:41.580> little<00:01:42.580> side

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
at it you can wiggle these a little side

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.530 
at it you can wiggle these a little side
things<00:01:43.090> here

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
things here

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.210 
things here
it'll<00:01:43.990> help<00:01:44.080> loosen<00:01:44.470> things<00:01:44.590> up<00:01:44.800> there's<00:01:45.070> no

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
it'll help loosen things up there's no

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.410 
it'll help loosen things up there's no
screws<00:01:45.520> holding<00:01:45.850> these<00:01:45.970> together<00:01:46.150> or

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
screws holding these together or

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.670 
screws holding these together or
anything<00:01:46.750> or<00:01:46.960> any<00:01:47.080> kind<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.260> rivets<00:01:47.560> or

anything or any kind of rivets or

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.040 
anything or any kind of rivets or
fasteners<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.180> if<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.360> just<00:01:49.540> kind<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.780> pry<00:01:50.020> on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
fasteners so if you just kind of pry on

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.600 
fasteners so if you just kind of pry on
these<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.560> kind<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.770> helps<00:01:51.040> loosen<00:01:51.250> everything

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
these it kind of helps loosen everything

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:13.390 
these it kind of helps loosen everything
up

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.680 

now<00:02:14.400> we're<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.550> doing<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.180> bit<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
now we're just doing this a little bit a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.230 
now we're just doing this a little bit a
little<00:02:15.960> bit<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.130> don't<00:02:17.280> risk<00:02:18.000> doing

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
little bit just so we don't risk doing

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.070 
little bit just so we don't risk doing
any<00:02:18.480> damage<00:02:20.450> although<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> suspect<00:02:21.900> there's<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
any damage although I suspect there's a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.150 
any damage although I suspect there's a
good<00:02:22.230> chance<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.800> rip<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:22.980> apart

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
good chance you can just rip it apart

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730 
good chance you can just rip it apart
and<00:02:23.460> you'd<00:02:23.580> probably<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.970> fine<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:25.380> why<00:02:25.530> take

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
and you'd probably be fine but why take

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.760 
and you'd probably be fine but why take
the<00:02:25.890> risk

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
the risk

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.750 
the risk
okay<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.190> bit<00:02:29.280> more<00:02:29.550> open<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
okay it's a little bit more open now and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
okay it's a little bit more open now and
you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.910> see<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.210> glue<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.560> there<00:02:34.710> as<00:02:34.890> we

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you can see the glue down in there as we

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.710 
you can see the glue down in there as we
slowly<00:02:35.460> pull<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> apart<00:02:37.790> there<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.060> one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
slowly pull it apart there we go one

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.910 
slowly pull it apart there we go one
side<00:02:39.990> off<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.750> kind<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.740> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
side off you can kind of see the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.700 
side off you can kind of see the
thickness<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.610> adhesive<00:02:48.090> there

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
thickness of the adhesive there

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.350 
thickness of the adhesive there
nothing<00:02:49.710> fancy<00:02:49.860> looks<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.400> 3m<00:02:50.790> tape<00:02:51.000> kind<00:02:51.300> of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
nothing fancy looks like 3m tape kind of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:02.180 
nothing fancy looks like 3m tape kind of
stuff<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.710> to<00:03:01.830> pull<00:03:02.040> directly

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
stuff and now we have to pull directly

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.550 
stuff and now we have to pull directly
in<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.580> memory<00:03:02.790> stick<00:03:03.600> itself<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.350> very

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
in the memory stick itself so be very

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.010 
in the memory stick itself so be very
careful<00:03:05.100> here<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:06.450> see<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.720> adhesive

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
careful here you can see the adhesive

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.520 
careful here you can see the adhesive
giving<00:03:07.650> way<00:03:07.770> little<00:03:08.070> by<00:03:08.220> little<00:03:09.440> carefully<00:03:10.440> in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
giving way little by little carefully in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.590 
giving way little by little carefully in
here<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:10.980> these<00:03:11.100> corners<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.550> doesn't<00:03:11.790> catch

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.890 

and<00:03:15.600> we're<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.020> gently<00:03:16.260> work<00:03:16.740> this

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
and we're just going to gently work this

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:33.130 
and we're just going to gently work this
back<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.110> forth

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.900
