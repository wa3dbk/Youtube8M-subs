camcorder<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.979> makes<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
camcorder did not have so it makes it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.819 
camcorder did not have so it makes it
really<00:01:47.549> hard<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.869> wanted<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.799> know

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
really hard if you wanted to you know

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.679 
really hard if you wanted to you know
take<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> picture<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.210> remember<00:01:51.509> where<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
take a picture to remember where you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.190 
take a picture to remember where you
were<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> specific<00:01:53.090> video<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.659> didn't<00:01:55.020> allow

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
were in a specific video it didn't allow

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
were in a specific video it didn't allow
you<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you to do that other than that the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819 
you to do that other than that the
cameras<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.659> pretty<00:01:57.750> much<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> same<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.680> far

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
cameras are pretty much the same as far

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.639 
cameras are pretty much the same as far
as<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.100> tell<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.689> I<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.500> give

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
as I can tell but I do just have to give

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.310 
as I can tell but I do just have to give
this<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.360> definite<00:02:03.360> thumbs<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.810> over<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
this one the definite thumbs up over the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100 
this one the definite thumbs up over the
other<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.670> nicer<00:02:05.700> camera<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
other one it's a much nicer camera for a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
other one it's a much nicer camera for a
difference<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> 100<00:02:07.860> bucks<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.310> would

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
difference of 100 bucks I would

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.599 
difference of 100 bucks I would
definitely<00:02:08.940> say<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.569> it
