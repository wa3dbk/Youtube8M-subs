00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
hot chocolate so and so the water is hot

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.620 
hot chocolate so and so the water is hot
enough<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.700> melts<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> chocolate

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
enough that it melts the chocolate

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.860 
enough that it melts the chocolate
immediately<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:27.120> you're<00:03:27.269> basically<00:03:27.690> what

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
immediately and you're basically what

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.130 
immediately and you're basically what
you're<00:03:27.930> doing<00:03:27.989> now<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.650> emulsifying<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.190 

so<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.230> gets<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.470> nice<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.860> thick<00:03:36.200> it's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so it gets it nice and thick it's

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.850 
so it gets it nice and thick it's
beautiful

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.360 

so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
so

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.809 
so
so<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.920> now<00:03:44.950> what<00:03:45.190> we're<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.640> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
so now so now what we're going to do is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.000 
so now so now what we're going to do is
you<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.420> pour<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.230> cup<00:03:47.500> but

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010
