those<00:01:41.490> things<00:01:41.640> together<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.570> for

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
those things together you think that for

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
those things together you think that for
1.2<00:01:43.259> gigahertz<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> smoother

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
1.2 gigahertz it will be a bit smoother

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.380 
1.2 gigahertz it will be a bit smoother
here<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.570> oh<00:01:46.200> well

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
here but oh well

beta<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:12.630> okay<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.660> say<00:02:13.870> at<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> display

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
beta and okay I say at the display

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
beta and okay I say at the display
display<00:02:15.010> is

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
running cidp you can hopefully watch

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.580 
running cidp you can hopefully watch
those<00:02:21.120> liquid<00:02:21.420> smoother<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.439> could

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
those liquid smoother then you could

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.660 
those liquid smoother then you could
watch<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.870> overall<00:02:25.670> menus

watch you your thing the overall menus
building<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.269> here<00:02:27.540> look<00:02:28.349> closely<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.890> still

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
building up here look closely you still

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.670 
building up here look closely you still
see<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:30.269> Google<00:02:30.540> store<00:02:30.689> somewhere<00:02:31.290> hidden

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
see the Google store somewhere hidden

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 
see the Google store somewhere hidden
and<00:02:32.569> yeah<00:02:33.569> this<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.870> probably<00:02:34.079> not<00:02:34.200> legally

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and yeah this is probably not legally

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.069
