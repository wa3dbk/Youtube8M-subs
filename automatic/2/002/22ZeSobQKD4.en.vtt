00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.330
 hello to you dmytro lutsenko 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.550
 project company com and our almost constant 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.650
 rubric angra software first todays 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.930
 the application will be blue, many remember 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.100
 parallax effect available on the latest 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.170
 ios versions 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.510
 if he allowed to change position 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.850
 icons and wallpapers in tus space not 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.859
 able to move objects in the frame on the photos 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.379
 The process of taking photographs is extremely 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.019
 simple the application itself analyzes 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.940
 frame and converts it into a kind of 3d model 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.159
 which you can save on 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.199
 At first, the result is such 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.600
 myself but judging by the works of other people 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.909
 you just need to get your hand on the way out 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.190
 will be sweetie many of us use 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.620
 clouds to make room 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.019
 on a smartphone it would be cool if you could 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.909
 was to simplify the process of transferring files 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.250
 to the network namely to make them 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.030
 immediately flew into the clouds when they were removed from 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.190
 smartphone 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.409
 just so the creators thought 2 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.600
 of today's application called dump 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.030
 start essentially its main idea I already 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.250
 conveyed if someone did not understand it is a service 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.799
 removes such operations from your life 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.899
 like choosing unnecessary files and sending them 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.210
 into the cloud now it happens by itself 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.340
 yourself every time you delete something 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.859
 from the smartphone in the settings you can specify 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.750
 which file types to send to 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.939
 networks how many need to be stored as 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 says nothing extra in the world where 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.259
 many smartphones are limited in volume 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.479
 internal dumpster memory is 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.399
 very good solution especially for 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.439
 people have appetite and who are not at all 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.780
 corresponds to the storage capacity of them 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.479
 smartphones 1 today's game is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.549
 bridge chihiro before us a circle on it 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.159
 running mustache dude we need 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.229
 save from funny monsters first 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.240
 sneaker our runner starts his way all 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.640
 the rest of the touch make you jump 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 baleen animals in theory everything is pretty 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.490
 simple but to practice the tasks before us 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 from the lungs as you see dial decent 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.689
 the number of eyes is quite difficult for 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.030
 analogies with many other wild 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.340
 complex games this instance is quite 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 able to attract the attention of people who 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.319
 not afraid of difficult tasks are recruited 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.150
 patience we take in hand set 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.430
 the bridge a little ilu and be with you 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.950
 self control last tonight 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.019
 the application is an online game 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.630
 we play for something that flies by 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.880
 the long corridor to the screen is 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.489
 it's nothing to cling to the nearest 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.989
 point of support and Panova revolves around it 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.000
 formed radius 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.130
 when we let go of hospitals not that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.290
 continues to fly tangentially from 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.269
 the point at which she was at the moment 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.040
 taking your finger off the screen if you 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.769
 bump into the wall during free 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.049
 flight you lost this toy is not 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.120
 claims to be typical and 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.730
 like past train accuracy and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.530
 reaction thanks to the unusual gameplay and 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.959
 cool graphics game fast 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.150
 attracts attention to himself unequivocally 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.340
 I recommend trying to anyone who has not yet 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.260
 I managed to play it 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.269
 if you know cool games or 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.430
 apps for android write them 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.350
 titles in the comments to this video 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.840
