00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.950
 cool 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.929
 I called more help, we were, it was cool, I hope. 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 to recover quickly I regret that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 happened and that everything goes well in your 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 recovery is fine 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.920
 Fighting cool, I got neymar like 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.600
 went back 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 logical that it would be in a context 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.529
 I do not believe you would like more 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 anyway it's an emotion as it is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.599
 that was your return your meeting as 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.270
 being your recovery and waiting 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:37.879
 from now on is a good good night 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.700
 Afternoon, everyone, I'm really happy. 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.899
 for having come back to find my 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 companions 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 it is clear that in a situation we say that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.989
 Bad but only gave and got opportunity 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 is walking is reviewing my 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.899
 comrades and that's what I told you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.059
 If we started together here then. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 Let's finish it together so I came back 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.610
 to end along with the companies 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.580
 regardless of what happened 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 if we can not get the title anyway 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 It matters that we are closed together and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.360
 let's end up honestly honoring 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.600
 shirt that we love want shirt that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.180
 that we always invest and that's it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 What are we doing on Saturday? 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 I hope that from now on we 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:41.790
 be as cheerful as ever because of a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.880
 defeat is a defeat practically 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 that we have to 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.430
 put your head down you have to walk your head 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.640
 low 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 is part of football is the sport 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 The sport is like this is beyond the field to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.399
 win or lose and I'm a guy of mine 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.409
 friends even joked with me here that I 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.500
 I do not like losing in any way 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.890
 in law of street ball still nothing 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.239
 in the sport that I love very painful 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.390
 it's going to hurt a lot of time it's going to go 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.270
 pass and 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.300
 better days will come, we'll make 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.090
 everything so that we can return to 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.850
 joy to the Brazilian people 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.330
 our families and especially the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.120
 to our faces right because your look 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.810
 for each of each player 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 you see that the face of sadness is a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.880
 boring countenance and I hope that people 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.270
 Can you smile again faster? 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.820
 possible and coming back here, what I 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.300
 left happy but left happy that 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.830
 in the rain was accompanied there that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:58.150
 have had people cheering and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.019
 shouting the players' names after 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.459
 a defeat that has not yet made 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.560
 I thank all the fans who 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.739

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.370
 responsibility to have lost is a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.530
