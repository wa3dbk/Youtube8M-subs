see<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.100> everything<00:02:35.580> started<00:02:35.819> cracking

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
see that everything started cracking

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.680 
see that everything started cracking
because<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> heat<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.090> didn't<00:02:39.420> want<00:02:39.569> all

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
because of the heat so I didn't want all

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.130 
because of the heat so I didn't want all
this<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> fall<00:02:40.200> off<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:41.480> got<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.599> stand<00:02:42.870> cost

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
this to fall off so I got the stand cost

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
this to fall off so I got the stand cost
me<00:02:43.260> 20<00:02:43.530> bucks<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.040> had<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.510> wattage

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
me 20 bucks I had to up the wattage

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.190 
me 20 bucks I had to up the wattage
about<00:02:46.110> by<00:02:46.890> 50<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.519> have<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.819> 150<00:02:48.480> watt<00:02:48.630> bulb<00:02:48.989> in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
about by 50 I have a 150 watt bulb in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.900 
about by 50 I have a 150 watt bulb in
there

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
there

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.979
