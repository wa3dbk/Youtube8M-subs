00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
underneath which is 12 mil I'm hunting

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.390 
underneath which is 12 mil I'm hunting
12<00:02:05.450> obviously<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.020> side<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.280> I've

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400

given<00:02:14.090> me<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.240> nice<00:02:14.480> central<00:02:15.040> support

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
given me a nice central support

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.680 
given me a nice central support
let's<00:02:16.610> give<00:02:16.820> me<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.970> nice<00:02:17.120> gap<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.540> bottom

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
let's give me a nice gap at the bottom

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.940 
let's give me a nice gap at the bottom
I've<00:02:18.470> also<00:02:18.710> set<00:02:19.160> them<00:02:19.310> back<00:02:19.550> slightly<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.890> you

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
I've also set them back slightly as you

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.570 
I've also set them back slightly as you
can<00:02:22.190> save<00:02:22.430> 12<00:02:22.850> nil<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.890> they<00:02:25.040> sit<00:02:25.220> back<00:02:25.400> to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
can save 12 nil here so they sit back to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.700 
can save 12 nil here so they sit back to
our<00:02:25.700> milk<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.810> enables<00:02:27.200> me<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.410> put

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
given me a pointless draw this is just

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.050 
given me a pointless draw this is just
here<00:03:07.760> give<00:03:07.880> me<00:03:07.970> enough<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.780> draw<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:10.610> my

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
here give me enough I have a draw for my

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.680 
here give me enough I have a draw for my
top

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.500 

sufficient<00:03:17.910> obviously<00:03:18.910> we're<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> few<00:03:19.330> more

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
sufficient obviously we're a few more

I'm<00:03:19.630> stopping<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.140> wheels<00:03:20.350> will<00:03:20.650> go<00:03:20.800> in<00:03:20.980> as

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
I'm stopping the wheels will go in as

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.050 
I'm stopping the wheels will go in as
well<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.550> that's<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.570> idea<00:03:22.870> behind<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:24.060> yeah

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
well so that's the idea behind it yeah

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.690 
well so that's the idea behind it yeah
all<00:03:25.210> in<00:03:25.360> all<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.990> probably<00:03:26.440> cost<00:03:26.710> me<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.310> far

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
all in all it's probably cost me so far

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.430 
all in all it's probably cost me so far
I<00:03:28.060> would<00:03:28.360> think<00:03:28.600> about<00:03:28.870> four<00:03:29.080> hundred<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
I would think about four hundred and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.760 
I would think about four hundred and
fifty<00:03:29.710> dollars<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> make<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:31.530> I've<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
fifty dollars to make this I've got the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.970 
fifty dollars to make this I've got the
carpet<00:03:32.980> all<00:03:33.310> ready<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.940> go<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.240> on<00:03:34.540> there<00:03:34.980> and
